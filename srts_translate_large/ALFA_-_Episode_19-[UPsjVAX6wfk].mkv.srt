00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Participants have to dive to the bottom of the lake.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When they arrive at the bottom of the lake,

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
they have to take a net that has been protected by their tail.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Papadita!

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Give it to me!

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So, for this first match,

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the winner is...

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alva!

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I have to think about it.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How can I beat Alva?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I need Alva.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She can't take part in the next match.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know how to do it.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Help!

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Her voice is around here.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Where is she?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Help!

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Open it!

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Open it!

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Kids,

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
the match will start in 15 minutes.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For the participants,

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
gather at the school page as soon as possible.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Where is Alva?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why is she missing?

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where is Alva?

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've been looking for her for a long time.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alva must be eliminated.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What if Alva is here?

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What should I do?

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alva must be here.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going to look for Alva.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where is Alva?

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't take it anymore.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Where is Alva?

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to look for Alva.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's getting darker.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Who is she?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She's around here.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I must find her.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
To be continued...

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm going to look for Alva.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where is she?

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Calm down.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm going to look for Alva.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm going to look for Alva.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't worry about me.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Calm down.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just sleep.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going to look for Alva.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If you want to attack me again,

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can attack you back.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Look at this.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not moving.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is bad.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
To be continued...

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's dangerous.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because there's a reptile inside.

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A reptile?

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How can a reptile be in a school?

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is a reptile.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Actually,

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I caught it from the forest.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's still wild.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, it's dangerous.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's too bad.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I heard a scary sound.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Luckily, there's a reptile inside.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's scary.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The problem is,

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm preparing a cage for the reptile.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, I'm going to put it in the cage.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Stay away from the cage.

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't come near it. It's dangerous.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is the food that reptiles like.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you sure?

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's why I told you not to come near it.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's better to come near the competition.

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's go.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Help!

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Help!

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Help!

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Help!

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Help me!

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Alfa must be scared.

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because he's late.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Professor Aldebaran.

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's time.

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We're going to start now.

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Kids.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The competition will start in five minutes.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
For those who are not here yet,

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the participants will be eliminated.

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Bro.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was playing in the dark.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In the dark?

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Really?

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not lying.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I saw it in the mirror.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I looked for it, but I couldn't find it.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's a crow and a lazy cow.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't lie.

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're dreaming.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's true.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm not lying.

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm not dreaming.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not lying.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's a horse eating a donut.

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm just kidding.

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't be mad.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Vega.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Maybe you're still traumatized...

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
by being in the dark.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So, keep thinking.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Really, Tendara?

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes, you're stressed.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Instead of thinking about it,

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
it's better to ask Alfa.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, your mind will be calm.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And you'll be happy.

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Your heart will be at ease.

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And you'll feel better.

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay?

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Help!

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Help!

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's attacking.

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey, Alfa.

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mr. Titan.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you doing?

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's like a cow eating a donut, Alfa.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Enough.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Go away.

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't want to be helped.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's dangerous.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This kind of problem is annoying, Alfa.

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Enough.

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Go away.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're going to join the race, right?

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Race?

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I want to go first.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You need this...

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to win the race.

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Get in.

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Zira.

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No, thank you.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What is it for?

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You'll understand.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay, Sir.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank you.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you, Sir.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Take this.

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
To Be Continued...

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not here.

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where is it?

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Gosh.

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is weird.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Where is Alva?

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm scared, Tom.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes, I'm scared.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's go before the war.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Kids.

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Now, I'll start counting.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Five.

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Four.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Three.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Two.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
One.

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hurray, Alva is here.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you, Sir.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Finally, you're here too, Alva.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Where have you been?

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Where have I been?

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But, King.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll replace you.

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But, King.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll replace you.

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have something to do.

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Kids.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The competition will start soon.

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The rule is...

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Every contestant...

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
must get three horses...

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
from Gadis Angsa.

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Three horses from Gadis Angsa.

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Where can we get them?

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
She doesn't like men.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Get the door.

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Kids.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is the magic door.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Every contestant...

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
who enters the magic door...

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
will go to the residence of Gadis Angsa.

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's start...

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
with the first contestant.

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Please.

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Rey.

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Two.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Three.

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Four.

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Five.

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Six.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Seven.

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Eight.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Nine.

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ten.

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Eleven.

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Twelve.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Thirteen.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Fourteen.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Fifteen.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Sixteen.

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Seventeen.

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Eighteen.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Nineteen.

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Twenty.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Twenty.

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Ouch.

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's the Gadis Angsa.

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
How can we get the 30 horses?

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I know.

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Get the red door.

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's so hard to be a conservationist.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why can't I get the red door?

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I want...

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the red door.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The red one.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
GADIS ANGSA

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Now, I want to be a woman.

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hi, Gadis Angsa.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, I did it.

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hi, Gadis Angsa.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Who are you?

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm Rey.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't say Rey.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm Reyina.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why don't you remember me?

249
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm the one from that time.

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So, what are you doing here?

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm lost.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can't go back there.

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I have to go to school.

254
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I want to get the 30 horses.

255
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Poor you.

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What should we do?

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We don't want to give it to them.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Right?

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes.

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Where should we give it to?

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We can give it to them.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But, only to people...

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
who can understand us.

264
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
How?

265
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's the secret.

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Right, girls?

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's right.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Gadis Angsa is happy.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know.

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We can...

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
give it to vegetables.

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why vegetables?

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We don't like it.

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We're not normal.

275
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Right?

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right.

277
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Girls.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yippee!

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We got it.

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What's wrong with you?

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I got hit.

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How?

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I got hit.

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I got hit.

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Calm down, girls.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Because you didn't get the grasshopper,

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
you're disqualified.

288
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You did it.

289
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Alva, you have to succeed.

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Just trust us.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes, sir.

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You can't lose.

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes, Alva.

294
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
If you lose, I'll replace you.

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Alva and I know...

296
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
what's the secret of Gadis Angsa.

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If I knew it,

298
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Papi would have told me.

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Today, I'll win.

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And now,

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
the next contestant.

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Tommy.

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Tommy!

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But, boss.

305
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He got hit.

306
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Tommy!

307
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
There's a man.

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Attack!

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Wait.

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I have something for you.

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Here.

312
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Thank you, boss.

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Wait.

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If you want to compete with this red flower,

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
you have to give three of your Angsa feathers.

316
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yippee!

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yippee!

318
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What do you think, teachers?

319
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Is it real?

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What do you think, Professor Agni?

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Can you guarantee it's real?

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's real, Megantara.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's real, professor.

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's real. What do we do?

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You have to do it, Alva.

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Alva, you have to win.

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You can't lose to Tommy.

328
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And now,

329
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the next contestant.

330
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Please, Alva.

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's real.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Be careful, Alva.

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's real.

334
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's real.

335
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I can hear it.

336
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hi, everyone.

337
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's a man.

338
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's Alva.

339
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Are you here to ask for our feathers, too?

340
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Like your friend?

341
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes.

342
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Can I?

343
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Of course.

344
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Thank you, Megantara.

345
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yippee!

346
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't!

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Our feathers are precious.

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't just give it to him.

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But I know you want to help him.

350
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Sure.

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
As long as he can pay with something worth it.

352
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
To win the contest.

353
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I have something.

354
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What is it?

355
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's real.

356
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's real.

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's real.

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yippee!

359
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Alva, can you give us more?

360
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We still need more.

361
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We have 10.

362
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I know.

363
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I got it.

364
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's a camera.

365
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's a twin camera.

366
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If you take a picture,

367
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the number will be high.

368
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Do you believe me?

369
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay, I'll try.

370
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll try.

371
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
There.

372
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We have 10, right?

373
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yippee!

374
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yippee!

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Here, Alva.

376
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Why are there so many?

377
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I only said three.

378
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Alva, this is a bonus for you.

379
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because you made us happy.

380
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Is it true?

381
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's true.

382
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay.

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Thank you.

384
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why isn't Alva here yet?

385
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's been so long.

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm worried.

387
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I know, it's been so long.

388
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Be patient.

389
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Alva will be here soon.

390
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Alva is great.

391
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Alva will succeed.

392
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Trust me.

393
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Alva won't win this time.

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The winner is Honyok!

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What do you think, Alva?

396
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I didn't get it, Prof.

397
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
See, it's true. Alva didn't do anything.

398
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
She failed.

399
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But, I have something.

400
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Here's the proof.

401
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
To prove it,

402
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
we'll hand it over to Prof. Akli.

403
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Akli will investigate which one is fake and which one is real.

404
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Please.

405
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Alva! Alva! Alva!

406
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What do you think, Prof. Akli?

407
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What?

408
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's real.

409
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Real?

410
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's real, Prof.

411
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And it's more than Tommy.

412
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And it's more than Tommy.

413
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If that's the case,

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
for the second match,

415
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
the winner is...

416
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Alva!

417
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Alva! Alva! Alva!

418
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Attention, kids.

419
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The third match...

420
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
will be held in three days.

421
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, to the contestants,

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Alva and Tommy,

423
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
please get ready.

424
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, sir.

425
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Prof. Alhara, why are you here?

426
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We can do it.

427
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We can do it.

428
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's right.

429
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Your opponent is me, Prof. Alhara.

430
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Bang!

431
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You're dead.

432
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I will make this laptop mine.

433
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I will use it.

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Get ready.

435
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Stamper.

436
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Stamper is a sign...

437
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
that you're mine.

438
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You're mine.

439
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You're mine.

440
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
How did you know...

441
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
that the colors of the pencil...

442
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
are brown and pink?

443
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't know.

444
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I was given by Prof. Titan.

445
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Wow.

446
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That's cheating.

447
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Cheating?

448
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Cheating?

449
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Cheating.

450
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Prof. Titan gave you a sketchbook.

451
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He didn't give me a sketchbook.

452
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
He only gave me brown and pink.

453
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He said it would be useful.

454
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's the same.

455
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Prof. Titan knows how to draw.

456
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm getting lazy.

457
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Vega.

458
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't be like that.

459
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Prof. Titan is a good person.

460
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
He's my teacher.

461
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You too.

462
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I was saved...

463
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
when I met Sir Raptor.

464
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Sir Raptor?

465
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The one in the warehouse?

466
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yes.

467
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I was trapped there.

468
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I became Prof. Titan.

469
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I want to be like you.

470
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Alva.

471
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Come here.

472
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I became suspicious of Prof. Titan.

473
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Why does he keep helping Alva?

474
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What does he mean?

475
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Alva was helped by Prof. Titan...

476
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
to get brown and pink.

477
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's cheating.

478
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I know.

479
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I have to fight Alva with the professor.

480
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then, he will get mad at the professor.

481
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Then, he will get mad at me.

482
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Then, he will get mad at the professor.

483
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Then, he will be disqualified.

484
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I will win.

485
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What should I do?

486
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What should I do?

487
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You gave it to me.

488
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Why did you put it in my bag?

489
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't know.

490
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Why did you put it in my bag?

491
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't know.

492
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What did I do?

493
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Prof.

494
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Wait.

495
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Prof.

496
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Tommy.

497
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Prof.

498
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There's something I want to tell you about Alva.

499
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What's so important about Alva that you want to tell me?

500
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's very important, Prof.

501
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I assure you.

502
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Prof. Purwa and Prof. Aldebaran...

503
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
will get mad.

504
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Tell me.

505
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What's the matter?

506
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yesterday, during a competition to get Alva's hair...

507
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Alva...

508
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
What's wrong with Alva, Tommy?

509
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Tommy.

510
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Say it.

511
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Alva...

512
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Say it.

513
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What's wrong with Alva?

514
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Why is my voice like this?

515
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I will explain it in sign language.

516
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I remind you, Tommy.

517
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Don't play around.

518
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Al...

519
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Al...

520
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Al...

521
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Al...

522
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Enough!

523
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You're wasting my time.

524
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
If you do this again, you will be punished.

525
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Do you understand?

526
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You're wasting my time.

527
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Why is my voice weird?

528
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Hello?

529
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It turns out that Tommy is here.

530
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hi, handsome.

531
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I have a present for you.

532
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I got it.

533
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Chocolate.

534
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I got chocolate from you.

535
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Why did you reject me?

536
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I know why you rejected me.

537
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Because of your teeth.

538
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Professor Gadil.

539
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Professor Curang.

540
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You helped Alva.

541
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I will tell Alva and you to Professor Aldebaran.

542
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Wait, Tommy.

543
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
While we're waiting, I will show you something.

544
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yes!

545
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Come on, Tommy.

546
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Show me how to play from scratch.

547
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Come on, Tommy.

548
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Tommy.

549
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
First, I have to show you.

550
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Now, I have to show you again?

551
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Think about it, Tommy.

552
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Ah, Papi.

553
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Show me.

554
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you don't show me, I will scream.

555
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Ah!

556
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Don't make noise.

557
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's why I told you.

558
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But...

559
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That's enough.

560
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Don't make noise again.

561
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay.

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Okay, Papi.

563
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Let me tell you.

564
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I brought you two flowers.

565
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And a heart-shaped chocolate.

566
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
If you give it to that girl, they will be happy.

567
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, I see.

568
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yes!

569
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Look, Tommy.

570
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You don't have enough proof.

571
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I gave you flowers and chocolate.

572
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But I showed that picture to Professor Aldebaran.

573
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You will be disqualified, Tommy.

574
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Professor, I'm sorry.

575
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Don't tell Professor Aldebaran, please.

576
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Don't, Professor.

577
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay, Tommy.

578
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I won't tell you.

579
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But you have to stay still.

580
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And we don't have to explain anything.

581
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Just concentrate on the third test.

582
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Okay, handsome?

583
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Darn it.

584
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Isn't that Professor Titan?

585
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Why is he standing in front of the warehouse?

586
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
There he is.

587
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Professor Aldebaran?

588
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Why is he here?

589
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Ouch, it hurts.

590
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Give him a lesson.

591
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Ouch.

592
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Oh, my God.

593
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
My eyes are so scary.

594
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But I'm going to be a witness to Professor Titan.

595
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Maybe he has something to do with the dark wizard.

596
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If he uses a real magic, he will change soon.

597
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We can do it.

598
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We can do it.

599
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What should we do, Pi?

600
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I can't. I always lose.

601
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
If I keep losing, I will be his opponent.

602
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Shh.

603
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Tommy, don't be harsh.

604
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If other people find out, it will be dangerous.

605
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
What about me?

606
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If I don't participate in the competition, it will be hard for Tommy to win.

607
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes, I'm also confused.

608
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Your friend named Alva must be very smart.

609
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You often give him a tip, but he never wins.

610
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
No, Pi. Alva is not smart.

611
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Alva is a wizard.

612
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's why he can't keep losing.

613
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Anyway, Tommy has to win this time.

614
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
If he doesn't win, Tommy will be beaten for a week.

615
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Shh.

616
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Don't do that.

617
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Your friend will be stressed.

618
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That's why Tommy has to win.

619
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So, what's the task for later?

620
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't know.

621
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh.

622
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So, you want Tommy to lose.

623
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's okay.

624
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Tommy will be beaten for eating and drinking.

625
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Don't do that.

626
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But, promise me.

627
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If I tell you the task, you have to win.

628
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Okay.

629
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Okay, I'll tell you.

630
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Huh? Catching a ghost?

631
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Professor Tim.

632
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We're in the dark.

633
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'll be attacked.

634
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'll wake up from my dream.

635
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Why are you laughing?

636
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I think my dream is a clue for me.

637
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Come on, Pegah.

638
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
If it's a dream, it's a dream.

639
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Don't get involved with real life.

640
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes, Pegah.

641
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's a slander.

642
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The professor often gives us lollipops and chocolates.

643
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So many of them.

644
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Hey, listen.

645
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You guys.

646
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Don't trust people.

647
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You have to remember.

648
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Professor Rangkara.

649
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Professor Rangkara?

650
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
He pretended to be nice to us.

651
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Very nice.

652
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But, what did he do?

653
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
He gave us lollipops.

654
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It means he's a genius.

655
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So, I think...

656
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
...Professor Titan has something to do with the dark.

657
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Pegah.

658
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You're exaggerating.

659
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
No one is nice since then.

660
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's a slander.

661
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Professor Titan is nice.

662
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Right, Re?

663
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
If you don't believe me, I'll prove it.

664
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's it.

665
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Good morning, kids.

666
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Good morning, sir.

667
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Why are you guys not excited?

668
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Good morning, kids.

669
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Good morning, sir.

670
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Alright.

671
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Today's lesson is...

672
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
...the history of magic.

673
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Where we're going to learn...

674
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
...about the magic of changing existence...

675
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
...without confusion.

676
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
This magic includes...

677
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
...high level black magic.

678
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And...

679
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
...it's not time to be mastered by you.

680
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What's so great about this magic?

681
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
This magic...

682
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
...can change someone's existence...

683
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
...into someone else's existence.

684
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
What's so great about this magic...

685
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
...apart from changing someone else's existence...

686
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
...but it can also change...

687
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
...the nature of the person.

688
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That's why this magic...

689
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
...is a perfect magic for the person.

690
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And it can last up to a year.

691
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Sir.

692
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Isn't there any weakness in this magic?

693
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
There is.

694
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Of course there's a weakness in this magic.

695
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Then, what is it?

696
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The weakness of this magic is...

697
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Maybe some of you know...

698
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
...what the weakness of this magic is.

699
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Someone has to answer.

700
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Where's Vega?

701
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He usually knows the answer.

702
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Vega, what do you think the answer is?

703
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Look.

704
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Where's Vega?

705
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
He's not here.

706
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
He's not here.

707
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He's not here.

708
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He's not here.

709
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm confused too.

710
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm confused.

711
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's weird that he's not here.

712
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Why did he give up?

713
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Why did he give up?

714
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Because I have to prove that...

715
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
...this kind of illusion is definitely bad.

716
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I have to prove that...

717
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
...this kind of illusion is definitely bad.

718
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
No, no, no, Mika.

719
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Mika, what's wrong?

720
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What's wrong with your face, Professor?

721
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Your face is pale.

722
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Sorry, Professor. I didn't mean to.

723
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
If he uses the illusion...

724
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
...he will definitely change.

725
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
What's wrong?

726
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Vega.

727
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
What are we looking for?

728
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Why are you staring at Professor?

729
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Professor is scared, Vega.

730
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Sorry, Professor.

731
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's okay.

732
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's okay, Professor.

733
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You're smiling.

734
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Professor has a gift for you.

735
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Okay?

736
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You got...

737
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
...a lollipop.

738
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Vega.

739
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
This is a sweet lollipop...

740
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
...for you.

741
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Thank you, Professor.

742
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Let's go, Professor.

743
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
He hasn't changed.

744
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Did I make a mistake?

745
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But, Professor is still not here.

746
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
To be continued...

747
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Enough.

748
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Since Vega is not here...

749
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
...and none of you can answer...

750
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
...the weakness of this mantra...

751
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
...let me tell you.

752
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The weakness of this mantra...

753
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
...is...

754
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
...shining.

755
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Oh, shining.

756
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Why is it called shining, soldier?

757
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
There's a way to change the world...

758
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
...without using magic.

759
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Vega.

760
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Vega.

761
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Vega.

762
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
What?

763
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You're such a good friend, but you didn't come in.

764
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You're such a bad friend.

765
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
The lesson was so fun.

766
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We were taught a changing mantra.

767
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You must be upset that you didn't come in.

768
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Enough. You're so noisy.

769
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm studying. Don't disturb me.

770
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Let's study somewhere else.

771
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So noisy.

772
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That person is so weird.

773
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Maybe he's crazy.

774
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He's so sensitive.

775
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
He's right.

776
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
If it's a girl...

777
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
...she's the most difficult to understand.

778
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
No wonder.

779
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's a girl.

780
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Wait a minute.

781
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What is it?

782
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Can you come to my room after lunch?

783
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The professor will give you a private lesson...

784
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
...for free.

785
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Free.

786
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Do you want to come?

787
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I really want to.

788
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So cute.

789
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
The professor has a gift for you.

790
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's ready.

791
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Chocolate.

792
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
This is chocolate from the professor for you.

793
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And for you.

794
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Thank you, professor.

795
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You're so kind.

796
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Okay.

797
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You're welcome.

798
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What's going on?

799
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
The professor is kidnapped.

800
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
The professor is kidnapped.

801
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Rettor.

802
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Rettor.

803
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
This is your favorite food.

804
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Come out.

805
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Rettor.

806
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
This is your favorite food.

807
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Come on, Rettor.

808
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Don't hide.

809
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Hi, Rettor.

810
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Come out.

811
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Rettor.

812
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Eat as much as you want, Rettor.

813
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But remember, Rettor.

814
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I have a task for you tomorrow.

815
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Come on, eat.

816
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I should have gone to his room.

817
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But the professor is gone.

818
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yes, someone's here.

819
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I'll check the other side.

820
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
What's that?

821
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
What's inside?

822
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Why is it locked?

823
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
What's inside?

824
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'll open it.

825
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'll open it.

826
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Mom.

827
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Someone's at the door.

828
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Alva's here.

829
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
She thinks I'm Professor Titan.

830
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'll just go out.

831
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's better if I don't go out.

832
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
She'll be mad if she finds out I'm stalking her favorite teacher.

833
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Alva saw Mari too.

834
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm sure Alva will be suspicious of Mari.

835
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Be patient, Sentaurus.

836
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You'll be released.

837
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The professor is gone.

838
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Be patient, Sentaurus.

839
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Be patient, Sentaurus.

840
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
There's a child in this room.

841
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I want to tell her.

842
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I know you must be bored in there.

843
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Right?

844
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Be patient.

845
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
You'll be released.

846
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Be patient.

847
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Alva.

848
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Professor.

849
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
What are you doing here?

850
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Professor.

851
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Sentaurus is so noisy.

852
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Maybe he wants to be released.

853
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Maybe he's bored.

854
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Be patient.

855
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Don't worry, Alva.

856
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
The professor will play with Sentaurus.

857
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Now, the professor will cast a spell on you.

858
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
This spell is used to catch ghosts.

859
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Ghosts?

860
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Have you ever seen a ghost?

861
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Are you scared, Alva?

862
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
No. I've seen one.

863
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That's great, Alva.

864
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You can catch ghosts.

865
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I can't, professor.

866
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Ghosts are transparent.

867
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I can only touch them if they're dense.

868
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
That's right, Alva.

869
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That's why the professor will teach you this dense spell.

870
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Okay?

871
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Alva, look at the ghost.

872
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Now, the professor will catch it.

873
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Spell!

874
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Alva, look.

875
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I've caught the ghost.

876
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Now, you can try, Alva.

877
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Alva, look.

878
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm sorry, professor.

879
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I didn't mean to.

880
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I have to be free.

881
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Since there's a kid in this room.

882
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's okay, Alva.

883
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Now, you can try again.

884
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'm sorry, professor.

885
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
He's kind.

886
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
He taught Alva a new spell.

887
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That means I was wrong.

888
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
A, B, C.

889
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
What's that noise?

890
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I did it!

891
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Good, Alva.

892
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You did it.

893
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Thank you, professor.

894
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You're welcome.

895
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Help!

896
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm the real professor.

897
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Help!

898
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'm the real professor.

899
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I'm the real professor.

900
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Let me go.

901
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
A, B, C.

902
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
What's that noise?

903
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I think it's from Titan's room.

904
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I think Titan's professor...

905
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
...is training with Sentaurus.

906
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Oh, right.

907
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I have to go.

908
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Kids.

909
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It's time for the final match...

910
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
...between two contestants.

911
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Alva and Tommy.

912
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Alva!

913
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Calm down, kids.

914
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Alva!

915
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Alva and Tommy.

916
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
You have to ride your bike...

917
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
...into the forest.

918
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
In the forest, you have to catch...

919
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
...a ghost.

920
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Ghost?

921
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's scary.

922
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
After you catch the ghost,

923
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
you have to bring it to the finish line.

924
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
When you get there,

925
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
you have to run...

926
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
...to get the prize.

927
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The first one to get the prize...

928
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
...will be the winner.

929
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Alva and Tommy, are you ready?

930
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yes, sir.

931
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
One.

932
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Two.

933
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Three!

934
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Tommy!

935
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Don't let him catch us.

936
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It's taking too long.

937
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'm on standby.

938
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's a waste of time.

939
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That's it.

940
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
He won't be able to catch me.

941
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm so weak.

942
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
That's Alva.

943
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yes, that's Alva.

944
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
She made me lose my faith in life.

945
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I will make her lose.

946
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Guys,

947
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
you better hide.

948
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Don't show up...

949
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
...in front of Alva's magic school.

950
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Don't we have to show up?

951
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
What should we do?

952
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
One is fine.

953
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But Alva is not.

954
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Is that important?

955
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But...

956
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
No buts.

957
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
We have to catch her.

958
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Don't say buts.

959
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Just follow me.

960
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Don't show up in front of Alva's magic school.

961
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That's it.

962
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Over there.

963
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
You're done, Alva.

964
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You won't get the ghost.

965
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And you will lose.

966
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Alva, I'll go right, you go left.

967
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Let's see who gets the ghost first.

968
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Vega?

969
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Don't you watch the race?

970
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
There's something more important than the race.

971
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
What's that, Vega?

972
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Professor Titan.

973
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
What about him?

974
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Professor Titan...

975
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
...who's been in our school...

976
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
...is a fake.

977
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Bye, Alva.

978
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Don't show up.

979
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
You're done, Alva.

980
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
The ghost is hiding.

981
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You won't get the ghost.

982
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I'm going.

983
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
To be continued...

984
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
To be continued...
