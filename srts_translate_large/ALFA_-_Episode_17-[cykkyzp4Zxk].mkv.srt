00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Be proud of yourself!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go! Go! Go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's no name.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is just a lie.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is a trap.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The Dark Lord just wants my sweat, tears, and blood.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Give me your ring.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're under arrest.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You only have one chance.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you lose the ring.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let me go!

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let me go!

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can't give up Alpha to them.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, it's better...

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
if there's someone among us...

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to disguise as Alpha.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Who?

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Myself.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Who's coming?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
To be continued...

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's going on, Tom?

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why are we gathered here?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I gathered you all on purpose.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want to tell you...

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that Professor Aldebaran was kidnapped by that monster.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Kidnapped?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, we have to save the professor.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And we have to get rid of that monster.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But, how?

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That monster is stronger than a monster.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Calm down.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I know how.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Actually, Alpha is the target.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not the professor.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, if we want to save our professor,

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we have to get rid of Alpha.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's find Alpha now.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where is he?

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Alpha!

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Alpha!

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Vita, have you found Alpha?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Not yet.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's not in the library.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Where is he?

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Have you found Alpha?

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's not in the library either.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Where is he?

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's not in the library either.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Where is he?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Where is he?

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where is Alpha?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's why we have to find him.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I know.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
When we attacked that monster,

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
he was still with us.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But, he's not with us now.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe, Alpha is hiding.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Maybe, he's running away.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Maybe, he's in the library.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Alpha is not that kind of person.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Where is he?

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What should we do?

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's use the kite.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's right.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Cut the kite.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to find Alpha.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going to find Alpha.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm going to find Alpha.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm going to find Alpha.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a ghost.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's really a ghost.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What's wrong?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Alpha was kidnapped by that monster.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He's in the hallway.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What should we do?

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's so scary.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What should we do?

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm so scared.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What should we do?

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's tell the teachers.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I got a lollipop.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm going to save him.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't let him get hurt.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't let him get hurt.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I will help Roger.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I won't let anyone hurt Roger.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Like he hurt my parents first.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Why are you attacking me?

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not attacking you.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm not attacking you.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm not attacking you.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Prof. Ragni.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Prof. Ragni is not here.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Where is Prof. Ragni?

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Gosh.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Gawat.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He's not here.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Gosh, Prof. Ragni is not here.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, Prof. Purwocoki is not here.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Gosh.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What about him?

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yasmin is not here either.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Gosh, what should we do?

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What should we do?

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is weird.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How can they be together?

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you guys doing here?

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We're looking for Prof. Ragni.

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, Prof. Ragni and all teachers are on their way.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Where are they going?

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Long, long, long from here.

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They're going to the place in the dark

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to help Prof. Adebarat.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But we were asked to help Alva.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't worry, be happy.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Megan and Arate have disguised as Alva.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, they went there with a fake Alva.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Isn't it amazing?

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But this is even worse.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then?

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's better if we ask the others to help Alva.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Come on, let's go.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Gosh, these kids.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Wait for me. Don't go.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I have to defeat Barga before we reach the place in the dark.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
To be continued...

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
To be continued...

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Alva is destroyed.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Where is Prof. Adebarat?

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hand him over.

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then, we'll hand him over.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Calm down, all of you.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When my deal with Alva is done,

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Adebarat will be back.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's not the deal.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We'll give you Alva and you'll return Prof. Adebarat.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes, Karan. Prove it.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Be patient, Prof. It's okay.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let me go with them.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Did you hear that?

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Alva is smarter than you.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Enough.

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why are we gathered here?

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We want to ask for your help.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We have to help Alva.

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because she's in danger.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't want to join if it's about defeating Raksasa.

159
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But if you want to help Pegasus,

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
it's up to you.

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't want to join.

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't want to die a loser.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're so ungrateful.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay, let's go.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll go with you.

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Me too.

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What do we do now?

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's so painful.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There are only four of us.

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What if we're defeated by Raksasa?

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're right, Tole.

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We saw that Raksasa can't be defeated.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If we go there,

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we'll lose.

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And we won't help Alva.

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Poor Alva.

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not like that, guys.

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's prepare ourselves first.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then, we'll find out where Raksasa's weakness is.

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's useless to fight her.

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But we don't know her weakness.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Her weakness?

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's better than losing.

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's go to the library.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's go.

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Alva is destroyed.

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Alva is destroyed.

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What's that?

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a ghost.

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Alva is destroyed.

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a ghost.

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We'll succeed this time.

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We'll succeed this time.

194
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We're going to lose.

195
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What do we do?

196
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We're going to lose.

197
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They said that...

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
if we go to the house, we'll be pulled.

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm confused, too.

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why?

201
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We were pulled by Professor Puluak.

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Why is he still strong?

203
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm confused, too.

204
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I haven't seen any other developments.

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's look for it.

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I want to look for other developments.

207
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's go.

208
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's go.

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What's wrong?

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was told that...

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Alva gave up.

212
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It must be in this book.

213
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The hands and feet of the Dark Lord.

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There must be a clue here.

215
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's look for it.

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The Dark Lord has a magical ring.

217
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It can make monsters stronger.

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know how to do it.

219
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Guys!

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What's that noise?

221
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's that noise?

222
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's scary.

223
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's the Dark Lord!

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I have to find his weakness.

225
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's broken!

226
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's broken!

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's broken!

228
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Ouch.

229
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It hurts.

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can't stand up.

231
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What should I do?

232
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's up to you, Alva.

233
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
With your blood, I can perfect your power.

234
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Professor Aliparang.

235
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where is he?

236
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Where's Professor Aliparang?

237
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Shut up!

238
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't talk too much.

239
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Are you ready?

240
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes.

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Let's go.

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's help Alva.

243
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
One, two, three.

244
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's go!

245
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Help!

246
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Help!

247
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Alva!

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You're strong.

249
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Keep going.

250
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hold on, Alva.

251
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you, Plita.

252
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're welcome.

253
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Alva!

254
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Hi, everyone.

255
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Alva!

256
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Hi.

257
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
How did you know I'm here?

258
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I saw you flying.

259
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, I'm used to it.

260
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I want to fly by myself.

261
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No.

262
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We're all worried.

263
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Then, you have no choice.

264
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I stole Professor Aliparang.

265
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Then, I chased him.

266
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you for helping me.

267
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm strong now.

268
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Barga can't be defeated.

269
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Alva, the ring.

270
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Barga's ring has a charm.

271
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
When he wears it, he'll be strong.

272
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So, the charm is from the ring.

273
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Let's make a plan.

274
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But, before that...

275
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Catch it!

276
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You have to eat first.

277
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you eat, your energy will recover.

278
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And your leg won't hurt anymore.

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay.

280
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
My leg won't hurt anymore.

282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're right.

283
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

284
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's make a plan.

285
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay.

286
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Why is it so quiet?

287
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Alva.

288
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Now, I'll take your blood.

289
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay.

290
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Take the blood.

291
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Take it.

292
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Alva.

293
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why are you a follower now?

294
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't know.

295
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe, he's very curious.

296
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Maybe, he's the only one who's curious.

297
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Use your brain.

298
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Take the hair.

299
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you want to take the blood,

300
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
hurry up.

301
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can use the old one.

302
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anggara.

303
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think something's wrong with Alva.

304
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I think,

305
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
she's stressed.

306
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's up to you, Alva.

307
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It doesn't matter.

308
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What matters is the blood.

309
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
With your blood,

310
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I can perfect my power.

311
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Take the blood.

312
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Are you done?

313
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Have fun here, Alva.

314
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, sir.

315
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Alva.

316
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I got you.

317
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You're a traitor.

318
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I feel sorry for you.

319
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Attack.

320
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Attack.

321
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Attack.

322
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Attack.

323
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't hit me.

324
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Rita.

325
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That's him.

326
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Keep an eye on him.

327
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yes, sir.

328
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Be careful, sir.

329
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Dad.

331
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Ouch.

332
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Alva.

333
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Alva.

334
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Are you okay?

335
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm fine.

336
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
His hand is so big.

337
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's hard to get the ring.

338
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What should I do?

339
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I have an idea.

340
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Get the oil.

341
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Here.

342
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Wear this.

343
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I hope it works.

344
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Okay, guys.

345
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Let's attack him.

346
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Let's go.

347
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Attack.

348
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Attack.

349
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Rita.

350
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
He's getting closer.

351
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Let's go.

352
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Alva.

353
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Alva.

354
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Alva.

355
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Be careful, sir.

356
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't.

357
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Help.

358
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm sorry, sir.

359
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Get him.

361
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
To be continued...

362
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Good.

363
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
With Ramwana.

364
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You know how to do everything.

365
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I won't lose.

366
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Why didn't anything happen?

367
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Angara.

368
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Why didn't you tell me, Angara?

369
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't know, sir.

370
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Is Ramwana in the wrong?

371
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I bought a boxer.

372
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm sorry, sir.

373
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm sorry, sir.

374
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm sorry, sir.

375
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm sorry, sir.

376
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I shouldn't have lied to you.

377
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's time.

378
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm going to fight him.

379
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I want Tara.

380
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I can use Tongsis.

381
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I can also use Tongsis.

382
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
This is easy.

383
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Let's go.

384
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's go.

385
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Let's go.

386
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Let's go.

387
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It hurts.

388
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm hungry.

389
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Let's go.

390
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
What do you want to eat?

391
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What do you want to eat?

392
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm hungry.

393
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We're hungry.

394
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Don't you know that?

395
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm hungry.

396
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But I don't want to eat what you want to eat.

397
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Peanuts.

398
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But it's not normal peanuts.

399
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Then?

400
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's a magic peanut.

401
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Don't you remember Prof. Rakmi?

402
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Children.

403
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Now we're going to learn about a magic plant.

404
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's a magic peanut.

405
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
There's a peanut in front of you.

406
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Plant it in the ground.

407
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But be careful.

408
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Don't let it touch the water.

409
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay, ma'am.

410
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
One month later.

411
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Tole.

412
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Help me, Prof.

413
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Tole.

414
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I told you not to let the plant touch the water.

415
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Now look what happened.

416
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm sorry, Prof.

417
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Gosh.

418
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't you remember?

419
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Try to imagine.

420
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You want to eat this peanut.

421
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Then, when you eat it,

422
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
you have to turn around.

423
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Then, you have to turn around and eat it.

424
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That's scary.

425
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I can't do it.

426
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

427
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'll turn around and eat it.

428
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Guys.

429
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I have an idea.

430
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What is it?

431
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
One, two, three.

432
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
One, two, three.

433
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
One, two, three. Peanuts.

434
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Let's get the peanuts.

435
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Let's go.

436
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Peanuts.

437
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Peanuts.

438
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
One, two, three.

439
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm...

440
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
dead.

441
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Guys.

442
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Throw the peanuts.

443
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Let's go.

444
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Guys.

445
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Calculate the distance to the sky.

446
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Get the peanuts.

447
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Get the peanuts.

448
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Get the peanuts.

449
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm...

450
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
dead.

451
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm...

452
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
dead.

453
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm...

454
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
dead.

455
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm...

456
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
dead.

457
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm...

458
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
dead.

459
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm...

460
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
dead.

461
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm...

462
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
dead.

463
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Rika.

464
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Rai.

465
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I fell down.

466
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Rai.

467
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Rika.

468
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Rai.

469
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Help me.

470
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Let's go.

471
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
No!

472
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Mate.

473
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
No!

474
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, Brazil!

475
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, Brazil!

476
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm so happy.

477
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm so happy.

478
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm so happy.

479
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm so happy.

480
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Thank you, friends.

481
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm so happy.

482
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank you, friends.

483
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Now, I'm the champion.

484
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yes, you are.

485
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But, don't.

486
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Run!

487
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm panicking.

488
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Stop it.

489
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Let's go to school.

490
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What are you doing?

491
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Megantara is ours.

492
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And it will be forever.

493
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I feel so small.

494
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
To be continued...

495
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Professor Angkara.

496
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Professor Angkara.

497
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Professor Angkara.

498
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Where is he?

499
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Angkara.

500
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I mean, Professor Angkara.

501
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yes, Professor Angkara.

502
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I was walking.

504
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm so hungry.

505
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
To be continued...

506
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Professor Angkara.

507
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Emotions will never help you.

508
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Are you attacking me?

510
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Why?

511
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You must be scared.

512
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
To be continued...

513
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Take Aldebaran and leave.

514
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
He's in the next room.

515
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Are you serious?

516
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Run!

517
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Before we fight.

518
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Okay, then.

519
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Excuse me.

520
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
To be continued...

521
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You did it.

522
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I don't believe it.

523
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You did it.

524
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's all thanks to Alva.

525
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You guys are awesome.

526
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Alva is awesome.

527
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Alva is awesome.

528
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Alva is awesome.

529
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Alva is awesome.

530
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Oh my God.

531
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh my God.

532
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You brought Professor Aldebaran back here.

533
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's new grip.

534
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You guys are awesome.

535
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Amazing.

536
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I have to tell the other professors.

537
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Professor Aldebaran is back.

538
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Saved by Alva, Vega, Ray, Tole, and Pelita.

539
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
To be continued...

540
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Where's Megantara?

541
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
What took him so long?

542
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
How's Professor Aldebaran?

543
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
There's a letter.

544
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
What is it?

545
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Professor Aldebaran is safe.

546
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
He's saved by Alva, Vega, Tole, Ray, and Pelita.

547
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Thank God.

548
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We were right about them.

549
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
They are now very brave and brave.

550
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes, very good.

551
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Come on.

552
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Let's go back to the school.

553
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Professor Purwa.

554
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
What about Megantara?

555
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Professor Agni.

556
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Since the beginning, Megantara told me...

557
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the most important thing is Professor Aldebaran's safety.

558
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
He can take care of himself.

559
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And now?

560
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
After we've come this far...

561
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
you're just going to leave Megantara like that?

562
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Megantara offered to become Alva.

563
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
He knows the risks.

564
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's right.

565
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And now, Megantara's knowledge is high enough.

566
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And he can take care of himself.

567
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
No.

568
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm not going back.

569
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
If you want to go home, go ahead.

570
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'll wait for you here.

571
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's up to you, Professor Agni.

572
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Goodbye, Nolip.

573
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Goodbye.

574
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
If anything happens, let me know.

575
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes, ma'am.

576
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Mertiwi.

577
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
How is Professor Aldebaran?

578
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It's okay.

579
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Professor Aldebaran will wake up in a few hours.

580
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Good.

581
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Wait.

582
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Why is it just the two of you?

583
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Professor Agni and Megantara?

584
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Where is...

585
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Megantara is now in the Dark Palace.

586
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And Professor Agni is waiting for him to come back.

587
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
What?

588
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Megantara has a place in the Dark Palace?

589
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yes.

590
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He offered to become Alva.

591
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You didn't tell me.

592
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Well, I forgot.

593
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I was thinking about how to fight that monster.

594
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What are you doing?

595
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Megantara is in the Dark Palace.

596
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And he will be defeated by the Dark Lord.

597
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Wait.

598
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Alva is coming.

599
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And this time, don't you dare to come back.

600
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Or Megantara won't forgive you.

601
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I won't let the Dark Lord hurt Tara.

602
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Alva.

603
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Alva.

604
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Alva.

605
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Where are you going?

606
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
What's that?

607
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Mega.

608
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Why are you here?

609
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
What's going on?

610
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Alva heard the words of the bird.

611
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And he wants to attack Tara.

612
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Alva.

613
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
How dare you.

614
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Please, Professor.

615
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Or she will be attacked by the Dark Lord.

616
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Alva.

617
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
What are you doing here?

618
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I want to meet the Dark Lord.

619
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Come back.

620
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Alva.

621
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Don't be stubborn.

622
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You have to go home now.

623
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
No, Professor.

624
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I can't go home.

625
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The army is still in the Dark Lord's territory.

626
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Alva, I order you to go home now.

627
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I can't, Professor.

628
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I don't want anyone to be a victim because of me.

629
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
The Dark Lord.

630
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm here.

631
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Come out.

632
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
The Dark Lord.

633
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
What are you doing, Alva?

634
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I order you to go home now.

635
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Or I will punish you.

636
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Alva.

637
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Go home now.

638
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Or I will kick you out of the school.

639
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I don't want to be kicked out of the school.

640
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I don't want to be kicked out of the school.

641
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I don't want to be kicked out of the school.

642
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I don't want to be kicked out of the school.

643
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I don't want to be kicked out of the school.

644
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
As long as we are safe.

645
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Welcome, Alva.

646
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Kara.

647
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Kara.

648
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
What have you done?

649
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It turns out that this is true, Alva.

650
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
If you don't come with me now, Alva.

651
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
No, Alva.

652
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You can't go.

653
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But, Professor.

654
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I can take care of myself.

655
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
No, Alva.

656
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You have to stay here, Alva.

657
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Let me go, Alva.

658
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
No, Kara.

659
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's better for me if you go.

660
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You are useless.

661
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Let me go, Alva.

662
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No.

663
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I won't let you go, Alva.

664
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Alva!

665
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Alva!

666
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
David, no!

667
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We can do this.

668
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
We can do this.

669
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Tara.

670
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Tantara.

671
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Tantara, wake up.

672
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Tantara.

673
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Tantara.

674
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Tantara, wake up.

675
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Tantara, let's get out of here.

676
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Tantara.

677
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Tantara.

678
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Alva.

679
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Alva.

680
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Good, Megantara.

681
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Good.

682
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Professor Kara.

683
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
What are you doing, Tantara?

684
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Why?

685
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You must not believe...

686
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
...that Megantara...

687
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
...is my son.

688
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
My son?

689
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Megantara.

690
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Now, you will take my son's blood.

691
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Don't, Tantara.

692
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Don't, Tantara.

693
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Take the boy's blood.

694
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Attack him, Alva.

695
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Attack him.

696
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
David, no!

697
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
One, two, three.

698
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Two, three.

699
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Megantara.

700
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Megantara.

701
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Megantara.

702
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yes!

703
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Megantara.

704
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I hypnotized you.

705
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Angkara.

706
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You won't fall for the second time.

707
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Professor Agni.

708
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You were hypnotized.

709
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Doctor Pertiwi.

710
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You were hypnotized.

711
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But I, Megantara...

712
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
...can't hypnotize you.

713
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
MEGANTARA

714
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
MEGANTARA

715
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
MEGANTARA

716
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
MEGANTARA

717
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
MEGANTARA

718
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
MEGANTARA

719
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
This hypnotism is very dangerous for you, Megantara.

720
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You must be very careful.

721
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That's right.

722
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
If Megantara finds out...

723
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
...she will be hypnotized.

724
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And she will become their spy.

725
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
How about we learn...

726
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
...the anti-hypnotism mantra?

727
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Agreed.

728
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Let's go.

729
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Memorize the anti-hypnotism mantra.

730
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And I'll hypnotize you.

731
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
MEGANTARA

732
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
MEGANTARA

733
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
MEGANTARA

734
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
MEGANTARA

735
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
MEGANTARA

736
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
MEGANTARA

737
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
MEGANTARA

738
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
How is it?

739
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I think the anti-hypnotism mantra didn't work.

740
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I think so.

741
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Finally.

742
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Professor Agni is back.

743
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Finally.

744
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Just like that.

745
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Now you, Megantara.

746
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Me? Hypnotized?

747
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yes.

748
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Who's afraid?

749
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Try it.

750
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Megantara.

751
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Megantara.

752
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Megantara.

753
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Finally.

754
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Finally what?

755
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
It worked.

756
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
The servant lifted the stone.

757
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You got a lot of money.

758
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You're all fooled.

759
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You're so unlucky.

760
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Angkara.

761
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You're a cunning human.

762
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
A cunning human like you...

763
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
...must be faced in a way that is no less cunning.

764
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Okay, Megantara.

765
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Let's attack.

766
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
What?

767
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Now it's time...

768
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
...to destroy him.

769
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Let's go.

770
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Divide!

771
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Get ready, Alva.

772
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
He'll wake up again.

773
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Get ready.

774
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Get ready.

775
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I haven't lost yet.

776
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I haven't lost yet.

777
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I haven't lost yet.

778
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I haven't lost yet.

779
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yes!

780
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yes, I won!

781
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I won!

782
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
We must not make a mistake.

783
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
We must check...

784
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
...whether he's unconscious...

785
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
...dead...

786
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
...or not.

787
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Don't pretend.

788
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'm sorry.

789
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I know...

790
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
...how to find out...

791
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
...whether he's unconscious or not.

792
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Look.

793
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Where is he?

794
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Where is he?

795
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
He's not here.

796
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
He's dead.

797
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yes!

798
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yes!

799
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
A great army...

800
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
...can fight Professor Anggara's hypnotism.

801
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Alva.

802
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
This is all because of you.

803
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Because of me?

804
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yes.

805
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I...

806
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
...can control hypnotism.

807
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
That's because I have the confidence...

808
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
...and determination to save you.

809
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Because of that confidence...

810
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
...that's why we succeeded.

811
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Because I don't want...

812
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
...anyone to harm you, Alva.

813
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Because you...

814
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
...are my beloved student, Alva.

815
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Thank you, General.

816
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Oh, right.

817
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Later, teach me hypnotism, okay?

818
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You want to be able to hypnotize?

819
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
For you...

820
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
...what do I give you?

821
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Don't even think about hypnotizing.

822
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Hypnotizing you to fart...

823
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
...hypnotizing you to fart.

824
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'll definitely give you something.

825
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Later, I can do it.

826
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You!

827
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It's better...

828
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
...if we get out of here quickly.

829
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Let's go.

830
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Wait.

831
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
What now?

832
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Let's run.

833
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Hurry up.

834
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Hurry up.

835
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
My backpack.

836
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Your backpack is empty.

837
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You're a coward.

838
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You should run while carrying your backpack.

839
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
You're a coward.

840
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
But it's okay.

841
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Let's go.

842
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Hypnotizing.

843
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
100.

844
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
3.

845
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Alva.

846
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I won't let you go, Alva.

847
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Wait, sir.

848
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Wait.

849
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Wait, sir.

850
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Poor Alva.

851
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes, you're right.

852
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So, you don't want to come with us?

853
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
No.

854
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
If I'm wrong, I'll forget.

855
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Professor, I fainted.

856
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I was attacked by darkness.

857
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I'm very hurt.

858
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Alva.

859
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
To be continued...

860
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
To be continued...

861
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
To be continued...
