1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your power is not comparable to mine.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Come with me.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let me go!

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're evil!

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The source of the power of Putri Bintang is at night.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You can burn with its light.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So, we'll wait until tomorrow.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tomorrow morning, I'll get the power of Putri Bintang.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, it's true.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Putri Bintang fell down in our school.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I asked him to stay at the school's tower.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But because of the attack,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
he was kidnapped.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We have to go there immediately.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Before Angkara takes the power of Putri Bintang.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, it's time for me to take the heart of Putri Bintang.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Putri Bintang

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll kill you.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's go!

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Get out!

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Get out!

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It turns out that he's behind all of this.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He wants to take Selena's heart.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have to stop him.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Putri Bintang

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Putri Bintang

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Putri Bintang

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Putri Bintang

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Putri Bintang

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Putri Bintang

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Putri Bintang

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Putri Bintang

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Putri Bintang

44
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Putri Bintang

45
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Putri Bintang

46
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Putri Bintang

47
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Fine.

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you don't want to come out,

49
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll force you to come out.

50
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you doing?

51
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Putri Bintang

52
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Putri Bintang

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wake up, Putri Bintang.

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Putri Bintang

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Wake up.

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You have to get out of here.

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Putri Bintang

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Putri Bintang, wake up.

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You have to get out of here.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Putri Bintang

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Putri Bintang

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Putri Bintang, wake up.

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Alva, I'm sorry.

64
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But we have to get out of here.

65
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Putri Bintang

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Alva, my hair.

67
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
My hair is cut.

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, your eyelashes are also squeezed.

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Putri Bintang

70
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Putri Bintang

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Putri Bintang

72
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Putri Bintang

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's what you'll see.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You'll see the real Putri Bintang.

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Putri Bintang

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Alva

77
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Alva

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Alva

79
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Alva

80
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have to drink the eye and hair water from Bintang Jatuh now

81
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
After that, I will be a hero

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Alva, you have to wake her up

83
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't let her drink the eye and hair water

84
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because it can cure all her diseases

85
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And she will be stronger

86
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Bintang Jatuh

87
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There's an eye!

88
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not that easy

89
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's just a distraction

90
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Give me the eye and hair water

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I got it

92
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Bintang Jatuh

93
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Alva

94
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Alva

95
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Alva

96
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don, Alva

97
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Give me the eye and hair water

98
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Bintang Jatuh

99
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Alva, Alva

100
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Alva, Jun!

101
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you waiting for?

102
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm stronger now

103
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your eye and hair water will never hurt me

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Alva, Jun!

105
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now, it's time for me to take Putri Bintang's heart

106
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
With my power

107
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
My power is limitless

108
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Putri Bintang

109
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Alva

110
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Jun

111
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Alva

112
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Jun

113
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Alva

114
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Jun

115
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Alva

116
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Jun

117
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Alva

118
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Jun

119
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Alva

120
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Jun

121
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Alva

122
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Jun

123
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Alva

124
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Jun

125
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Alva

126
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Jun

127
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Alva

128
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Jun

129
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Alva

130
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to find a way to differentiate the real and cloned Ankara

131
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What is that?

132
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ankara

133
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Megantara

134
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The cloned Ankara will never appear in the mirror

135
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Once we see the real Ankara

136
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We attack together

137
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Behind the mirror

138
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Alva

139
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Jun

140
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Alva

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Megantara

142
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The cloned Ankara

143
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Will never appear in the mirror

144
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Lantana

145
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Megantara

146
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The cloned Ankara

147
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Will never appear in the mirror

148
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Megantara

149
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Megantara

150
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Megantara

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The cloned Ankara

152
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The cloned Ankara

153
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Megantara

154
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Megantara

155
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Let's go

156
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's find Alva

157
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's go

158
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Please

159
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Please, Daniel

160
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I want to go back

161
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Please

162
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm not the same

163
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
To be a great

164
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Knight in Jakarta

165
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Stop

166
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Alva

167
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What is this?

168
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
My skin is peeling

169
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Alva

170
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Where are you, Alva?

171
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We have to get out of here

172
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Professor

173
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Soldier

174
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Alva

175
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Alva

176
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Did you meet the fallen star?

177
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, professor

178
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's get out of here

179
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait, soldier

180
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We have to find Jeb

181
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because the dark energy is getting stronger

182
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He managed to cut Serena's hair

183
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And he managed to clean Serena's tears

184
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's okay

185
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's get out of here

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's go

187
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Alva

188
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We're here

189
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Thank you, Alva

190
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You kept your promise

191
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So I can go back to space

192
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Thank you, Megantara

193
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Thank you for your help

194
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Goodbye, Alva

195
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't forget to send my regards

196
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
To Vega, Ray, and Plita

197
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm so happy to meet you

198
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Goodbye

199
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll reach you

200
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Let's go back to school

201
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Let's go

202
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Alva

203
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Alva

204
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Professor Alebaran is hurt

205
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Take him to the school

206
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll face this darkness

207
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Let's go

208
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hurry, Alva

209
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's go

210
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What's wrong with him?

211
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't know

212
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's go, Alva

213
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Alva, watch out!

214
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He's after you!

215
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't let him get away!

216
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Professor!

217
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Professor!

218
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Professor!

219
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's useless to fight

220
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You'll never win

221
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Alva, let's go!

222
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Alva, let's go!

223
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
We have to attack again

224
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Good!

225
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Vega, Ray, and Plita

226
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Attack!

227
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Alva!

228
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Alva!

229
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Alva!

230
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Alva!

231
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Alva!

232
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Alva!

233
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Alva!

234
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Alva!

235
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Alva!

236
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Attack!

237
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What do we do now, Professor?

238
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What do we do?

239
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't worry

240
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There's an important task

241
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
For you

242
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What task, Tentara?

243
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Ready

244
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's go!

245
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
To the right!

246
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Professor!

247
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What's wrong?

248
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Professor Odebaran!

249
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Professor Odebaran!

250
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What's wrong with him?

251
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He looks very bad

252
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He was attacked

253
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We have to take him to the clinic

254
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's go

255
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We have to check him

256
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's go

257
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Run!

258
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Professor!

259
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Professor!

260
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Professor!

261
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's go to the clinic

262
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hurry!

263
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Run!

264
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Run!

265
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Run!

266
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Anggaro!

267
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's like the voice of the God

268
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Anggaro!

269
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm coming, Sir!

270
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Professor!

271
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Professor!

272
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Professor!

273
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Professor!

274
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hang on, Sir!

275
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This is bad

276
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Looks like Professor Odebaran

277
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Can't walk anymore

278
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Vega, prepare the pole

279
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes, Sir

280
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Ready

281
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's go!

282
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Turbofan!

283
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Anggaro!

284
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Anggaro!

285
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Go shit yourself, Professor Odebaran!

286
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Anggaro!

287
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Anggaro!

288
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Anggaro!

289
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Professor Odebaran!

290
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
My daughter...

291
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Professor Odebaran!

292
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
My daughter...

293
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
OOOOooo

294
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
zosty Vape!

295
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Very well, Sir!

296
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't piss you off because of that!

297
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Sir!

298
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What happened, Sir?

299
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The Tributan is back to normal.

300
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But I managed to locate Odebaran.

301
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm sure...

302
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
he's going to die soon.

303
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I have a task for you.

304
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yes, Sir.

305
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'll do it.

306
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Professor Odebaran?

307
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What happened?

308
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes, Sir.

309
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I understand, Sir.

310
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Let's go, Sir.

311
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What is that?

312
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What is that light?

313
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
OMG!

314
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Amazing!

315
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is Centurion Mushroom.

316
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Centurion Mushroom is very rare.

317
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It can cure all diseases.

318
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, diseases!

319
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But why is it here?

320
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Isn't it in Kutub?

321
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Whatever.

322
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh!

323
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's moving!

324
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Hey, Centurion Mushroom!

325
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Don't go!

326
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Don't go with me!

327
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It disappeared.

328
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, no!

329
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hello, Ibu.

330
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I have a request for you.

331
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And you have to do as I command.

332
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yes, sir.

333
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Damn it!

334
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hurry up and do it!

335
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yes, sir.

336
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Professor Lodebaran!

337
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let's go!

338
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Don't leave me!

339
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't leave me!

340
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Professor Lodebaran?

341
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Professor Lodebaran?

342
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What happened?

343
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Professor Lodebaran was attacked.

344
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Professor Lodebaran has a very high level of knowledge.

345
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And if someone can defeat him,

346
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
it means that person has a very high level of knowledge.

347
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We'll talk about that later.

348
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Now we have to treat Professor Lodebaran.

349
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Let's go.

350
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's take him to the clinic.

351
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Professor Lodebaran

352
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Professor Lodebaran

353
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Professor Lodebaran

354
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Professor Lodebaran

355
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Professor Lodebaran

356
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Where is Professor Pertiwi?

357
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He's not here.

358
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He's eating his own food.

359
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
When he's angry,

360
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Pertiwi goes crazy.

361
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay, let me look for him.

362
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Pertiwi, where are you from?

363
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Oh my God!

364
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Professor Lodebaran, I've been waiting for you.

365
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Why?

366
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Don't ask too many questions.

367
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Immediately perform a healing action on Professor Lodebaran.

368
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh my God!

369
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This wound is very bad.

370
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Very, very bad.

371
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And it must be treated immediately with energy transfer.

372
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Pedang Keramat Purnama.

373
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Huh?

374
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Pedang Keramat Purnama?

375
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, where is Pedang Keramat Purnama?

376
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Alva,

377
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Pedang Keramat Purnama

378
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is in an old castle in the forest at the end of the school.

379
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Tell Alva to take Pedang Pusaka Purnama.

380
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Remember,

381
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
only Alva herself.

382
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No teacher can accompany her.

383
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Do you understand?

384
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Alva,

385
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
you better look for him

386
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
so that Professor Lodebaran can be treated immediately.

387
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Alva,

388
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Pedang Keramat Purnama is a very dangerous place.

389
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
There are many traps there.

390
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me go.

391
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Don!

392
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Don't go!

393
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You teachers have to stay here.

394
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Meditate.

395
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Alright.

396
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If so,

397
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'll go.

398
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Don't hold a gun.

399
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You have to stay here.

400
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Alright.

401
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Let's go.

402
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's go too.

403
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Alva.

404
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Professor Lodebaran.

405
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Alva,

406
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
don't go.

407
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But, Professor...

408
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
No, sir.

409
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You don't have to go.

410
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's dangerous for the guest.

411
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Hold on, Rey.

412
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
If so, let me teach you a mantra to ask for help.

413
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No need, Prof.

414
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I already know.

415
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
When I was kidnapped in the cave...

416
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That's enough.

417
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So,

418
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
we're going just the two of us.

419
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There's one!

420
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
There's one!

421
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Where is it?

422
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Here.

423
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Let's go.

424
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Hurry.

425
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
To be continued...

426
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
To be continued...

427
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Where is it?

428
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That must be it.

429
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Hurry.

430
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's go there.

431
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Let's go.

432
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Why are they coming?

433
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Why not Alva?

434
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Alva should be there.

435
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The Fatal Centurion!

436
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What should I do, sir?

437
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Stop those kids.

438
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't let them in.

439
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What are you doing?

440
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That's...

441
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's...

442
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You've never read a book, right?

443
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's Centaurus.

444
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes, this is Centaurus.

445
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let's go.

446
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Be careful.

447
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Come here.

448
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Ouch.

449
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Run.

450
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Run.

451
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Run.

452
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Run.

453
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Run.

454
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Run.

455
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Run.

456
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Run.

457
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Where is it?

458
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's scratched again.

459
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What should we do?

460
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Help me.

461
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Hurry up.

462
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
To be continued...

463
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
To be continued...

464
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
To be continued...

465
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Help me.

466
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
My body is aching.

467
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Help me.

468
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Help me.

469
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
To be continued...

470
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Now, you have to distract him.

471
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I want to read the book.

472
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
How do we distract him?

473
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
How do we do that?

474
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Let's go.

475
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Let's go.

476
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Let's go.

477
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Let's go.

478
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Where is it?

479
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Let's go.

480
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Help me.

481
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm tired.

482
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Help me.

483
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Help me.

484
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm tired.

485
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm tired.

486
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Help me.

487
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm tired.

488
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Have you finished the ice cream?

489
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I haven't eaten yet.

490
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
�

491
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The help of saving all.

492
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Quickly.

493
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Hurry up.

494
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Be patient.

495
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This is it.

496
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I know how to deal with the centaur.

497
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's over.

498
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes.

499
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Centaur, come here.

500
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I dare you to attack me.

501
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Come here.

502
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Come here, you ugly centaur.

503
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Come here to fight me.

504
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Take a photo, Centaur.

505
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yes.

506
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's delicious.

507
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Hurray.

508
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Come here.

509
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It hurts.

510
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Hurray.

511
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You stupid centaur.

512
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You make the children regret.

513
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You're finished, white tiger.

514
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Destroy them all.

515
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yes.

516
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Hurry up.

517
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes.

518
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We have to find the sacred sword.

519
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So, the professor will recover soon.

520
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes.

521
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Let's go.

522
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What kind of castle is this?

523
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's a forest.

524
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
There are animals everywhere.

525
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's hard.

526
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Come here.

527
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Now, you have to distract him.

528
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So, I can read the book.

529
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
How do we distract him?

530
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
We'll be a burden.

531
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
They think we're worms.

532
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't know.

533
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Don't talk too much.

534
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Don't you want the professor to recover?

535
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yes.

536
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Eat this.

537
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's my meat.

538
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's the best.

539
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Where is it?

540
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
There it is.

541
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Help me.

542
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Where is it?

543
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Help me.

544
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes, we did it.

545
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Come here.

546
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Come here.

547
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Come here.

548
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Hurry up.

549
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Come on.

550
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Hurry up.

551
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Men are always like this.

552
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
There's no other way.

553
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Do you have another way?

554
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
If you do, follow me.

555
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Hurry up.

556
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Follow me.

557
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Come on.

558
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Hurry up.

559
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Follow me.

560
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Hurry up.

561
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Follow me.

562
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Where are you going?

563
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
We can do it.

564
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We can do it.

565
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We can do it.

566
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Fire.

567
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yes.

568
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
We did it.

569
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
All of my monsters are destroyed.

570
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
My children are too smart.

571
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I have to make a stronger monster.

572
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Davatambarga.

573
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I am...

574
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
...Batman.

575
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Destroy them all.

576
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Don't let them enter the castle.

577
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I am...

578
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
...Batman.

579
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I am...

580
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
...Batman.

581
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
This time...

582
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
...they're all going to be destroyed.

583
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Rey, Tole.

584
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Rey, Tole, wake up.

585
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Rey, Tole, wake up.

586
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
What should we do?

587
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Rey, wake up.

588
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Monsters.

589
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
What should we do?

590
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Hit them.

591
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Hit them.

592
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I am...

593
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
...Batman.

594
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I am...

595
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
...Batman.

596
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I am...

597
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
...Batman.

598
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I am...

599
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
...Batman.

600
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I am...

601
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
...Batman.

602
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It hurts.

603
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I can't run anymore.

604
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I need help.

605
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's a trap.

606
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Help me.

607
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Professor Ragnik.

608
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Hold on.

609
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You have to get out.

610
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Let's go.

611
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
We have to hold on.

612
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
We have to stick together.

613
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Don't let the energy transfer go.

614
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Because it's dangerous.

615
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Good evening, Professor.

617
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Good evening, Frita.

618
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I asked Koki...

619
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
...to cook for you.

620
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Koki said this food...

621
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
...can restore your powers.

622
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But how do we eat it, Frita?

623
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I can't let go of this.

624
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I'll help you, Professor.

625
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Let's go, Frita.

626
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Give him a big meal.

627
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I'm hungry.

628
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I'm hungry.

629
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'm hungry.

630
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm hungry.

631
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It hurts.

632
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It hurts.

633
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Where's the resumaton?

634
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm worried.

635
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I can't walk.

636
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I can't do anything.

637
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Where is it?

638
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
They failed.

639
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I have to help them.

640
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I can't move.

641
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I can't.

642
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'm...

643
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm hungry.

644
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Calm down.

645
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I'll give you food.

646
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
There are three of you.

647
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm...

648
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
...Megantara's friend.

649
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Yes.

650
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Megantara.

651
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I need...

652
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
...your help.

653
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
May I?

654
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Hey!

655
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Let me go.

656
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Vega.

657
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Vega, wake up.

658
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Vega, wake up.

659
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Vega, wake up.

660
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Vega, wake up.

661
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Where's Rey and Tole?

662
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Rey and Tole are over there.

663
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Rey, Tole.

664
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Rey, Tole.

665
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Rey, wake up.

666
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Rey, Tole.

667
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Rey, wake up.

668
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Rey, wake up.

669
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm here.

670
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Let's go home.

671
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Rey, I'll help you.

672
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Let's go.

673
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'll help you.

674
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Let's go home.

675
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Why do we have to go home?

676
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You have to go home.

677
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
No.

678
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I don't want you to be a victim.

679
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't want to leave you.

680
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Naga.

681
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Take them to school.

682
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Good, Alma.

683
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Get closer.

684
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Finally.

685
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
The special kid is here.

686
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
You're showing your true power, Alva.

687
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Alva.

688
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The poster.

689
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Why did he let them know the way?

690
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Vega said...

691
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
the poster is dangerous.

692
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
But I don't think it's dangerous.

693
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Or maybe it's a trap.

694
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Let's try.

695
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Alva.

696
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Why did you bring me here?

697
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm leaving.

698
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I want to see...

699
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Alva.

700
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Remember?

701
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yes.

702
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I remember, Alva.

703
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Let me go.

704
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Let me go.

705
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Where are you taking me?

706
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Let me go.

707
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Let me go.

708
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I...

709
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
want to remember...

710
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Alva.

711
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
What is he trying to do?

712
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Why does he want to remember me?

713
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Where are you going?

714
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Let me go.

715
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yesterday, I found the power of the fallen star.

716
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And now...

717
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I will get the power of the chosen one.

718
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
With that, I will be a great warrior.

719
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And my power is limitless.

720
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Anggar.

721
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's up to you.

722
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
All I want is...

723
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
to destroy Albara.

724
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
To be continued...

725
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
To be continued...

726
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Alva.

727
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Ray.

728
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Help me.

729
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It's okay, Pram.

730
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's okay.

731
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
You guys eat first.

732
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Let me feed you.

733
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
So your power can be restored.

734
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
To be continued...

735
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Now, it's your turn, Naga.

736
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Now, it's your turn, Naga.

737
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Eat this, Naga.

738
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Vega.

739
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Ray.

740
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yes, Ray.

741
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Have you found the sword?

742
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Not yet, Pram.

743
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Now, what is wrong with the sword?

744
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Alva.

745
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
She is forbidden to go there by Professor Nefara.

746
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Forbidden or not,

747
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
they will meet.

748
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
But, Professor Nefara...

749
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
That is their destiny.

750
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
If the dark lord...

751
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
will capture and destroy Alva.

752
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
What should we do?

753
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Oh no.

754
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
My friends.

755
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I will finish them.

756
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I am the head of the school.

757
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Alubaran.

758
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But, don't worry.

759
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Because I will infuse Alubaran.

760
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I will help you.

761
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Just...

762
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What I will infuse is not poison.

763
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But, poison.

764
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
What?

765
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Poison?

766
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Alva.

767
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Soon, the true power of the dark lord...

768
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
will rise again.

769
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's all because of you, Alva.

770
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
For the safety of Professor Adebari,

771
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I will enchant this door.

772
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So, only the teacher can enter.

773
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Good idea, Professor Purwa.

774
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Good.

775
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
No.

776
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I will not give up.

777
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
To be continued...

778
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Don't ever stop...

779
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Go, go, go...

780
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Fight with the power of your heart...

781
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Go, go, go...

782
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Make yourself proud...

783
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Go, go, go...

784
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Let's dream...

785
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
