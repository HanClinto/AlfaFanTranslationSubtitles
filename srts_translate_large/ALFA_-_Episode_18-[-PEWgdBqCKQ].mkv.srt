1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Watch out!

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Go, go, go!

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah! I did it!

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Angkara, did you see that?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There's Alpha over there.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Does that mean he's with us?

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, you're Megatron.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You'd better go.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let go of Alpha!

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I won't let go of Alpha.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Alpha!

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Attack him, Alpha.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now!

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's attack him!

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's go, Megatron.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One, two, three!

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah!

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Angkara was defeated.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now, it's just me.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah!

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Alpha.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I won't let you go.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The door is locked.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It must be a snake from the dark lab.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Calm down, Alpha.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Open the door.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Try it, Alpha.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Open the door!

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't breathe.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's chant together.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not that easy to get out of here.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I won't let you leave just like that.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is...

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Vira!

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Mother!

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Now, I'm getting stronger.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Both of you...

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
won't be able to take me.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And you...

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Megantron.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because you're looking for trouble with me.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why did you want to kill me first?

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Poor Megantron.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's fight!

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't, Alpha!

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Back off!

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Back off!

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't!

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me face you.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Back off!

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Son of a bitch!

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You, too!

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can't.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's okay, Alpha.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't be afraid.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't, Alpha!

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So, we have to fight the dark lab, right?

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We have to help Alpha.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The dark lab is really strong.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yo!

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The dark lab...

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is not a bungee jump like us.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We can do it.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We can be a parachute.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm scared.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But, I feel sorry for Alpha.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, you're right.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, do you want to join us?

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll join you.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Wait, wait.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to join, too.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I want to join, too.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wait, wait.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're alone in the dark lab.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Be careful.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want to join, too.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to help Alpha.

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to be a hero, too.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, you want to join us.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Xixi!

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't breathe.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Alpha, it's better to help Megantara now.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let me face our next challenge.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, Prof.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Be careful, Prof.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She's very strong.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sephera!

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Sephera!

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Professor is still injured.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't attack her!

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't worry.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I have never lost.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Professor!

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wake up, Professor!

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wake up, Professor!

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Megantara, wake up!

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Wake up, Professor!

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why am I here?

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Amazing!

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Professor Aldebaran is awake!

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thank God!

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm so happy!

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Professor Aldebaran,

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
forget

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Professor Tengsan

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
was attacked by the Dark Knight.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm very, very badly injured.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Alpha!

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Where's Alpha?

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Alpha and Megantara

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
are still at the Dark Knight's place, Prof.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Where are the teachers?

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The teachers?

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The teachers?

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go away, Prof!

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They want to help Alpha and Megantara.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're a villain!

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're a villain!

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is the fate of those who oppose you.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you will have the same fate as them.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're a villain!

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're a villain!

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're a villain!

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You're a villain!

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why is Alpha so strong now?

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My attack can turn him back.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you want, Alpha?

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Answer me, Alpha!

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is Cici, isn't it, Barga?

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you want to throw it away?

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't, Alpha!

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Who knows it might be useful to you.

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, you better keep it.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's throw it away together.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alpha, return the ring, Alpha!

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No.

155
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Whoever wears this ring,

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
he will be defeated.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I will wear it,

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
just like Barga.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't, Alpha!

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't, Alpha!

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Return the ring, Alpha!

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Now, it's your turn.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The people with the key,

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
will you return it?

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Destroy them!

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Destroy them all!

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Down with the viles!

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And east!

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And this is for the army!

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Pegasus!

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Kill him!

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Attack him!

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The Dark Lord is defeated by Alva!

174
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you, bird!

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You've saved me,

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ivi-Lang!

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sorry, Ivi-Lang.

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry, Ivi-Lang.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sorry, Ivi-Lang.

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry, Ivi-Lang.

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry, Ivi-Lang.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The Dark Lord is defeated by Alva!

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Army!

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Wake up!

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wake up, Professor!

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Army!

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's go.

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's go.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We'll open the door together.

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's go.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Open the door.

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Army!

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Army!

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What?

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What happened?

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What's going on?

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The army of the Dark Lord was attacked by the Dark Lord.

198
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Terrible.

199
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The Dark Lord is dead.

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Professor Agni, too.

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
His heart stopped.

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Professor, get out.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Professor!

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Professor!

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Are you okay?

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm okay.

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm okay.

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's go.

209
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's go.

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Let's go.

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's go.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Professor Agni, too.

213
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's go.

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Professor Agni.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank God.

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Professor Agni.

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You've recovered.

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can recover because of your help.

219
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you.

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Alva.

221
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where is the Dark Lord?

222
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Tell me, where is he?

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've defeated him.

224
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know where he is.

225
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're great, Alva.

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're great, Alva.

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's because of the army.

228
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because I have a strong identity.

229
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I won't let the Dark Lord hurt my teachers.

230
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you, Alva.

231
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's go.

232
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We have to go in.

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We have to help Alva.

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's go.

235
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Alva.

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Alva.

237
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Alva, are you okay?

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes!

239
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
One, two, three.

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Three, two, two, three.

241
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That means...

242
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't be a warrior anymore.

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't be a warrior anymore.

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't be a warrior anymore.

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't be a warrior anymore.

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That means...

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I can't be a warrior anymore.

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You can be a warrior.

249
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What kind of warrior?

250
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The Dark Lord.

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Everyone, gather.

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Announcement, announcement.

253
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All students are required to go to class.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Now.

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What is it?

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is there another attack?

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes.

258
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm bored.

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you know?

260
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Men's war.

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Men's war.

262
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
No.

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This time, we won't have a war.

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We will welcome a new professor.

265
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Who will teach in our school.

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, a new professor.

267
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
His name is Professor Tita.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He is a great person.

269
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Very powerful.

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's why Professor Aldebaran sent us to the classroom.

271
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Let's go.

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Who is it?

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's early in the morning.

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Disturbing Professor Tita.

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Why is it like this?

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't know.

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Please.

278
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You're just playing around.

279
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's go back.

280
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's right.

281
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's go back.

282
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's go.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's go.

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's go.

285
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's go.

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's go.

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's go back.

288
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's right.

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's go back.

290
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's go.

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It turns out...

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
My mantra is not perfect.

294
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
When I'm in front of the mirror, my face doesn't change.

295
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I can't be like this.

296
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Come on.

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Open your eyes.

298
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Please.

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Hi, bro.

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
How are you, Professor Lebaran?

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry, Professor. Welcome.

302
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You called me Professor Salah.

303
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He's called Professor Aldebaran.

304
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's right.

305
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I thought I made a mistake.

307
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's okay.

308
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, yes.

310
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I remember.

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think your name is...

312
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Mega...

313
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Megaloman?

314
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's right.

315
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Wrong.

316
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Mega...

318
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm Megantar.

320
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

321
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Can I bring a pan?

322
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Sure.

323
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There's an ant...

324
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
in your food.

325
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You're fat.

326
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But, I'm also fat.

327
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's right.

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's right, Professor.

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's right.

330
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I can imagine how big the ant is.

331
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Professor Titan.

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Welcome to your school.

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Welcome, Professor Aldebaran.

334
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Let me introduce you.

335
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Professor...

336
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What's your name?

337
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm Agni.

338
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Agni?

339
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Professor Titan.

340
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You should come to my house.

341
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Okay.

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So, you can introduce yourself to the kids.

343
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Thank you.

344
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Let Megantar bring the gift.

345
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Thank you, Professor Aldebaran.

346
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Let's go.

347
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay.

348
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Megantar.

349
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Do you need help?

350
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
No.

351
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But, I have to do this.

352
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm still strong.

353
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm old.

354
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Congratulations, Megantar.

355
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Good morning, kids.

356
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Good morning, Sir.

357
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Today, I'm going to introduce you...

358
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to a new teacher.

359
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
His name is Professor Titan.

360
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Please, Professor.

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Good morning, kids.

362
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Good morning, Sir.

363
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Blue Pujan!

364
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Chocolate!

365
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Chocolate.

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Thank you, Professor.

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Kids.

368
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Kids.

369
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Listen.

370
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I have another important announcement.

371
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Our school...

372
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
will hold a magic tournament...

373
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
that will compete...

374
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
for a very exclusive magic trophy.

375
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's going to be fun, right?

376
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's going to be fun, right?

377
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes.

378
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's going to be fun.

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I want to join.

380
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yes.

381
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I want to join too.

382
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I often do magic tricks.

383
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm sure I'm going to win.

384
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Because I've practiced a lot.

385
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's right.

386
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We've practiced too.

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Kids.

388

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
at the school's school.

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Kids.

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This tournament will only be held...

392
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
by two students from Purnawa...

393
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and two students from Jogja.

394
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
There are so many of them, Sir.

395
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There are three of them, Sir.

396
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
There are three of us, Sir.

397
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It can't be just two of us, Sir.

398
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000

404
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000

406
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000

413
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
6th Place

414
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh no

415
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
This box

416
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
There are really 6 of them

417
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So big

418
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So heavy

419
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So tired

420
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So annoying to push

421
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So curious

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I want to open it

423
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So curious

424
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Let's just open it

425
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What is this?

426
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Come on

427
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Just open it

428
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Help

429
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Help me

430
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What is this?

431
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This box

432
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Is a gift from Professor Adek Barat

433
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
What right do I have to open it?

434
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm a good person

435
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I can't do this

436
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll be punished

437
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Come on

438
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What is this?

439
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What is this?

440
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What is this?

441
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What is this?

442
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What is this?

443
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This miracle merchant

444
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Will release the names of the children

445
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Who will join this competition

446
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And those children

447
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Are two names of Gerhana

448
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And two names of Purna

449
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Who are they?

450
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Who are they?

451
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I have to choose

452
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Start choosing

453
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And the first name is

454
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Alpha

455
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Now you will only be a spectator

456
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Because you won't be chosen

457
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So

458
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I have to be punished by Professor Adek Barat

459
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
To activate this miracle merchant?

460
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yes, Tommy

461
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Just put Tommy's name

462
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But don't put Alpha and Vega's names

463
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Just put the names of the children

464
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Here are the names

465
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Tommy

466
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes

467
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yes

468
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The second name

469
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Jack

470
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes

471
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Congratulations Jack

472
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay

473
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The third name

474
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Tole

475
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes

476
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Congratulations Tole

477
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Thank you Vega

478
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Congratulations Tole

479
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Why is he so strong?

480
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Calm down, he's fat

481
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He'll get wet if he's in the water

482
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The last name

483
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Ray

484
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yes

485
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Congratulations Ray

486
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yes

487
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Congratulations Ray

488
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes

489
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Congratulations Ray

490
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Those are the four names

491
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Who will compete in this competition

492
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Why is he wet again?

493
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Why is he wet again?

494
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Calm down, calm down

495
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
This miracle merchant

496
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Wants one more name

497
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
To be five children

498
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And the name that has been mentioned

499
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Can't be changed

500
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Don't you do it again

501
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes Jack, I don't know

502
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The last name

503
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Alpha

504
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Why is it Alpha?

505
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But it smells

506
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Why is it Alpha?

507
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
To be continued

508
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Why is it Alpha?

509
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But why did you put it in?

510
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Tommy, I don't understand

511
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Why is it Alpha?

512
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What's going on?

513
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Maybe

514
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There's a mysterious person

515
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Who wants to put Alpha in

516
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Just let it be

517
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But we won't let Alpha

518
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And Vega win

519
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Pih

520
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Tell us the first task

521
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
First task

522
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Ray, Alpha

523
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Congratulations

524
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But

525
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You have to fight hard

526
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
To be the winner

527
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Okay?

528
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Wait

529
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Why are you so nervous?

530
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Why are you so quiet?

531
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
What's wrong?

532
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm just confused

533
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Why wasn't I chosen?

534
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Maybe

535
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm stupid

536
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You're so pretty

537
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You're so sensitive

538
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You're nervous

539
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You think you're stupid

540
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Vega

541
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
This kind of competition

542
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Is a common thing

543
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We do it often

544
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So don't think too much

545
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Just relax

546
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Okay?

547
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes, Vega

548
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm not stupid

549
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
All of you are 100

550
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
None of you are 0

551
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You're always the one who answers

552
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
When did you answer?

553
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm always the one who answers

554
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay, sir

555
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll support you

556
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Now

557
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Let's sing our cheer song

558
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay, ready?

559
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
One, two, three

560
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What the six wings

561
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's go

562
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
My plan went well

563
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm so happy

564
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You're such a bad guy

565
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You'll pay for this

566
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You'll pay for this

567
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Shut up

568
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Drink it

569
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You'll pay for this

570
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And don't you dare disturb my plan

571
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You'll pay for this

572
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You'll pay for this

573
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You'll pay for this

574
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Good morning, everyone

575
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Good morning, professor

576
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Now, I want to ask

577
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Who hasn't been to the brown rain?

578
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Raise your hand

579
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Me

580
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So many of you

581
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Okay, brown rain

582
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Come on, take all of them

583
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Take all of them

584
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Don't let any of them go

585
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
If you've taken all of them

586
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Go back to your seats

587
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Go back to your seats

588
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
All of you

589
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
There's still a present for you

590
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's for you

591
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's for you

592
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's for you

593
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Go back to your seats

594
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What do you want?

595
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Okay

596
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Thank you

597
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
My children

598
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Now, we're going to learn

599
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The government's mantra

600
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The government's mantra

601
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Is useful for someone

602
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
To tell them to do something

603
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
My children

604
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This mantra is not easy

605
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
In order for this mantra to work

606
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The person who recites this mantra

607
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Has to have a strong will

608
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Do you understand, my children?

609
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yes, sir

610
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen

611
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Stand on your chair

612
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
The government's mantra

613
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Is useful for someone

614
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Enough

615
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What are you doing here?

616
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Kids

617
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Now you try to

618
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
One by one

619
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Come on

620
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Be careful

621
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Don't forget

622
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Hey

623
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Don't

624
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Look at me

625
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Keep going, professor

626
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The winner is

627
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Sringala

628
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Be careful

629
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Be careful

630
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Be careful

631
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Next

632
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Wega

633
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Please

634
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The government's mantra

635
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Is useful for someone

636
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The government's mantra

637
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Is useful for someone

638
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Congratulations!

639
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Congrats

640
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The winner is

641
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Alva

642
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Did we pass the test?

643
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Please

644
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If you can't do it, you can't do it

645
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Maybe you'll fall

646
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Don't go too far

647
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
We can do it

648
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Jump!

649
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Congratulations!

650
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Good job!

651
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You're the best!

652
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Thank you

653
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Alright

654
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
What do you want to be when you grow up?

655
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't know

656
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You can do it!

657
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The winner is

658
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We're going to sing

659
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The winner is

660
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
We're going to sing

661
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The bell has rung

662
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Please come out

663
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The winner is

664
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Alva

665
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm glad to have you

666
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You have a great talent

667
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm not a professor

668
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The one closest to number one is Vega

669
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The professor also knows

670
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
This is one of your advantages

671
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You have a great heart

672
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And one of the professor's advice

673
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Use the mantra

674
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Properly

675
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Especially in the competition tomorrow

676
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm sure

677
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The mantra will be very useful

678
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And I pray

679
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
That you'll win tomorrow

680
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Thank you

681
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Thank you

682
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Kids

683
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
As soon as you hear the whistle

684
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You have to dive to the bottom of the lake

685
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
When you get there

686
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You have to take a net

687
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
That has been kept by a turtle

688
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
You have to beat the turtle

689
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And bring the net

690
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
To the edge of the lake

691
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
As soon as possible

692
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And now

693
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
In your hands

694
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
There's a box

695
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Inside the box

696
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There's a miniature turtle

697
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That you're going to catch

698
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Please open it

699
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Wow

700
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I got

701
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
A turtle

702
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Ray, you're lucky

703
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Because the turtle

704
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That has a turtle's hair

705
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Is the weakest

706
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Calm down, Ray, cheer up

707
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yes

708
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I got a turtle with a turtle's hair

709
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
This is easy

710
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I got a turtle with a turtle's hair

711
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Wow

712
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I got a turtle

713
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
With eyes

714
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
This turtle is smart

715
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And now

716
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
The first contestant

717
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Nole

718
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Ready

719
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Go

720
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Go

721
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Go

722
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Kids

723
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Looks like the turtle got a net

724
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Because of that

725
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The turtle automatically fell

726
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Wow

727
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Wow

728
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
The turtle is so fierce

729
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I was attacked twice

730
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Actually, I got a turtle

731
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But I was attacked again

732
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Wow

733
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm scared

734
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I hope it won't attack

735
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Calm down, Ray, this is just a normal contest

736
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
If you want to win

737
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You're already in the picture

738
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
That's very good for you

739
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Don't be afraid, Ray, keep fighting

740
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Keep going

741
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Thank you, Nole

742
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And the next contestant

743
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
The second one is

744
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Ray

745
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Please, Ray

746
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Be careful

747
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm going to win

748
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'm going to win

749
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm going to win

750
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
One, two

751
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
One, two

752
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Why isn't there a professor?

753
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Professor Titan

754
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I'm going to win

755
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I'm going to win

756
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Yay

757
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm going to win

758
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Yes, I did it

759
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yes, I did it

760
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I got the net

761
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Why did you take so long, Ray?

762
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yes, because I was in the water

763
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Right?

764
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
That's impossible, I'm Ray

765
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Good, Ray, you did it

766
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And your time is

767
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
30 minutes

768
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
That means, those of you

769
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Who haven't competed yet

770
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Have to beat Ray's time

771
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The next contestant

772
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Jack

773
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
One, two

774
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Green team

775
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Blue team

776
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Calm down, kids

777
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It looks like

778
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Jack also failed to get the net

779
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That means, automatically

780
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Jack also lost

781
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
How come?

782
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
He's so strong

783
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000

15 minutes, Alva

822
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That's the highest record

823
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You have to do it

824
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But, you can't do it

825
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Just give up

826
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
No

827
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000

00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000

00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
This is all thanks to

00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Professor Titan

873
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Thank you so much

00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Professor Titan

877
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Professor Titan

878
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
This is me, Alva

879
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Why is there no sound?

880
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Professor Titan

881
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
This is me, Alva

882
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
No sound

883
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Professor Titan

884
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Professor Titan

885
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Alva

886
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Professor Titan

887
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Professor Titan

888
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Why is there no professor?

889
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Professor Titan

890
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Hurry up

891
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Professor Titan

892
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Hey, Alva

893
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
What are you doing here?

894
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You're still sleeping?

895
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
No, professor

896
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I just want to say thank you

897
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Because of your advice

898
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I won the first contest

899
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You won, Alva

900
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Congratulations, Alva

901
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Congratulations

902
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Professor

903
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Why is it shaking?

904
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Alva, you don't have to be afraid

905
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
What's in the cupboard

906
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Is just a baby centaur

907
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
A baby centaur?

908
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yes

909
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Because a baby centaur

910
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Can produce

911
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
A very powerful poison

912
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And Alva

913
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You don't have to be surprised

914
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And don't be surprised

915
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
If you find weird creatures

916
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
In this room, Alva

917
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Okay

918
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Then

919
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Excuse me

920
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Be careful, Alva

921
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'm going to lose again

922
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm going to lose to Alva

923
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I have to think

924
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
How can I beat Alva

925
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
If I have to

926
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
She can't participate in the next contest

927
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I know how

928
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Help

929
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Help

930
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Help

931
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Someone is asking for help

932
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Help

933
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Help

934
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Her voice is around here

935
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But where?

936
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Help

937
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Help

938
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Maybe

939
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
She's in the warehouse

940
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Hey

941
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Open the door

942
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Open

943
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Hey

944
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Wait

945
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Open

946
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000

952
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Open

953
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I'll open it later

954
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
But if it's done

955
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Open it

956
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Oh my god

957
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Open

958
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It's starting

959
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh my god

960
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Open

961
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000

Alva, you have to succeed

968
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But you have to trust us

969
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yes, Alva

970
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You can't lose

971
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yes, Alva

972
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
If you lose, I'll replace you

973
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Raiz and Alva already know

974
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If I already know

975
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I'll tell Papi

976
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
This time, I'll win

977
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Hahaha

978
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Isn't that Professor Titan?

979
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
What is he doing in front of the warehouse?

980
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
There he is

981
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Professor Nohara

982
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Why are you here?

983
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Show your spirit

984
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Prepare it, my friend

985
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Running, jumping, jumping

986
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
