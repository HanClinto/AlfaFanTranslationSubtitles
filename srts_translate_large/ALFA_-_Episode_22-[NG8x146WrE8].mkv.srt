1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go! Go! Go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let us go!

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let us go!

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Please, let us go!

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll destroy you!

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've told you not to come near the lock,

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
not to open the lock,

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
not to enter the dungeon.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But what happened?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You've violated my advice,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and you've violated your own promise!

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Please don't kill us.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Please don't kill us.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please, Feywon.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
From now on,

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
if you want to open this door,

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you have to tell me.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alva.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to avenge...

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
the people who destroyed me.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the first one...

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Banji.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
To be continued...

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
To be continued...

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's that?

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Stop it!

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Stop it!

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's just go.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We won't win.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's just give up.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, we can't give up.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The future of the school is in our hands.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We have to unite with the monster.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm so scared.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The monster is so big and sharp.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have to be careful.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have to be careful.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have to be careful.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I have to be careful.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have to be careful.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have to be careful.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have to be careful.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's just leave it.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's just leave it.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You want to?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then, just give it up.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You want to?

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Alright.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's go somewhere else.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's go.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The monster is so fierce.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How can I defeat it?

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's just leave it.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't think about them.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's focus on defeating the monster.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay?

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go!

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The monster is so fierce.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How can I defeat it?

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's just leave it.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's just leave it.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We have to focus on defeating the monster.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We have to defeat the monster.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go!

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The monster is so fierce.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How can I defeat it?

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's just stay here.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Instead of going to Onyol.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I agree.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I know that voice.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Me too.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you doing?

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are you doing?

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What are you doing?

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you doing?

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What are you doing?

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sana, push!

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What are you doing?

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you doing?

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I have done some attacks.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I'm sure...

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
...that people will be more curious about you.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Good, Sana.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Keep an eye on Panji.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And wait.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Until the time comes...

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
...you attack him.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's go there.

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Where is the scary face?

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The scary house?

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I want to fix the telescope.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Whatever it takes...

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
...we have to go back there...

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
...and take his heart.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why do you want to be chased again?

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Just look at his face. I'm tired of it.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's why we have to make him happy.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So, we don't get chased.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So, what should we do?

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I know what to do.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What is it?

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We have to protect him.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We have to cook something good for him.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, he'll be nice to us.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to do that too.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Me too.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's go.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come on.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Catch him.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I want to feed him.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Catch him.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Come on. I want to feed him.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
For Panji.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hurry up.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So, we can kill him.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm scared.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We'll get revenge.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's been a long time.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's catch the chicken.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's been a long time.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Chicken.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We got it.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We got it.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We got it.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We got it.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We got it.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We got it.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Guys.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
While Raptor is chasing Tommy, Jake, and Mike.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's attack them from the side.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Remember.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We only have one slogan.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Die once, wait a thousand.

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If someone falls, replace him.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't give up.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Keep your spirit up.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay?

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's go.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The next day.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Sasa.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Who is this?

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sasa.

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We're fighting.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's why you shouldn't be arrogant.

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What's wrong with you, Fiko?

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Why are you so arrogant?

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know that this is for Panji.

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So, I'm going to feed you.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm hungry.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I want chicken.

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But, I'm hungry.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What should I do?

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Firi.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The next day.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Gosh.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We're in trouble.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We're in trouble.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a disaster.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The next day.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Try to go up a little bit.

179
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Higher.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The skin of the raptor...

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is not like a human.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The skin of the raptor is very hard.

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So, it can't be weakened just by tongs.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Then, what should we do?

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Order my men to use the magic spell.

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They have mastered it.

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Nik, fight them with the magic spell.

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes, sir.

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The magic spell.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We did it.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We did it.

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We did it.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You're great, sir.

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Megantara.

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Megantara.

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What's the matter, Professor?

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What are you?

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If I can't catch your tongs,

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
our school will be destroyed.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Gosh.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Ouch.

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's my pleasure.

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Take it back.

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Of course.

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Your tongs are nothing.

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, yes.

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're right.

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come on, everyone.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's concentrate.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Our school is almost done.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, sir.

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's go, everyone.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Our school is done.

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's all because of us.

220
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes.

221
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because we distracted the monster.

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So, they chased us.

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes, that's why, everyone.

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank us.

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Excuse me.

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Is there a phone number?

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Here.

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We made food for you.

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Sir.

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Since when did I marry your aunt?

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm going home.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't like chicken.

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm going to dance.

235
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sir.

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you serious?

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't want to.

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Just make it for me.

239
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Wait.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Make it for me.

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Just for me.

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't.

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm dizzy.

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm scared.

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't want to dance.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Just make it for me.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Those naughty kids.

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They're so naughty.

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Rita.

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If he's a vegetarian, it means it's easier for him to find food.

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I agree.

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Here.

255
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Turn left.

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Here.

257
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Turn right.

258
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Turn left.

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Turn right.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm going to sleep.

261
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm going to miss you.

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm going to miss you.

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What else?

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What else?

265
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Ta-da.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We made food for Mr. Vegetarian.

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you think I'm going to feed you?

269
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's enough.

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Get out of here.

271
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm not hungry.

272
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Do you understand?

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Get out.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Get out.

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He said he's a vegetarian.

276
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't want to.

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know.

278
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's go home.

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm hungry.

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm starving.

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I just want to go home.

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
If you say you want to go home, I'll turn you into chicken.

283
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What should we do?

284
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What should we do?

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Wait.

286
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He said he's a vegetarian.

287
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let's do something else.

288
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What should we do?

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Who is it?

290
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Come here.

291
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Come here.

292
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

293
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Now, they won't bother me anymore.

294
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So, I can sleep peacefully.

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Excuse me.

296
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
To be continued...

297
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
To be continued...

298
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We can do it!

299
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How is it?

300
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you still feel it?

301
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can't stop smiling.

302
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Kids.

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yes, sir.

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't bother me!

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Watch out if they bother me again.

306
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm hungry.

307
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm hungry because I got mad at them.

308
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I ran out of food.

309
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Forget it.

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Let's go shopping.

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I haven't gone out for a while.

312
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
To be continued...

313
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
To be continued...

314
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
To be continued...

315
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Ray, don't give up.

316
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This is for our friend, Alva.

317
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I won't give up for Alva.

318
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Don't be like that.

319
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Datur, it's Alva.

320
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What's wrong with him?

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's help him.

322
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We don't have to help him.

323
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He doesn't even have our scope.

324
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
We can't do that, Ray.

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This is for humanity.

326
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
If someone is in trouble, we have to help them.

327
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's go.

328
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
To be continued...

329
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I can't stay here.

330
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Everyone will be afraid of me.

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
To be continued...

332
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Look at that.

333
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's Medi.

334
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
To be continued...

335
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What's wrong?

336
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
To be continued...

337
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Thank you.

338
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You're a good boy.

339
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay.

340
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'll invite you to dinner at my house.

341
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'll fix your telescope.

342
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yes!

343
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Those kids again.

344
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Why are they here?

345
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Sya!

346
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Let's go.

347
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Uncle.

348
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Wait, Ray.

349
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Why are you afraid of the moon?

350
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because it's big.

351
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You're scary.

352
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But I'm afraid of the moon.

353
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Can you be quiet?

354
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
To be continued...

355
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
To be continued...

356
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I just remembered.

357
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I forgot something.

358
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'll help you later.

359
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Ray.

360
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are you leaving?

361
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes.

362
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But don't expect us to help you again.

363
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We don't like scary kids.

364
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Okay.

365
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
To be continued...

366
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Okay.

367
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll fix your telescope.

368
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Really?

369
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes!

370
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What are you doing?

371
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Because it's big.

372
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But I want you to do one thing.

373
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Don't go anywhere.

374
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Stay here.

375
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And none of you can go to that cave.

376
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Do you understand?

377
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I understand.

378
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Tuli, wake up!

379
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Tuli, wake up!

380
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Tuli, wake up!

381
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Tuli, wake up!

382
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Tuli, wake up!

383
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Tuli, wake up!

384
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Tuli, wake up!

385
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Tuli, wake up!

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Tuli, wake up!

387
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We're so scared.

388
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He didn't tell us.

389
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That cave is so scary.

390
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's so big.

391
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's so big.

392
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm scared.

393
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Omel, you're useless.

394
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's better to fix your telescope now.

395
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's better than nothing.

396
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That's right.

397
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Don't do that, Omel.

398
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Just be patient.

399
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I hope you can fix it soon.

400
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's all I know.

401
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yes.

402
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Help!

403
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I want to go home.

404
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I want to go home.

405
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Let's go home.

406
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm scared.

407
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Let's go home.

408
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
How?

409
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Can you fix it?

410
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Nothing can't be fixed.

411
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's done.

412
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Thank you, Om.

413
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Thank you.

414
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You're so nice.

415
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm leaving.

416
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Thank you, Om.

417
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Thank you.

418
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yes!

419
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Bye, Om.

420
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Bye, Om.

421
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Bye, Om.

422
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Bye, Om.

423
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Bye, Om.

424
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Open it!

425
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Open it!

426
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Open it!

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Open it!

428
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Thank you, Om.

429
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Thank you, Om.

430
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Thank you, Om.

431
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Let's go!

432
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
My friends, wake up!

433
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Pati, Pati!

434
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
My friends, wake up!

435
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, Pati.

436
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Thank you.

437
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yay!

438
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yay!

439
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yay!

440
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yay!

441
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yes, the telescope is right!

442
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I can find Alva!

443
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes!

444
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Hey!

445
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hey!

446
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You!

447
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Stop following us!

448
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I was too excited.

450
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The telescope is right.

451
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Where's Tole?

452
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, right.

453
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He's still unconscious.

454
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Let's go inside.

455
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No.

456
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You go alone.

457
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Or you go with Plita?

458
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I don't want to.

459
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Fine.

460
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll go alone.

461
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Help!

462
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Ouch!

463
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Ouch!

464
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Tole!

465
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It hurts!

466
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What's wrong with you?

467
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You're the one who left me.

469
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I almost got stabbed.

470
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You're the one who left me.

471
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Don't be angry.

472
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Calm down.

473
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
At least you're safe.

474
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Let's go help Alva.

475
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's go.

476
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That's Alva!

477
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Alva is near here.

478
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
She's in the village clinic.

479
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yes!

480
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I want to see her!

481
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Me too!

482
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Me first!

483
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Me first!

484
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Don't fight.

485
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Me first!

486
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Don't fight.

487
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The telescope.

488
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's look for Alva.

489
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Let's go.

490
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Let's go.

491
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Ouch!

492
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It hurts.

493
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It hurts.

494
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It hurts.

495
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It hurts.

496
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It hurts.

497
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It hurts.

498
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It hurts.

499
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It hurts.

500
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It hurts.

501
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It hurts.

502
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It hurts.

503
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It hurts.

504
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It hurts.

505
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It hurts.

506
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm sure it's Panji's doing.

507
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Panji has a monster.

508
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yes.

509
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's Panji.

510
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You don't have any feelings.

511
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay.

512
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Let's do this at Panji's house.

513
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I want to see Alva!

514
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I want to see Alva!

515
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I want to see Alva!

516
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I want to see Alva!

517
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I want to see Alva!

518
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You don't have any feelings.

519
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You don't have any feelings.

520
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You guys?

521
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Why are you here?

522
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We're looking for you.

523
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Let's go home.

524
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Come here.

525
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
We can go back to school.

526
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Come on, Alva.

527
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What's wrong, Alva?

528
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't know.

529
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I still have something to do.

530
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
What is it?

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's none of your business.

532
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's none of your business.

533
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Do you know why?

534
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yes.

535
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I want to decorate Panji's house.

536
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Panji's house?

537
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Panji's house.

538
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Why do you want to go there again?

539
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's a scary house.

540
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's scary.

541
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Are you from there?

542
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yes.

543
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
We repaired this telescope.

544
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It was broken.

545
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Why did you repair it?

546
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's haunted.

547
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I want to know who it belongs to.

548
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Here, wear this.

549
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Okay.

550
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I hope it's not a ghost.

551
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It's not here yet.

552
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Let's try here.

553
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Let's try here.

554
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's broken.

555
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's broken again.

556
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's broken again.

557
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Let's repair this at Panji's house.

558
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I want to go there.

559
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I want to go there.

560
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Don't.

561
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Don't.

562
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I don't want to go there.

563
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I want to go there by myself.

564
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I don't want to go there.

565
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm scared.

566
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I want to go there.

567
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I know.

568
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But, I don't trust Sandra.

569
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
They keep asking for help.

570
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Look at them.

571
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
They're attacked by Panji's monsters.

572
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I feel sorry for them.

573
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I want to go to Panji's house.

574
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Do you want to come?

575
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
If you don't want to come, it's okay.

576
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'll go there by myself.

577
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's okay.

578
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'll go with you.

579
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Me too.

580
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

581
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You want to come too, right?

582
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
We're friends.

583
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay.

584
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
One, two, three.

585
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
One, two, three.

586
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Zing!

587
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Zing!

588
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Zing!

589
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Why are they there?

590
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I have a plan.

591
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What is it?

592
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Sir.

593
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm sorry, sir.

594
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I can make Panji appear in front of the people.

595
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If he appears in front of the people...

596
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
...he'll be fired, sir.

597
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You're an idiot, Angkara.

598
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Why didn't you do what I told you?

599
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But, sir...

600
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Shut up!

601
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't want to ruin all of my plans.

602
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We'll wait until the full moon.

603
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Because that's the right time for us to do it.

604
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Tonight is the night of the full moon.

605
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I have to hide.

606
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I can't go out.

607
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because I don't want to hurt anyone.

608
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm sorry, sir.

609
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Because I don't want to hurt anyone.

610
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm sorry, sir.

611
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Excuse me.

612
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Who is this?

613
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
What are you doing here?

614
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Sir.

615
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
The telescope is broken.

616
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Can you fix it?

617
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Come here.

618
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
This is what makes me angry.

619
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Wait.

620
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's safe.

621
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's okay.

622
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Why is it so dark?

623
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's easy to get in.

624
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
There.

625
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Why can't I do it?

626
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Go upstairs.

627
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Why is there a password?

628
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You're wrong.

629
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Remember.

630
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
If you're wrong three times, you'll be blocked.

631
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You're blocked.

632
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I can't tell anyone.

633
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Sir.

634
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Tentot.

635
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Tentot.

636
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You're wrong again.

637
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm wrong again.

638
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What's the password?

639
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Last chance.

640
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
15 seconds left.

641
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I just saw you here.

642
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What's your name?

643
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
If you're wrong, you'll be blocked.

644
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What's my name?

645
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Why is it open?

646
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You said the password.

647
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Why is it open?

648
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You said the password.

649
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Please come in.

650
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So, what's the password?

651
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That's it.

652
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
This can't be fixed.

653
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's badly damaged.

654
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Here.

655
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You can go home now.

656
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I still have things to do.

657
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It hurts.

658
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
We're so tired.

659
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Can we stay here for a while?

660
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
My leg hurts.

661
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Let's stay here.

662
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's promise not to make any noise.

663
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Okay.

664
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That's...

665
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Dad.

666
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Mom.

667
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Wake up.

668
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Dad.

669
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Dad, wake up.

670
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Mom.

671
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Wake up.

672
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Dad.

673
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Wake up.

674
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Dad.

675
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Dad, wake up.

676
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Mom.

677
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Mom.

678
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Wake up.

679
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
How can he breathe?

680
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So, they're still alive.

681
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Dad, wake up.

682
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Mom.

683
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Mom, wake up.

684
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Mom, wake up.

685
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Wake up.

686
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Mom.

687
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Wake up.

688
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Dad.

689
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Dad, wake up.

690
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Dad, wake up.

691
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Dad, wake up.

692
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Wake up.

693
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Dad.

694
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So...

695
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
...they're just here for fun.

696
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
My dad is so stubborn.

697
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Now, my dad is being punished.

698
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I have to let him go.

699
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Uncle Ancol.

700
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Uncle Ancol.

701
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Mom, what's wrong?

702
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Dad.

703
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Mom.

704
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
To be continued...

705
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
To be continued...

706
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Someone broke into the cave.

707
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I don't know what to do.

708
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Let's hide.

709
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
No.

710
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
We have to help him.

711
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Let's go.

712
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Let's go.

713
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Mom.

714
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Dad.

715
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Mom.

716
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Stop.

717
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Stop.

718
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
What did you do?

719
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You can't free them this way.

720
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But, you killed them.

721
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
They can't get out of here.

722
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I just want to free my parents.

723
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Go.

724
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Get out of here.

725
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You don't have to know.

726
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'll kill you if you leave.

727
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
No.

728
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Who are you?

729
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You're the one who kidnapped my parents.

730
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Your parents?

731
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You said, your parents?

732
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Don't be ridiculous.

733
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
No, I'm not.

734
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm Alfa.

735
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And they're my parents.

736
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You're Alfa.

737
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yes, I'm Alfa.

738
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
They're my parents.

739
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Why did you kidnap them?

740
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Alfa.

741
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Alfa.

742
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Alfa.

743
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Alfa.

744
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Alfa.

745
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Alfa.

746
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
You have to listen to me.

747
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Wait.

748
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Wait.

749
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I'll explain.

750
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
The truth.

751
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Don't be ridiculous.

752
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
This is bad.

753
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
This is bad. I'm going to change.

754
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Alfa.

755
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Alfa.

756
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You have to leave.

757
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You too.

758
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You have to leave.

759
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Now.

760
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Now, you have to leave.

761
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
No.

762
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I want to go.

763
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Don't be ridiculous.

764
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Both of you have to leave.

765
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You're possessed.

766
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You're possessed.

767
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Bebiksa.

768
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Bebiksa.

769
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Bebiksa.

770
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Bebiksa.

771
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Bebiksa.

772
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Bebiksa.

773
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Alfa.

774
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Alfa.

775
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Alfa.

776
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Alfa.

777
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Alfa.

778
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Where is he?

779
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Maybe he's gone.

780
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Maybe.

781
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's time to attack.

782
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Alfa.

783
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You have to let them go.

784
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Don't touch them.

785
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
If we let them go, they'll faint.

786
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
They can't breathe.

787
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Let's look for him.

788
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
He's the only one who knows how to do it.

789
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Let's go.

790
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
He's over there.

791
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Mr. Panji.

792
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Mr. Panji.

793
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Mr. Panji.

794
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
What should we do?

795
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Mr. Panji.

796
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Mr. Panji.

797
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Mr. Panji.

798
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
He's not here.

799
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Mr. Panji.

800
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Where is he?

801
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Don't.

802
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
He ran away.

803
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Let's go back to school.

804
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Let's go back to school.

805
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We'll tell the teachers about this.

806
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Yes.

807
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Then, we'll come back here.

808
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
No.

809
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I don't want to.

810
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
If we go back there,

811
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
maybe my parents are gone.

812
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Where's the telescope?

813
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Where's the telescope?

814
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Here.

815
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
But,

816
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
the telescope is broken.

817
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It can't be used anymore.

818
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's totally broken.

819
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We can't fix it.

820
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Maybe there's a clue.

821
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Let's try.

822
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Where is it?

823
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
There's a sound.

824
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Why is there a sound?

825
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't know.

826
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Maybe,

827
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
he didn't show it to us.

828
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But, he tried to point it out.

829
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Maybe it's because of the sound.

830
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's impossible.

831
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
That's not possible.

832
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
The telescope is broken.

833
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
There's nothing wrong with trying.

834
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You know it.

835
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Where's the telescope?

836
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I don't know.

837
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm scared.

838
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It's scary.

839
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
No.

840
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm not scared.

841
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm brave.

842
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'll find my dad.

843
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Please, help me.

844
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Please, take care of my parents.

845
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'll be back.

846
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
No.

847
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
The monster is back.

848
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's broken.

849
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
He's not brave.

850
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm scared.

851
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Let's go in.

852
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Where is it?

853
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There it is.

854
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Let's try again.

855
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's behind us.

856
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Kill them all.

857
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Don't let them escape.

858
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes, sir.

859
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Change the target.

860
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Attack them all.

861
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Yes, sir.

862
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Kill them all.

863
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Don't let them escape.

864
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Yes, sir.

865
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Hurry.

866
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Where is my dad?

867
00:54:45,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Where is my dad?

868
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I have to find him immediately

869
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I have to find my dad

870
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Because

871
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I have to save both of them for me

872
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
There's a raptor too

873
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
There's a raptor too

874
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
There's a raptor too

875
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
There's a raptor too

876
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Professor Antara

877
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I've defeated you once, Panci

878
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I've defeated you once, Panci

879
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
What?

880
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
The kid is still alive?

881
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Agar!

882
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Hurry and finish that kid and that animal

883
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Hurry!

884
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I want to see that kid

885
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Agar!

886
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Agar!

887
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Agar!

888
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Agar!

889
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Hurry!

890
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Why isn't Asma here yet?

891
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Don't!

892
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
What is it now?

893
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Don't tell anyone

894
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Okay

895
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It's better if Asma doesn't come back

896
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Let's just follow him

897
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
To the cave

898
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'm tired

899
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm exhausted

900
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Let's just wait

901
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Don't!

902
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
What's inside?

903
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Let me go!

904
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Let me go!

905
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Let me go!

906
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Let me go!

907
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Don't torture me!

908
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Don't!

909
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Don't torture me!

910
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Don't torture me!

911
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Don't!

912
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Don't torture me!

913
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Don't!

914
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Don't torture me!

915
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Don't torture me!

916
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Don't be noisy!

917
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You're so noisy!

918
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Let me go!

919
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I want to see the kid

920
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Let me go!

921
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Let me go!

922
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Don't do that

923
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I want to see the animal

924
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I want to see the animal

925
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I want to see the animal

926
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Let me go!

927
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Fireball!

928
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Fireball!

929
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Now, this is the time!

930
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Now, I can save you, Panji.

931
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Where are you, Alva?

932
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Are you scared?

933
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh, poor you.

934
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
That's right.

935
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Because your power is not as strong as mine.

936
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Where are you, Alva?

937
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Who's scared?

938
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You're new, right?

939
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Who's scared?

940
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You're back, right?

941
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But I have to finish you first, Panji.

942
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
She's gone.

943
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You're confused, right?

944
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
There's no Purwosongkara.

945
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
This must be Alva's trick.

946
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Alva, get out!

947
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
What are you doing?

948
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Angkara!

949
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
How dare you attack me, Angkara?

950
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I'm sorry, sir. It's nothing, sir.

951
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
What's wrong with the old man?

952
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You've ruined them.

953
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Answer me!

954
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Don't be angry, sir.

955
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You'll be in trouble later.

956
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Shut up!

957
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
You must be angry.

958
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Right?

959
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Right, Angkara?

960
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Answer me!

961
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I told you to shut up.

962
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Alva, get out!

963
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
He's shocked.

964
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
To be continued...

965
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
But how, professor?

966
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Meanwhile, we know...

967
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
that the 8th prince...

968
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
has recovered.

969
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
In fact...

970
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
he's getting stronger.

971
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The only way...

972
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
is to find the soul stone.

973
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Find the soul stone.

974
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Alright.

975
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Professor.

976
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Allow me to find it.

977
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Don't, Megantara.

978
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
This mission is too dangerous.

979
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And I don't want to involve the children.

980
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
We don't need to involve the children.

981
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's better...

982
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
if I...

983
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and the other professors...

984
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
will go on this mission.

985
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
That's the problem, Megantara.

986
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Whether we want to or not...

987
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
we have to involve the children.

988
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Because the soul stone...

989
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
is filled by the 8th prince's soul.

990
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It can only be seen by the children.

991
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
To be continued...

992
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
To be continued...

993
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I'm going to throw up.

994
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm going to throw up.

995
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Let's go.

996
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Wait!

997
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
What's that?

998
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
What's that?

999
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
What's that?

1000
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I don't know.

1001
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I'm sure it's Alva.

1002
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Alva, where are you?

1003
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Alva!

1004
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Alva, come out!

1005
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
You scared me.

1006
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Alva, I'm going to look for...

1007
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
the soul stone.

1008
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I'm going home with Gugug.

1009
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's not Gugug.

1010
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That's Serigala.

1011
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Alva, what are you doing with Serigala?

1012
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Where are you from?

1013
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm from Suram.

1014
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I saw a raptor attacking Serigala.

1015
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Raptor?

1016
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Yes, a raptor.

1017
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's a creature from Angkara.

1018
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It attacked Serigala and fainted.

1019
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
If Serigala lost...

1020
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
why did you bring it here?

1021
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Are you going to cure it?

1022
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Come on.

1023
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
This is not about Serigala.

1024
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Then?

1025
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Papa Anji!

1026
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Papa Anji?

1027
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yes, he's hiding in Serigala.

1028
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Serigala is so cute.

1029
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Rita, don't be scared.

1030
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I'll give you a name, Serigala.

1031
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It's called...

1032
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Pleki.

1033
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Rita, why Pleki?

1034
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Pleki is a raptor's name.

1035
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Be careful.

1036
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Rita, don't!

1037
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Wake up.

1038
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Let's play.

1039
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Sir.

1040
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'm sorry, sir.

1041
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I promise...

1042
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I'll do my best, sir.

1043
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Sir.

1044
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Very well.

1045
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I'll give you one more chance.

1046
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But don't fail.

1047
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
We don't have much time.

1048
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
We only have six hours...

1049
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
before the sun sets.

1050
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And I don't want...

1051
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Serigala to turn into a rat.

1052
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Do you understand?

1053
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yes, sir.

1054
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm ready.

1055
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Why did you call me?

1056
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I want you...

1057
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
to come to my house.

1058
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Everyone!

1059
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Don't hesitate to attack the child.

1060
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
They attack everything.

1061
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
They are evil.

1062
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
No.

1063
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
That's a lie.

1064
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
They are evil.

1065
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Dad.

1066
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Mom.

1067
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Dad.

1068
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Mom.

1069
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
To be continued...

1070
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
To be continued...
