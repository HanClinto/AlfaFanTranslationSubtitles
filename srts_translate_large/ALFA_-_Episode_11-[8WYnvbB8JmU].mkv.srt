1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Go! Go! Go!

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's locked.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What should I do?

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm getting more and more scared.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think this is an attack.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, Professor, what is this?

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is one of the special powers of one of the students in this school.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What about Alfa?

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What about Alfa?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alfa has been locked up twice.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was bitten by Alfa.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is messed up.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Alfa must be in pain.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have to help Alfa.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey!

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's a snake that eats stones and papayas.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Guard!

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Open the door for me!

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Guard!

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Open the door!

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Open the door for me, quick!

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm holding the door handle.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Guard!

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Open the door!

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm in pain, Prof.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm freezing.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm cold.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm begging you to heal me.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't move, Prof.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have to take the fire scythe.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But, Professor,

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the fire scythe is in the highest tower in the school.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I think I should move.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And I think I should move.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There's no other way.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Only the fire scythe can warm this room.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ani,

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
call Megantara

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and give her this bell.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, Prof.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Dafatang,

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the paper.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Megantara,

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
come back quickly.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The magic school is in trouble.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I've brought the bell back

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
because Dana is freezing.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Dafatang,

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the paper.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Dafatang,

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the paper.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Find Megantara no matter what.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm so full.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can't move my legs.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I've used up the fire scythe.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've used up the fire scythe.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you for finishing your meal.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now, it's time for you to drink the juice.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, drink the juice.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's that?

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What's that?

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What's that?

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have to do it.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes, Mega.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You have to be patient.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have to do it.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I have to fight this for Alva.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't do that for myself.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alva, what's wrong?

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Alva.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's terrible.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My body is covered with snake skin.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What should I do?

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Megatara

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Megatara

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Megatara

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Megatara

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Megatara

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Megatara

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Megatara

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Megatara

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Megatara

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Megatara

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's so weird.

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Every time I send a letter,

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have to type it first.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is the back button of Professor Ardebar.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It means,

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
there's something very important at school.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What should I do?

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I have to go to school.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have to go to school.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have to go to school.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have to go to school.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I have to go to school.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What should I do?

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Alva's business is not done yet.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's another problem.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't type my sentence.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's useless.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Just type it.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Delete it.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He's used to typing.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Alright.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll be back soon.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But, wait.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Until Alva's business is done.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wow.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's so cool.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If this is the way,

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't have to work as a teacher anymore.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're just a lazy kid.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's why you're left behind.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Go back to Professor Agni.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Alva's business is not done yet.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Alva's business is not done yet.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is so scary.

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I feel like I'm losing my hearing.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now, you have to do another test.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a board painting competition.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You have to do it manually.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Without magic.

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Without mantra.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The last one...

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
will be eliminated.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please go to the painting house.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Painting is easy.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But, I'm not good at it.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Both of you will fail.

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You know,

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
there's an old saying.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There's a noisy person,

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but he doesn't have a brain.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sorry.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If a ghost fights a human,

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the ghost will win.

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Who said that?

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Humans are more noble.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, humans will win.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Ghost.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Human.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ghost.

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Human.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ghost.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You have to paint the wall that has your name on it.

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Do it neatly and quickly.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The oldest one will be eliminated.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We'll start on the count of three.

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
One.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Two.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Three.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
One.

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Two.

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Three.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Four.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Five.

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Six.

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Seven.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Eight.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Nine.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Ten.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Eleven.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Twelve.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thirteen.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Fourteen.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Fifteen.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sixteen.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Seventeen.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Eighteen.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Nineteen.

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Twenty.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Twenty-one.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Twenty-two.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Twenty-three.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Twenty-three.

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Twenty-three.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Twenty-three.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Twenty-three.

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Twenty-three.

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Several years.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Go! Go! Go!

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Won't stop to dream.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Go! Go! Go!

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't ever stop.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Go! Go! Go!

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Try with the power of your heart.

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Go! Go! Go!

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Make yourself proud.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Go! Go! Go!

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We can do it.

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Vega, you shouldn't be like this.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because of me, you lost.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's okay. Our goal here is to get that ring.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So if one of us loses, what else can we do?

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The important thing is you have to continue.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You have to win, okay?

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Just make sure my fight with Ray is not in vain.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you, Vega.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry, Vega. You have to go home now.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Vega.

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You failed too.

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Vega?

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What else can I do?

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He's weak.

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And Alva is so weak.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I helped him.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I still lost.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Vega, what about you?

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You know Alva is weak.

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why did you let him win?

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But the way to live is to love Alva.

223
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What about you?

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I forgot.

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why did I think like that?

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I just want to talk to Alva.

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hey.

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Shut up.

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
A forester eats pondo salad.

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Vega is not stupid.

231
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Vega is just nice.

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No matter what the reason is, fighting and sacrificing for a friend...

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
...will never pay off.

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But, soldier.

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But, soldier.

236
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Stop saying but.

237
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's better for Vega...

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
...to fight for a friend.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
To work hard.

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Than you.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You failed because you don't want to eat vegetables.

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Vegetable chicken.

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is the last round.

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The decision will determine who deserves to get the life fluid.

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You have to run until the finish line.

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The one who arrives first is the winner.

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Remember.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You can't use any spell here.

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I tried my best.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But, I can't give up.

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I want to win.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I believe in you, Vega.

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
One.

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Two.

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Three.

256
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I won.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I won.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I won.

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I won.

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I won.

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Alva.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Come on.

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's not that long.

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's better for you to run.

265
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I will win.

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is what we call winning in a battle.

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm excited.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But, Izan.

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I've been waiting for you.

270
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Alva.

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Alva.

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Alva, wake up.

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Alva.

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Alva.

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Alva, wake up.

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You guys.

277
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Wake up, Alva.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can't die.

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But, I can't take it anymore.

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
My body hurts.

281
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Alva.

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You can't ruin your friends' fight.

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's true, Alva.

284
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They've sacrificed for you.

285
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't let them be a burden.

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Alva, wake up.

287
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Alva.

288
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Alva, wake up.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Alva, wake up.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Alva, wake up.

291
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Alva.

292
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't be like this.

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Because of me, you lost.

294
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's okay.

295
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're here to help us.

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So, if we lose, what should we do?

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You have to win.

298
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay?

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You're right.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
These are my friends.

301
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Good.

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Now, stand up.

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And be brave.

304
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Be brave.

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't let them be a burden.

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Give up.

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Chase your passion and dreams.

308
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Go, go, go.

309
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Achieve all your dreams.

310
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Go, go, go.

311
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I won't give up.

312
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I won't give up.

313
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I won't give up.

314
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Now, it's time to say goodbye to the ghost.

315
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
To be continued...

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Ibu.

317
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Ibu, what's wrong with you?

318
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
How can you run that fast?

319
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Where are you coming from?

320
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, my God.

321
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Help me.

322
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Chase your passion and dreams.

323
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Go, go, go.

324
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Achieve all your dreams.

325
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Go, go, go.

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't ever give up.

327
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Raya.

328
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What?

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Do you think you won?

330
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wrong.

331
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I won, you lost.

332
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Whatever.

333
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's obvious.

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Don't you trust me?

335
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I won.

336
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's up to you.

337
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Raya.

338
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank God.

339
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
This firecracker is really useful.

340
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But we can't go on like this, Professor.

341
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We have to find Pelita.

342
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And stop her before she freezes this school.

343
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Purwa is right.

344
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We have to find Pelita immediately.

345
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I order all teachers to find Pelita.

346
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Split up to find her.

347
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Kids.

348
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You stay here.

349
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't go anywhere.

350
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes, sir.

351
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I will leave this firecracker here.

352
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So, you won't be left behind.

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yes, sir.

354
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, no.

355
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Because you arrived at the finish line at the same time.

356
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Then, you two take the liquid of life.

357
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Whoever finishes first, he is entitled to get the liquid of life.

358
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
One.

359
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Two.

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Three.

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Start.

362
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Four.

363
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Five.

364
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Six.

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Seven.

366
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Eight.

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Nine.

368
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Ten.

369
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Eleven.

370
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Twelve.

371
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thirteen.

372
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Fourteen.

373
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Fifteen.

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Sixteen.

375
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Seventeen.

376
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Eighteen.

377
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Nineteen.

378
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Twenty.

379
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Twenty-one.

380
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Twenty-two.

381
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Twenty-three.

382
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Twenty-four.

383
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Twenty-five.

384
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Twenty-six.

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Twenty-seven.

386
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Twenty-eight.

387
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Twenty-nine.

388
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Twenty-ten.

389
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Twenty-eleven.

390
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Twenty-eleven.

391
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Twenty-nine.

392
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Twenty-three.

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Twenty-four.

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Twenty-arch?

395
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Ten.

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Huh?

397
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Wha?

398
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Wait!

399
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Argh.

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Where's the bottle?

401
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Hey, Afat.

402
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Did you take the bottle?

403
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Here, give it back!

404
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You are such a mean!

405
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Wait!

406
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't know!

407
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Afat!

408
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What are you doing?

409
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Here, give it back!

410
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's my brother's!

411
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's mine!

412
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Give it back!

413
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I don't know!

414
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Raya.

415
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
In this competition,

416
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the participants must be honest and fair.

417
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They can't cheat.

418
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What?

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You've cheated and been unsportive by pushing Alfa.

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So, you're out.

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And we've decided,

422
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Alfa will be the winner of this competition.

423
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What?

424
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes!

425
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Thank you, jury!

426
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Thank you so much!

427
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Melitha?

428
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Melitha?

429
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Where's our daughter?

430
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Melitha?

431
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Melitha?

432
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Melitha?

433
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Melitha?

434
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Melitha?

435
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Melitha?

436
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Melitha?

437
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
She's not here.

438
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Then,

439
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
let's just look for my crystal ball.

440
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Okay.

441
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Then, hurry up and look for it.

442
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay.

443
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Daftar,

444
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
crystal ball!

445
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There she is!

446
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Melitha!

447
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Melitha!

448
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Melitha!

449
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Melitha!

450
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Melitha!

451
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Melitha!

452
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Melitha!

453
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Melitha!

454
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Melitha!

455
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Melitha!

456
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What happened to my crystal ball?

457
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm so sorry.

458
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We'll soon find out where Melitha is.

459
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Melitha!

460
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
My little sister,

461
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
why are you crying?

462
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Who are you?

463
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm a prince from a faraway land.

464
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm Melitha.

465
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Why are you crying here?

466
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm a weirdo.

467
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Everyone hates me.

468
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't want to be friends anymore.

469
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
If I'm wrong, everyone will blame me.

470
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Then, we're the same.

471
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What do you mean?

472
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I don't have any friends anymore.

473
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Almost everyone in this world hates me.

474
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm considered a problem.

475
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What if we become friends?

476
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But, are you afraid of me?

477
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I have a strange power.

478
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I can freeze everyone.

479
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Since we're friends,

480
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll tell you my secret.

481
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I also have a strange power.

482
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I can't freeze.

483
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Are you sure you want to be friends with me?

484
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Hold my hand.

485
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You can see for yourself.

486
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't freeze.

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Professor Aldebaran,

488
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I got a message from Professor Agni.

489
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
School is in danger.

490
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But, who will do it?

491
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll do it.

492
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'll do it.

493
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll do it.

494
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll do it.

495
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'll do it.

496
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll do it.

497
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll do it.

498
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll do it.

499
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll do it.

500
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But, who will do it?

501
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's morning.

502
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Where's Alvan?

503
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Ri, wake up.

504
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Ri, wake up.

505
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Look, it's morning.

506
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes, it's morning.

507
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What time is it?

508
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's why I want to ask.

509
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Alva hasn't come yet.

510
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Alva hasn't come yet.

511
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What?

512
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Alva hasn't come yet.

513
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Alva hasn't come yet?

514
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Alva hasn't come yet.

515
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm scared.

516
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Alva.

517
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Alva.

518
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Are you okay?

519
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Alva.

520
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Did you succeed?

521
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Alva.

522
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alva.

523
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Are you okay?

524
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
No.

525
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Alva.

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Alva.

527
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Alva.

528
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm scared.

529
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Be careful.

530
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Alva must have been possessed by an evil magic.

531
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What magic is this?

532
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Alva.

533
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Alva.

534
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's impossible.

535
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Congratulations. You succeeded.

536
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Not yet.

537
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Alva.

538
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Alva.

539
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm relieved.

540
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Finally, you're safe.

541
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes, Alva.

542
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is for you.

543
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Thank you.

544
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Hold this.

545
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:46,000
To be continued...

546
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Centara.

547
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Forgive me.

548
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But, thank you too, Centara.

549
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Centara.

550
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,000
To be continued...

551
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Centara.

552
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Forgive me.

553
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
To be continued...

554
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:48,000
To be continued...

555
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What's wrong, Centara?

556
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What's wrong?

557
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I almost forgot.

558
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We have to go to school.

559
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Why?

560
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
This is a letter from Professor Ali Baran.

561
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I got a letter from him.

562
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Our school is in danger.

563
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Danger? What danger?

564
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So, we have to go back to school.

565
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This letter will help us get to school.

566
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Let's go.

567
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Hold this.

568
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Are you ready?

569
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes.

570
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
To be continued...

571
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Welcome, Alva.

572
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm happy...

573
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
...that you're safe.

574
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Thank you, Professor.

575
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Professor Ali Baran.

576
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I got a letter from Professor Aki.

577
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Our school is in danger.

578
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But, who did this?

579
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It was Pelita.

580
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Pelita?

581
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Pelita?

582
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But, that's impossible.

583
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We didn't expect it either.

584
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But, it turns out...

585
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
...Pelita has a special ability.

586
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But, unfortunately...

587
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
...she can't control that ability.

588
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So, when she's angry, angry, sad...

589
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
...feeling lonely, scared...

590
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
...that power will come out.

591
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And what touches her...

592
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
...can freeze her.

593
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So, where's Pelita now?

594
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Until now, we haven't been able to find her.

595
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Telescope!

596
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Telescope.

597
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Ray.

598
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Telescope.

599
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Try using this telescope.

600
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Where's Pelita?

601
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Let's go.

602
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The food is so good.

603
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There's ice cream.

604
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Ferment.

605
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Bakso.

606
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Ray, focus.

607
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Find Pelita.

608
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You're the one who thinks about food first.

609
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The food is cold. I'm hungry.

610
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Pelita.

611
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Can you hear me, Pelita?

612
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's her.

613
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's Pelita.

614
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Alpha.

615
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Pelita is with a man in a veil.

616
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But, who is that, Prof?

617
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Or maybe...

618
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
...Professor Angkara.

619
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But, they look different.

620
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I brought warm chocolate for you.

621
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Here.

622
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
To keep your body warm.

623
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Pelita.

624
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Pelita.

625
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Wait.

626
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Who are you?

627
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
To be continued...

628
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Popo?

629
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
We can do this.

630
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Alpha.

631
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Where are you?

632
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Alpha.

633
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Alpha.

634
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Alpha, where are you?

635
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Where are you, Alpha?

636
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Alpha.

637
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Alpha.

638
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That's Aldebar's voice.

639
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I can't face him with this kind of power.

640
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Alpha.

641
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Alpha.

642
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Alpha.

643
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Alpha.

644
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Alpha.

645
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Get up.

646
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Alpha.

647
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You're a handsome boy.

648
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Why do you look like this?

649
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Alpha.

650
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Who did this to you?

651
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Alpha.

652
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Alpha.

653
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Alpha.

654
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Alpha.

655
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Alpha.

656
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Alpha.

657
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Alpha.

658
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Alpha.

659
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Alpha.

660
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Alpha.

661
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Alpha.

662
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Alpha.

663
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Alpha.

664
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Alpha.

665
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Alpha.

666
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Alpha.

667
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Alpha.

668
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Alpha.

669
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
How is he, Professor?

670
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
He's fine.

671
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
We should go back inside.

672
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Let's help Alpha.

673
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Alpha.

674
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Alpha.

675
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Alpha.

676
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Alpha.

677
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Alpha.

678
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Alpha.

679
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Alpha.

680
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Alpha.

681
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Megantara's feeling says...

682
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
...that Professor Aldebaran...

683
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
...is hiding something.

684
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
How long are we going to stay here?

685
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's going to be a long time, Pat.

686
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Be patient.

687
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
The professor is trying to...

688
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
...let us recover.

689
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Let's just wait here.

690
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Because of the monster, we're like this.

691
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
The school is frozen.

692
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
We can't play.

693
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's so cold.

694
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I wish we could go home.

695
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Firecrackers.

696
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So this is how you play when it's cold.

697
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I know how to use this situation.

698
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
If Chris isn't there,

699
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
they'll be in trouble.

700
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And Aldebaran won't be able to use his magic...

701
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
...because it's too cold.

702
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Stupid.

703
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Where are you taking me?

704
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Where are you taking me?

705
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm taking you to a place where you can rest.

706
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I don't want to.

707
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I want to go down.

708
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Calm down.

709
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'll stop.

710
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You can go down.

711
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Let's go.

712
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
To be continued...

713
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
To be continued...

714
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
This is so weird.

715
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
He's always doing this to me.

716
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And his classmates...

717
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
He's lying.

718
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm the one who sent him to his room.

719
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Just kick him out.

720
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Or just kick him out.

721
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

722
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
He kicked me out of school.

723
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Because I don't want to see him again.

724
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
He did it himself.

725
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Don't believe him.

726
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You have to kick him out of this school.

727
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Kick him out.

728
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Guys, let's just go.

729
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Don't waste our time on him.

730
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Let's just go to the show.

731
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Let's go.

732
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
To be continued...

733
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
To be continued...

734
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
To be continued...

735
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
To be continued...

736
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I have bad news.

737
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And also good news.

738
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
What is it, Professor?

739
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Alfa.

740
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I think he met the 8th prince.

741
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The good news is...

742
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Alfa is safe.

743
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Even though his face is a bit wounded.

744
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
The bad news is...

745
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The 8th prince has taken Plita away.

746
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Purwa.

747
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I want you to find Plita's whereabouts.

748
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
As soon as you find her, let me know.

749
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yes, Professor.

750
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
To be continued...

751
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
All of you can go back to the clinic.

752
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And stay alert.

753
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I will call Alfa.

754
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
To train him to be stronger.

755
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Because one day...

756
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
He might meet the 8th prince.

757
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes, Professor.

758
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
To be continued...

759
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It's true what he said.

760
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
To be continued...

761
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Professor is calling me.

762
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Alfa.

763
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I called you here...

764
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Because I want to teach you...

765
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The Pegasus Mantra.

766
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Pegasus Mantra?

767
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
What is that, Professor?

768
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Pegasus Mantra...

769
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Is a mantra...

770
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That can create friends when you're alone.

771
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And you have to fight strong enemies.

772
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Like before.

773
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I will set an example for you.

774
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Pegasus!

775
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Wow!

776
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So cool!

777
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Alfa.

778
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Now, go to me.

779
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Yes, Professor.

780
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Look, Alfa.

781
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This friend of mine...

782
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Will protect me till the end.

783
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And I...

784
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Can pull myself from the enemy.

785
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Or distract the enemy's attention.

786
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
He's gone!

787
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Alfa.

788
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Which animal do you like the most?

789
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Garuda bird, Professor.

790
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Very good.

791
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Now...

792
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Concentrate.

793
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And imagine Garuda bird on your head.

794
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Then...

795
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Say the Pegasus Mantra.

796
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Concentrate, Alfa.

797
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yes, Professor.

798
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Pegasus!

799
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Why is it a chicken?

800
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Alfa.

801
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Your enemy can't be afraid of a chicken.

802
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Come on.

803
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Try again.

804
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Pegasus!

805
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Wow!

806
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's so young.

807
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm so happy.

808
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm going to be laughed at by the enemy.

809
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Alright, Alfa.

810
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
That's all for today.

811
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Now, you should rest.

812
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
We'll continue tomorrow.

813
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yes, Professor.

814
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'll go now.

815
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
To be continued...

816
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Alfa.

817
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What were you doing there?

818
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I was taught a new mantra.

819
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Huh?

820
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
A new mantra?

821
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yes.

822
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So that I can be stronger than the enemy.

823
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Who was the enemy that you met?

824
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yes.

825
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
He said...

826
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's Eid.

827
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm so worried.

828
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I don't know...

829
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
If it's going to be a strong Eid.

830
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Don't, don't.

831
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
The 8th call.

832
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The 8th call.

833
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
The 8th call.

834
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Who did this?

835
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Come out!

836
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Who did this?

837
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Come out!

838
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Who did this?

839
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Come out!

840
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Who did this?

841
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Come out!

842
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Who did this?

843
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Come out!

844
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Who did this?

845
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Come out!

846
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Who did this?

847
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Come out!

848
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Who did this?

849
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Come out!

850
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Come out!

851
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Satria El.

852
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It's been a long time, Professor Purwa.

853
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Until now...

854
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
He hasn't given any news.

855
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
There's a letter.

856
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
We want to invite one of your teachers.

857
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Meet us...

858
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
In the snowy forest at the end of the mountain.

859
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
We want to see you.

860
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
We want to see you.

861
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Meet us...

862
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
In the snowy forest at the end of the mountain.

863
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
From who, Professor?

864
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't know.

865
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
But I'll go there.

866
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'll go with you.

867
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Who did this?

868
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Satria El.

869
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Wait.

870
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Be patient.

871
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
We're not looking for trouble here.

872
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Aldebaran.

873
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Is it true?

874
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You're the one who stole our firecracker?

875
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You want to kiss my cheek?

876
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You're too much.

877
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Don't dream about it.

878
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Professor Aldebaran.

879
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Not me.

880
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Don't lie.

881
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The last person who brought the firecracker...

882
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Was our brother.

883
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Panca.

884
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Panca.

885
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yes.

886
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Panca is my twin sister.

887
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And we heard the news...

888
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That Panca has passed away.

889
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Popo is missing.

890
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And until now...

891
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We haven't found the firecracker that Panca had.

892
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And someone told us...

893
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That the firecracker is now in Silvia's school.

894
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And our assistant, Popo...

895
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Popo.

896
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
He has been made a prisoner.

897
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Calm down.

898
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Be patient.

899
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I will tell you what really happened.

900
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
A few years ago...

901
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I met Panca.

902
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
At that time...

903
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Panca was fighting against the Dark Lord.

904
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
At that time...

905
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I saw that Panca was exhausted.

906
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And almost lost.

907
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And when I tried to help him...

908
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
The wound was too bad.

909
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I couldn't save him.

910
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
To be continued...

911
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
To be continued...

912
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
To be continued...

913
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Keep this.

914
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's very valuable.

915
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So in the end...

916
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Panca gave the firecracker to me.

917
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So I didn't steal the firecracker.

918
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
He gave it to me.

919
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Don't lie to us.

920
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yes.

921
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
How can we believe...

922
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That Panca was killed?

923
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You...

924
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Don't accuse Professor Aldebaran.

925
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
To be continued...

926
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Men...

927
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
They are useless.

928
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Are they patriots?

929
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Or are they cowards?

930
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
They didn't invite us.

931
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
They didn't take us home.

932
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
What should we do?

933
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
We can't give them the firecracker.

934
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
If we give them the firecracker...

935
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
The children will die of cold.

936
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
What should we do?

937
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Should we help them?

938
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I'm worried.

939
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
They will hurt Purwa.

940
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
But I'm sure that Professor Purwa can handle it.

941
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Because he has very high knowledge.

942
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
He's lying.

943
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
We didn't do that.

944
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We didn't steal the firecracker.

945
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
He's a traitor.

946
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
He's behind all of this.

947
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Everything is clear now.

948
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Lita.

949
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You have to make a decision.

950
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Do you want to stay here with me...

951
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Or do you want to go to Samurai?

952
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
To be continued...

953
01:02:48,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Next episode...
