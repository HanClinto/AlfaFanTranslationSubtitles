1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What's this, Prof?

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It seems like someone has changed the tool...

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
into a moving tool.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What has that tool moved?

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Somewhere else.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't know where it is.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I found it, Prof.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Behind the wall.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In the room.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Behind the wall?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The prince of darkness has no mercy.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He even conspired against me.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Drink that, prince.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And get your power.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's that?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Prince of Darkness

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can't do it!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to be treated like my parents.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Dad...

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mom...

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please help me.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Dad...

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Mom...

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Please help me.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Dad...

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mom...

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll help you, Alva.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're all going to fight me.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Go, go, go!

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Go, go, go!

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alva!

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Spaghet, you need to get out of here.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to save you.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go, go, go!

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go, go, go!

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go, go, go!

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Go, go, go!

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Go, go, go!

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You need to get out of here.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, you have to jump now.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on, Mom.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hurry, Alva.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We can't hold on much longer.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hurry!

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Alva, you're the only one who can save Mom.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have to jump now.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're the only one who can fight the Prince of Darkness.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come on, Alva.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hurry!

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Dad...

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mom...

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Dad...

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mom...

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Alva!

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alva!

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Once again, our son succeeded.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Anggara.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How far is the end of this cliff?

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know, sir.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But with a cliff this high, he shouldn't be safe.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The End

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I feel like I'm going to faint.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Where are you going, Fega?

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wait a minute.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I want to ask the Prince of Darkness.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, Fega.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can't you see?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The teachers are busy.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not good to disturb them.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But you know you're in danger.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You have to be strong.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're right.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you want to come with us?

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Rita, do you want to come with us?

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Here, hold this.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But what about Tole?

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just leave him alone.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's wrong, kids?

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why aren't you sleeping?

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We can't sleep.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We're thinking about Alva.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, right.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Soldiers.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Can you fix this telescope?

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The clothes are wrinkled.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's badly damaged.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We can't fix it.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Professor Purwa.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Is it possible for you to fix this?

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's none of your business.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's one person who can do it.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
His name is Panji.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's a magician.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But his residence is very far from here.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In Semak Forest.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's okay, Professor.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Even though it's far, the important thing is that the telescope can be fixed.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes, because we want to find Alva.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Semak Forest is a dangerous place.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There are ball monsters there.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Ball monsters can devour anything.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They can absorb your fear.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We're not afraid, Professor.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We'll keep fighting.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Because we want to save Alva.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right, guys?

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We're not afraid.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're true friends.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Friends who are always there when you're in trouble.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're always there when you're in pain.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm amazed and proud of you.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Professor.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Allow me to accompany these children...

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
...to go to that dangerous forest.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't, Megantara.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I need your help to build this school.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
To help the teachers.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We're not afraid, Tentara.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We'll go alone.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The important thing is that we're always together.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Right, guys?

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you sure?

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Professor.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll train them first.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The spell to destroy the ball monsters.

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Rey, Vega, Belita.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Pay attention.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
As soon as I open this bag...

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
...a monster or something will come out...

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
...that will scare you.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How to avoid being scared?

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's easy.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't be afraid at all.

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Understand?

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
In this lesson...

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
...when you see something scary...

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
...you have to imagine something funny.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You know? Something funny.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Then, recite this spell.

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go, go, Medi.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When you recite this spell...

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
...something that scares you will turn into something funny.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Very funny.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And if you laugh...

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
...the scary monster...

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
...will...

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
...defeat you.

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Understand?

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, sir.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Good.

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
First, I'll give you a chance.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Rey.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What will Rey see...

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
...when she comes out of this bag?

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Barga.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Barga.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why Barga? I'm scared.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Rey, don't be afraid. Just attack.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Barga.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Barga.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Barga.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Where are you, Tara?

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How?

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why am I so scared?

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I told you.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Imagine something funny.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Something funny.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why is it so hard to imagine something funny?

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Concentrate.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Medi.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Good, Rey.

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Look.

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Barga and Duta.

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Barga and Duta.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Look.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Barga and Duta.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Where is Duta?

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Success.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You succeeded, Rey.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Good.

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Very good.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Second.

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Now, it's your turn.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay, sir.

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's see.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What will come out of this bag?

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Professor Purwa.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's easy. I'm not scared.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's good.

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Vega.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You challenged me?

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay.

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You will not pass my class.

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I will make sure of that.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, Professor Purwa.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't want to.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't want to miss the class.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't want to miss the class.

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Vega.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
When Professor Purwa came out, you said it's easy.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're not scared.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Now, you're scared.

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Come on.

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Concentrate.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're the smartest in the class.

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can answer difficult questions.

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's go, Vega.

229
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's go.

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What?

231
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're scared.

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're not scared of monsters.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're scared of your grades.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Come on.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Imagine it.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's funny.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Come on.

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Please.

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Imagine it.

240
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Vega.

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's go, Vega.

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Medhi.

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Professor Purwa is a judge.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Professor Purwa is famous for being fierce...

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
...and cruel.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
When he's teaching...

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
...now, he's soft like...

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
...a boneless meat.

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey.

251
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You can't pass.

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You can't pass.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You can't pass.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You can't pass.

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You can't pass.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You can't pass.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You can't pass.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You can't pass.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You can't pass.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Next.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We're pretty boys.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's go forward.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Let's go.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We have to pass.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's open the bag.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What do you think will scare him?

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Concentration.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Rika.

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're a monster.

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You won't have friends.

272
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Listen.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're a kid.

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Join me and be my son.

275
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't want to.

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't want to leave my friends.

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't want to.

278
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Pelita.

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't cry, Pelita.

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Concentration.

281
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Concentrate, Pelita.

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Focus.

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Remember.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Imagine.

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's funny.

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Try to remember.

287
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't think it's funny.

288
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Try to remember.

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Concentration.

290
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Uncle Mendy.

291
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Uncle Mendy.

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is how you become a high school student.

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What a sick, sick, loose, to die.

294
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Like I said, it's for you.

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Remember.

296
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There's a rat eating rice.

297
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Focus and concentration.

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You'll succeed.

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you, soldier.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But remember.

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You have to be careful.

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And come back safely.

303
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't force me.

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't worry.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We'll be safe, soldier.

306
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Ray can make a poem.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Good.

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I can do it too, soldier.

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Pelita.

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can make a poem like Uncle Megantara.

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Listen.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's sweet.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't cry.

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We'll come back, soldier.

315
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's good.

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The most beautiful bird in the sky...

317
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
...is Pelita.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Vega, keep this.

319
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What is it, sir?

320
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a magic lamp.

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
When you're in trouble or lost...

322
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
...you can turn it on.

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And it will bring you back to school.

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, sir.

325
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This is a magic map.

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This map will lead you to your destination.

327
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Keep it well.

328
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You three have to be careful.

329
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Remember.

330
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You have to...

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Focus.

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And concentrate.

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Vega, this is the map.

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Ray.

335
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This is the map.

336
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go, sir.

337
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Kids.

338
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Be careful.

339
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Kids.

340
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Come back soon.

341
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Let's go, sir.

342
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Vega and Pelita are sleeping.

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No.

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Vega, wake them up.

345
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No.

346
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why are they gone?

347
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm jealous.

348
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Look at me.

349
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because I'm in your team.

350
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why did I become one?

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey!

352
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's follow him.

353
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay.

354
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I ran out of magic.

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Why did I fly?

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know.

357
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm flying.

358
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm flying.

359
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm flying.

360
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Wait for me.

361
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Vega.

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Ray.

363
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Pelita.

364
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wait.

365
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Where did they go?

366
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Guys.

367
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We will pass through a forest area.

368
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So, be ready to fly zigzag.

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because there are many tall trees.

370
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay.

371
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay, sir.

372
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's go.

373
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Why are they flying zigzag like that?

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Like they're apologizing.

375
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Tole, you have to be able to do it.

376
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There's a car.

377
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
There's a car.

378
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There's a car.

379
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There's a car.

380
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Ouch.

381
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ouch.

382
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
My head is aching.

383
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It hurts.

384
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Ouch.

385
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Ouch.

386
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I can do it.

387
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I have to fight.

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Wait, sir.

389
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
With these 12 stones,

390
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I will give my soul to 12 people.

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This is mine.

392
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Those who dare to challenge me.

393
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
To be continued...

394
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
NEXT EPISODE

395
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's changing.

396
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go.

397
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Guys.

398
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Guys.

399
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Now, we have arrived at Semak Forest.

400
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Are you scared, Rey?

401
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No, I'm not.

402
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm not scared.

403
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
If I'm scared, why would I follow you?

404
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Let's go.

405
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Wait, sir.

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I think we have to split up.

407
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I will go to the right with Vega.

408
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You will go to the left alone.

409
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What do you think?

410
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's split up.

411
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Why do we have to split up?

412
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm scared.

413
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm going to die in the forest.

414
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Ouch.

415
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Ouch.

416
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Mom.

417
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Ouch.

418
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Ouch.

419
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Rey!

420
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Vega!

421
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Kelita!

422
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Don't do that!

423
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
There are so many of you.

424
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
To be continued...

425
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Maybe, this is the 8th floor.

426
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I have to get out of here.

427
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ouch, it hurts.

428
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Thank God, you're awake.

429
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
To be continued...

430
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What's wrong?

431
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If you don't want to drink, it's okay.

432
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But don't blame me if you're getting drunk.

433
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
To be continued...

434
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
To be continued...

435
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
My body can't take it anymore.

436
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's good.

437
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Whose house is this?

438
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Sir, who are you?

439
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And where am I?

440
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
To be continued...

441
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
This is my house.

442
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I saw you in the forest.

443
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And it looks like you came from a high place.

444
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes.

445
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Someone is mean to me.

446
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Don't move!

447
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Covering light!

448
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Alpha!

449
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You better get out of here.

450
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You have to get out of here now.

451
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Sir, let's go.

452
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Hurry up, Alpha.

453
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We can't hold on any longer.

454
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's why I jumped off the cliff.

455
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Where are you from?

456
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm from Sihir School.

457
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Do you know the way back to Sihir School?

458
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I want to go home.

459
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm sorry, I don't know.

460
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I can't help you.

461
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Because I can't leave this place.

462
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
How about this?

463
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
For now, you stay here until you get better.

464
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
After you get better, I'll give you a map.

465
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And you can continue your journey home.

466
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yes, sir.

467
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Just think of this house as your own.

468
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Take whatever you want.

469
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But there's one thing I want.

470
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
There's a hut next to this house.

471
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
With a black door.

472
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You can't go in there without any reason.

473
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yes, sir.

474
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I promise.

475
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Good.

476
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Hold this.

477
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Who is this guy?

478
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
He looks nice.

479
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But why is he living in this scary house?

480
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And there are so many ghosts.

481
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Where are you going?

482
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
To be continued....

483
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm so scared.

484
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What if someone is waiting for me?

485
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What is that?

486
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Let's go.

487
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Let's go.

488
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What are you doing?

489
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'll report you to the police.

490
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Come here.

491
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Come here.

492
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Why are you so lazy to study?

494
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You only think about eating.

495
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You're such a coward.

496
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That's enough.

497
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You're a coward.

498
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You're a coward.

500
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's Tole's voice.

501
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I heard it too.

502
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But it's impossible that Tole is here.

503
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Maybe he's in a trap.

504
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But I'm sure that Tole's voice is clear.

505
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think this is Tole's voice.

506
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That's right.

507
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's go.

508
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's go.

509
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I heard Tole's voice.

510
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Let's go.

511
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm going to sleep.

512
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So, I can recover faster.

513
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Let us go.

514
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Let us go.

515
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Whose voice is that?

516
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Let us go.

517
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Let us go.

518
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Let us go.

519
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Let us go.

520
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Help.

521
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Let us go.

522
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let us go.

523
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Don't hurt us.

524
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Please, let us go.

525
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Help.

526
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Let us go.

527
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Let us go.

528
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Don't hurt us.

529
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Please, let us go.

530
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Where are you going?

531
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Sir.

532
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I heard someone asking for help.

533
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
From the door.

534
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Maybe it's just your hallucination.

535
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You should go back to your room.

536
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Get some rest.

537
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So, you can recover faster.

538
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Is it just my hallucination?

539
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I think I heard something.

540
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Okay.

541
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm going back to my room.

542
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm going back to my room.

543
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Did you hear that?

544
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes, I heard it too.

545
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I think it's coming from there.

546
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Let's go.

547
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You have to learn.

549
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Don't just think about eating.

550
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No.

551
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

552
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

553
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

554
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Who is that?

555
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Why is Tole scared of him?

556
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It must be the ball monster.

557
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Tole, don't cry.

558
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Rih, Pegah, Lita.

559
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Tole, you have to concentrate.

560
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You have to talk to that person.

561
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And use Medi's mantra.

562
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Hurry up.

563
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't want to.

564
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I don't want to attack my mom.

565
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That's not your mom, Tole.

566
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That's the ball monster.

567
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That's right, Lita.

568
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You have to focus.

569
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And use Medi's mantra.

570
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Come on.

571
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Concentrate.

572
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You can do it.

573
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Imagine if your mom is funny.

574
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You can do it.

575
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Come on.

576
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Hurry up. Concentrate.

577
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Use Medi's mantra.

579
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
To be continued...

580
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The ball is gone.

581
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The ball is gone.

582
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Where did it go?

583
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The ball is gone.

584
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
What are you doing here?

585
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Me?

586
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm here to pick you up.

587
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I want to come with you.

588
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Are you scared of me?

589
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You were sleeping last night.

590
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yes, I was.

591
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You were still sleeping last night.

592
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Where were you?

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Why?

594
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I just woke up.

595
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
What are we going to do now?

596
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I don't know.

597
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We're going to Mr. Panji's house.

598
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He can fix our telescope.

599
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The broken one.

600
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That's right. Let's go.

601
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Let's go.

602
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm bored in my room.

603
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
What should I do?

604
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, right.

605
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
He helped me.

606
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I should help him.

607
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But...

608
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What should I do with the broken one?

609
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's broken.

610
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Trash!

611
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
To be continued...

612
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm so tired.

613
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Trash!

614
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's clean.

615
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It looks neat.

616
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That means, I'm happy.

617
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Help!

618
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Let us go!

619
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Let us go!

620
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Let us go!

621
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Please, let us go!

622
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That voice again.

623
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I think I know that voice.

624
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But why don't I know it?

625
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It looks like they're rebuilding the school, sir.

626
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
We have to stop them.

627
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
To be continued...

628
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I think I know that voice.

629
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But why don't I know it?

630
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
To be continued...

631
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
If I open this door, he'll be mad.

632
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Please, don't!

633
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Don't kill me!

634
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Go!

635
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Go away!

636
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That voice again.

637
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I think he's asking for help.

638
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I have to help him.

639
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Should I pay him?

640
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I have to help him.

641
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Good morning, kids.

642
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Good morning, sir.

643
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Today, the teachers and I...

644
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
will rebuild the school...

645
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
that was destroyed by the explosion yesterday.

646
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And this school's renovation...

647
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
will take a lot of time and effort from the teachers.

648
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
For the next 12 hours,

649
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
we, the teachers, will concentrate on the school's renovation.

650
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And as long as the process goes on,

651
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
it can't be stopped.

652
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
We ask you...

653
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
to always be vigilant.

654
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Always guard the school.

655
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
In every corner, keep an eye on everything.

656
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Don't let anyone...

657
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
enter the school.

658
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Do you understand?

659
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yes, sir.

660
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And while we prepare the energy,

661
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Professor Titan will teach you...

662
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
the Totok Mantra to fight evil.

663
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You have to focus and concentrate.

664
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We have to fight together for our school.

665
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yes, sir.

666
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
What magic trick are we going to learn, sir?

667
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Give me a smile.

668
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
We're going to learn a magic trick...

669
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
without using tongs.

670
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Without using tongs?

671
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
How can we use tongs?

672
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yes, sir.

673
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
What do we do, sir?

674
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You just found out.

675
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Now, keep your tongs...

676
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Every creature has a weak spot.

677
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It's around the neck,

678
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
the waist,

679
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and the feet.

680
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Do you understand?

681
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Give me a smile.

682
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Check this out.

683
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Do you understand?

684
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Give me a smile.

685
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Check this out.

686
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Try attacking me.

687
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Are you sure, sir?

688
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Don't be rude.

689
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Yes, Jack.

690
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yes, sir.

691
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Sir, help me.

692
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Sir.

693
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Help me, sir.

694
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
To open the Totok Mantra,

695
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
you just have to press...

696
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
one of the points of the thumb.

697
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Do you understand?

698
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes, sir.

699
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Now, you have to try...

700
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
to find your partner.

701
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Do you understand?

702
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes, sir.

703
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Now, try to find your partner.

704
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Are you ready?

705
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
One, two, three.

706
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
There's a boss.

707
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Help me.

708
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
He's gone.

709
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Help me, boss.

710
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Try to press it.

711
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Why can't I do it?

712
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Try to step back.

713
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Let me teach you.

714
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Like this, Tommy.

715
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Don't play around.

716
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Are you ready?

717
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Let's build our school.

718
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Pembangkali!

719
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Pembangkali!

720
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It looks like they're building another school, sir.

721
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Stop them, Angkar.

722
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Raptor.

723
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Let's try to catch them.

724
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Hurry.

725
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Let's finish this.

726
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Where are you going?

727
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This forest is dangerous.

728
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You shouldn't play here.

729
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We're going to this forest...

730
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
because we're looking for a resident here.

731
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
His name is Mr. Panji. Do you know him?

732
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yes, I do.

733
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't want to get involved.

734
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I still want to live. Excuse me.

735
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
What does he mean?

736
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Why is he going?

737
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't know.

738
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Let's keep looking.

739
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Where are you going?

740
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I need to help him.

741
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
What's that?

742
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'm locking it.

743
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
To be continued...

744
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Help!

745
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Help!

746
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Professor!

747
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Can I help you for a moment?

748
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Yes, Gantara.

749
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The school's repair process has begun.

750
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
If we stop it now, everything will be in vain.

751
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I told you not to come near this cave...

752
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
let alone open the door and go inside.

753
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But what happened?

754
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You've broken my advice...

755
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and you've broken your own promise.

756
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
No.

757
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I heard a voice asking for help.

758
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Actually...

759
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
who is it?

760
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's none of your business.

761
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
If there's someone out there,

762
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
it's my business.

763
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's my business to keep people safe.

764
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Actually, who are you?

765
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Why are you looking for someone like that?

766
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I don't want to be...

767
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
a bad person.

768
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
If I'm a bad person,

769
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
why would I save you?

770
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
If you can't follow my orders,

771
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
please leave.

772
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Leave and never come back!

773
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But...

774
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I said leave!

775
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I think that person is really creepy.

776
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But...

777
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
whatever.

778
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's better if I go home now.

779
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
A few days later...

780
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This house is scary.

781
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yes.

782
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
There are so many monsters.

783
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So many.

784
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
A few days later...

785
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Come in.

786
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Excuse me.

787
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Sir.

788
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yes, what is it?

789
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Is this really Mr. Panji's house?

790
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes.

791
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I want to ask for help.

792
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Can you fix this telescope?

793
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I can.

794
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But I don't want to fix it.

795
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
All of you leave now.

796
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Help!

797
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Help!

798
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Help!

799
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Stop!

800
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Help!

801
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Help!

802
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We have to help him!

803
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But how?

804
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
A few days later...

805
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
No way.

806
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't help him.

807
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
But luckily he didn't manage to get in this room.

808
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I have to change the key.

809
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The key to the painting.

810
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
From now on...

811
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
if you want to open this door,

812
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
you have to tell me.

813
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Alfa.

814
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Alfa.

815
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
This is the key.

816
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Alfa.

817
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Alfa.

818
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Alfa.

819
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Alfa.

820
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Alfa.

821
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Alfa.

822
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Alfa.

823
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
This is your food for the day.

824
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The door has a mantra.

825
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
In the name of your child.

826
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
To be continued...

827
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Please don't kill us.

828
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Please.

829
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Please.

830
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Please don't kill us.

831
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
To be continued...

832
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Help!

833
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Guys, we have to help Jack.

834
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
We can't leave him behind.

835
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But how? The monster is so tall.

836
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Don't forget, you can fly.

837
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Use the poppy oil.

838
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Okay, Nick.

839
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Get ready.

840
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Fly!

841
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Boss!

842
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Boss!

843
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Help!

844
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Help us, Boss!

845
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Get ready to attack.

846
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Attack!

847
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Help us, Boss!

848
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Attack!

849
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Attack!

850
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Attack!

851
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Attack!

852
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Attack!

853
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Tommy, help Jack.

854
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Jack.

855
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Jack, Boss.

856
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Help!

857
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Help!

858
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Jack!

859
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Jack!

860
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Come on!

861
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yes!

862
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Thank you, Boss.

863
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Bye.

864
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Wait!

865
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Hurry up!

866
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
To be continued...

867
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I have to watch the recruits.

868
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Watch out, Nick!

869
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Watch out, Nick!

870
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Watch out, Nick!

871
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Watch out, Nick!

872
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Attack!

873
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Watch out, Nick!

874
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Professor.

875
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Can I help Nick for a moment?

876
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Don't, Megantara.

877
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
We have to focus.

878
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
The school is on fire.

879
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But Nick looks injured, Professor.

880
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Megantara, Nick is a strong boy.

881
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He can handle this.

882
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
We have to trust the kids.

883
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We have to be sure...

884
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
that they can do this.

885
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
What's your next plan, sir?

886
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I want revenge...

887
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
on the people who destroyed this school.

888
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And the first one...

889
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
is me.

890
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
What should I do, sir?

891
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
We will do...

892
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
a big attack.

893
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Get ready.

894
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
To be continued...

895
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Sir.

896
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
What's wrong with him?

897
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
He's under attack.

898
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Attack?

899
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
What attack?

900
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Judging from the attack...

901
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
it looks like a monster attack.

902
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Let's hurry.

903
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Monster?

904
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Don't tell me...

905
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Help!

906
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Help!

907
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Help!

908
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Is this a monster attack?

909
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yes, sir.

910
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Don't go to the house in the middle of the forest.

911
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
The owner is raising monsters.

912
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Be careful, sir.

913
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Help!

914
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Help!

915
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Help!

916
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Help!

917
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
The house in the middle of the forest?

918
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Don't tell me...

919
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
that's your house?

920
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Guys.

921
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
While Raptor is chasing Tommy, Jack and Mike,

922
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
let's attack them from the side.

923
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I told you not to fight.

924
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That's why you don't have to fight.

925
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
What's wrong with you?

926
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You're so mean.

927
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I told you this is for fishing.

928
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So, don't fight.

929
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
To be continued...

930
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Don't stop. Go, go, go.

931
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Never stop. Go, go, go.

932
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Fight with all your might.

933
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Go, go, go.

934
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Make yourself proud. Go, go, go.

935
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Let's dream. Go, go, go.

936
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
We'll make it.
