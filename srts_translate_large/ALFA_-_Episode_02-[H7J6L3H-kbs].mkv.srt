00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To be continued...

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What are you doing to my sister?

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm here to see you.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have my permission.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No one can stop you.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Good afternoon, children.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wow, you can make the hat.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Wow, it's so cool.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't you dare to enter this room.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alfa entered the secret room and met the third-in-command.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What we fear will happen.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's going on?

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's going on?

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Children, calm down.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's going on?

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm here, ma'am.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There's a demon who managed to enter.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Is it the food of the children?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, ma'am.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't make noise.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's better if you don't come out now.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And don't come out before I order you.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do you understand?

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Come on.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you see Vega?

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Vega.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Vega.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where are you?

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I was with Vega.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He said he wanted to go to the bathroom.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ma'am, don't.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We can't go out with him.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He's safe.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But he's our friend.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What if something happens to him?

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's dangerous.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ma'am, wait.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What's going on?

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's going on?

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No!

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you mean?

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's huge!

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Why is it so small?

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ma'am!

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ma'am!

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ma'am!

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Ma'am!

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ma'am!

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Ma'am!

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's going on?

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's go.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go.

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's go.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Fire.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Murder.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Where are we going?

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's go.

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Help!

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hurry up.

64
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ma'am.

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Vega, run!

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Run!

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You!

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
My family.

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let the kid go.

70
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's go.

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's go.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go.

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let's go.

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's going on?

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's going on?

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's go.

77
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's go.

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Fire.

79
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Murder.

80
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's go.

81
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Where are you?

82
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Mr. Fitir.

83
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Fire.

84
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Fire.

85
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Murder.

86
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Fire.

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Lolipop.

88
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The teeth can kill.

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But you can kill it through the teeth.

90
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Concentrate.

91
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Use your Lolipop.

92
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Fire.

93
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Murder.

94
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's go.

95
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Murder.

96
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's go.

97
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Alva.

98
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Thank you, Alva.

99
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's not your fault anymore.

100
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're the only one who can do this.

101
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why me, Professor?

102
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Alva.

103
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Promise me.

104
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't tell anyone.

105
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't tell anyone.

106
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't tell anyone.

107
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Promise me.

108
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't tell anyone.

109
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't tell anyone.

110
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Don't tell anyone.

111
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't tell anyone.

112
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If you've defeated the monster.

113
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Now.

114
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Go back to the safe house.

115
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let your friends handle this.

116
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The monster.

117
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What do we do?

118
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Barga is a very strong monster.

119
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's the hand of the 8th prince.

120
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The only one who can defeat him...

121
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
...is the 8th prince...

122
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
...and a chosen child.

123
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Who is he?

124
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Alva.

125
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He's the chosen child.

126
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The daughter of Gamar and Akira.

127
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
She will be our saviour.

128
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's why...

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
...we have to protect her.

130
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Train her...

131
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
...with all our abilities.

132
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So that when the time comes...

133
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
...Alva can fight the 8th prince.

134
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Agni.

135
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Please keep this a secret.

136
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't let anyone know...

137
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
...that the chosen child is in this school.

138
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If anyone finds out...

139
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
...the 8th prince...

140
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
...will find out sooner than we think.

141
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes, sir.

142
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We're both...

143
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
...ready to be sworn.

144
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I swear.

145
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Where's the monster?

146
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Where's the monster?

147
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Where's the monster?

148
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Where's the monster?

149
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Where's the monster?

150
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Calm down, Ray.

151
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There's no monster here.

152
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's right.

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But I was in Gamar.

154
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Weren't we fighting the monster?

155
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's right.

156
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But you fainted.

157
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And?

158
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And?

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Where's the monster now?

160
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Where's the monster now?

161
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Who's the other one?

162
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There he is.

163
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hey, Pegah.

164
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't go in there.

165
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm curious.

166
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I woke up in Gamar.

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But you fainted.

168
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And the teachers...

169
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
...and Professor Aldebaran...

170
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
...came.

171
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Professor Aldebaran is the monster?

172
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's right.

173
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So, you're the monster.

174
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Professor Aldebaran was fighting...

175
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
...and you're the monster.

176
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
As long as Professor Aldebaran is here...

177
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
...we're safe.

178
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's right.

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why am I here?

180
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Thank God.

181
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Both of you are awake.

182
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Professor Adi.

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Where's the monster?

184
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Calm down, Professor Purwa.

185
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The monster is defeated.

186
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So, the Dark Lord is here.

187
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Because only he can defeat it.

188
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Calm down, Professor Purwa.

189
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The Dark Lord is not here.

190
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But...

191
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
...the chosen one has defeated him.

192
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Who is he?

193
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But I promised not to tell anyone.

195
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Clearly...

196
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
...the chosen one is among our students here.

197
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Alva?

198
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Alva?

199
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Alva?

200
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Alva?

201
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Alva?

202
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Alva.

203
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You have to protect the Stone of Eternity in this school.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What is the Stone of Eternity?

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The Stone of Eternity is a very strong stone.

206
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That stone cannot fall into the wrong hands.

207
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You have to protect that stone.

208
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But how do I protect it?

209
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Protect it with your heart, Alva.

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Why do you know about this school?

211
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And you know my name?

212
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Who are you?

213
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
One day, you will know who we really are.

214
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hey!

215
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Who are you?

216
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hey!

217
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Who are you?

218
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Hey!

219
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What is it?

220
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I had a weird dream.

221
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What dream?

222
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This.

223
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Help me.

224
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What is it?

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I was visited by someone.

226
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And that person is really nice.

227
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I can feel it.

228
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They love me.

229
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And the strangest thing is...

230
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
they told me to protect the Stone of Eternity in this school.

231
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The Stone of Eternity?

232
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What is that?

233
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I've never heard of it.

234
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Maybe it's just a dream.

235
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm going to sleep. I'm sleepy.

236
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Wait!

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The dream is real.

238
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's real.

239
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The person in the dream must be serious.

240
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Who is the person in your dream?

241
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know. I don't know.

242
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
How about this?

243
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Let's ask Centara tomorrow.

244
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Maybe she knows.

245
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Where is Centara?

246
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There she is.

247
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Really?

248
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's go.

249
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Centara.

250
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What is the Stone of Eternity?

251
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The Stone of Eternity...

252
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
is the stone that guards the three-headed dragon.

253
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So, the Stone of Eternity really exists?

254
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Alva.

255
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You...

256
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
How do you know the Stone of Eternity?

257
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You're just in the first grade.

258
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You don't know that yet.

259
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Over there.

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm busy cooking for the three-headed dragon.

261
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So, the three-headed dragon...

262
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
likes rendang, gudeg, and asinan.

263
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This.

264
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This is my cooking.

265
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I love eating gudeg, asinan, and rendang.

266
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm hungry. Don't disturb me.

267
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Over there.

268
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Let's go.

269
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Gosh.

270
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
My mouth.

271
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't keep my mouth shut.

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There's a stone behind the dragon.

273
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And the dragon guards the stone.

274
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What's so special about the stone?

275
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't know.

276
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
To be continued...

277
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
To be continued...

278
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
To be continued...

279
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't you dare to eat...

280
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
or do anything...

281
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
during my lesson.

282
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You all know that.

283
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The students have entered our school.

284
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And for that, there's a new rule that will be applied.

285
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
After 8 p.m.

286
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
All students are forbidden to leave the classroom.

287
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And if anyone steps...

288
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the perpetrator will be punished.

289
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And one classroom will be punished.

290
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Do you understand?

291
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes, sir.

292
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Good.

293
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Now I'm going to teach you a new spell...

294
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
that you can use...

295
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
to take other things.

296
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Pay attention.

297
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Rafaatong Buku.

298
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Rafaatong Buku.

299
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Rafaatong Buku.

300
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Rafaatong Buku.

301
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Rafaatong Buku.

302
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Now...

303
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
focus.

304
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And you all try.

305
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Start.

306
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Rafaatong Buku.

307
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Rafaatong Buku.

308
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Rafaatong Buku.

309
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Rafaatong Buku.

310
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Rafaatong Buku.

311
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Rafaatong Buku.

312
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Rafaatong Buku.

313
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's so cool!

314
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Rafaatong Buku!

315
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Rafaatong Buku.

316
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Rafaatong Buku.

317
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Rafaatong Buku.

318
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Alva.

319
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You are to clean this page.

320
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
How long do you need?

321
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Three hours, Prof.

322
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Living in this world is not as easy as living in the real world.

323
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You have three minutes to clean this page.

324
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And you have to finish it.

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Do you understand?

326
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Three minutes.

327
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Prof.

328
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I think, Prof.

329
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
For Alva's size,

330
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the punishment is too heavy.

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This is still in my class.

332
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So I have the right to decide anything for the students' education.

333
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I forgot, Prof.

334
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
If so, please continue.

335
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Thank you.

336
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Alva.

337
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Do as I say.

338
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If you can't finish it,

339
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
your punishment will be heavier.

340
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Three.

341
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Two minutes and 59 seconds.

342
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Two minutes and 58 seconds.

343
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Tukang Sekotong.

344
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Tukang Lemper.

345
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
There's a ripe fruit.

346
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm hungry.

347
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll try it.

348
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm sure it's delicious.

349
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Dafatong Buah.

350
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Dafatong Buah.

351
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yes.

352
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm hungry.

353
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Dafatong Buah.

354
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, yes.

355
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I've learned the Mantra Bindai Menda.

356
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's a good idea.

357
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I can use the mantra for this punishment.

358
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Let's try.

359
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Dafatong Ketas Kecil.

360
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Dafatong Karti.

361
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Dafatong Karti.

362
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Dafatong Jokri.

363
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's heavy.

364
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I did it.

365
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I've finished it.

366
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Three.

367
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Two.

368
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
One.

369
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Three.

370
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Two.

371
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
One.

372
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Three.

373
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Two.

374
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
One.

375
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Three.

376
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Two.

377
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
One.

378
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Three.

379
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Four.

380
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Five.

381
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Six.

382
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Seven.

383
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Eight.

384
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Nine.

385
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Ten.

386
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Eleven.

387
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Twelve.

388
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Thirteen.

389
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Fourteen.

390
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Fifteen.

391
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Sixteen.

392
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Seventeen.

393
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Eighteen.

394
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Nineteen.

395
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Twenty.

396
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Twenty-one.

397
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Twenty-two.

398
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Twenty-three.

399
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Twenty-three.

400
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Twenty-three.

401
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Twenty-three.

402
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Twenty-three.

403
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Twenty-three.

404
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Twenty-three.

405
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Twenty-three.

406
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Twenty-three.

407
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Twenty-three.

408
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Twenty-three.

409
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Twenty-three.

410
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Twenty-three.

411
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Twenty-three.

412
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Twenty-three.

413
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Twenty-three.

414
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Twenty-three.

415
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You have to answer my question.

416
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Who's the chosen one?

417
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I can't answer, Prof.

418
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Because my mouth has been swore by the mantra to tell anyone.

419
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I see.

420
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Now you have to do what I ask you to do.

421
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because you know who the chosen one is.

422
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You have to be able to order the chosen one...

423
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
...to enter the secret room...

424
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
...and take the stone to his body.

425
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yes, Prof.

426
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
One more thing.

427
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You have to lead the chosen one to take the stone to his body.

428
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Alva, we want to help you with the punishment.

429
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yes.

430
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Do we still need to do it?

431
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
No.

432
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The punishment is over.

433
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Why is it so fast?

434
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes.

435
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
How is it possible?

436
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Alva, come to my room now.

437
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Why?

438
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Because you're smart.

439
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You know everything.

440
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But I don't know everything.

441
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Let's find out.

442
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Alva, I called you because you have to do something for me.

443
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Tonight.

444
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Before the sun rises, you have to go back to the secret room...

445
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
...and take the Stone of Eternity for me.

446
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Isn't that forbidden?

447
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This school is in danger, Alva.

448
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And only the Stone of Eternity can save us all.

449
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But why do I have to take the stone?

450
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Because you have defeated Vargas.

451
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The monster will come back to life when the sun rises.

452
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But how, ma'am?

453
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
There's a Triceratops over there.

454
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And it's very strong.

455
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I will tell you about the Triceratops.

456
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
300 years ago.

457
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
300 years ago.

458
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There were three great warriors.

459
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They loved their heroes so much.

460
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
They gave them their favorite food.

461
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Until one day...

462
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
...the great Triceratops...

463
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
...came back to life.

464
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The great Triceratops...

465
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
...came back to life.

466
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The great Triceratops...

467
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
...came back to life.

468
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Until one day...

469
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
...they were faced by the Dark Lord's army.

470
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The Dark Lord's army.

471
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And they were defeated.

472
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The Dark Lord's army was defeated.

473
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Ashifa and Daini died.

474
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The Triceratops felt very lonely...

475
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
...because they lost their master.

476
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The cry of the Triceratops...

477
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
...lit up the darkness.

478
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This caused the three Triceratops to unite...

479
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
...and form a powerful army.

480
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So, the three Triceratops...

481
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
...can eat the same food as their master?

482
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I saw the army cooking three different foods.

483
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Is that true for the Triceratops?

484
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's true, Alfa.

485
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I've told you everything.

486
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Now, it's up to you to decide...

487
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
...whether you want to be a Triceratops or not.

488
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Now, it's up to you.

489
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You're the only one who can take the Stone of Eternity...

490
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
...and save our lives.

491
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
To be continued...

492
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
To be continued...

493
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's 6 o'clock.

494
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Now, we have to make three different foods...

495
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
...that the Triceratops likes.

496
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That is, rendang, udang, and asinan.

497
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The Triceratops is afraid of us.

498
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So, we have to burn the Stone of Eternity.

499
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That means we have to go to the kitchen.

500
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That's it. Let's go.

501
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Professor!

502
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Who's there?

503
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Come out!

504
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I said, come out or I'll have to use magic.

505
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
One.

506
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Two.

507
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Professor Purwa.

508
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I want to talk to you.

509
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Can you give me a chance?

510
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay.

511
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
One.

512
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Two.

513
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Three.

514
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Four.

515
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Five.

516
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Six.

517
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Seven.

518
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Eight.

519
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Nine.

520
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Ten.

521
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Eleven.

522
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Twelve.

523
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Thirteen.

524
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Fourteen.

525
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Hurry up. Let's cook.

526
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Okay.

527
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Be careful.

528
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Help me.

529
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The Triceratops

530
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Come on, Sar.

531
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Come on.

532
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
The Triceratops

533
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's like someone's cooking.

534
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Who's in there?

535
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The Triceratops

536
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The Triceratops

537
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's heavy.

538
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Be careful.

539
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
The Triceratops

540
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The Triceratops

541
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
The Triceratops

542
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Rey, Vega.

543
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The Triceratops doesn't like this food.

544
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And it's getting worse.

545
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You have to defend yourself.

546
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So I can face it.

547
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay.

548
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Let's go.

549
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
The Triceratops

550
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The Triceratops

551
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's so scary.

552
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Be careful. It can burn your mouth.

553
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Rey, wake up.

554
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It's not blue.

555
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's the Triceratops.

556
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The Triceratops

557
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The Triceratops

558
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The Triceratops

559
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The Triceratops

560
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The Triceratops

561
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Vega!

562
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The Triceratops

563
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Vega!

564
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The Triceratops

565
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The Triceratops

566
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
The Triceratops

567
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
The Triceratops

568
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
The Triceratops

569
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
The Triceratops

570
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The Triceratops

571
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The Triceratops

572
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The Triceratops

573
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The Triceratops

574
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The Triceratops

575
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The Triceratops

576
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The Triceratops

577
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
The Triceratops

578
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The Triceratops

579
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
The Triceratops

580
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The Triceratops

581
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Rey, wake up.

582
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's not blue.

583
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It's the Triceratops.

584
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The Triceratops can kill you if you don't have the antidote.

585
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
What should we do?

586
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We have to take it to the clinic.

587
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
No, no, no.

588
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Just do your job.

589
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You have to take the Triceratops before the sun sets.

590
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'll take care of it.

591
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But...

592
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It's okay.

593
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
The Triceratops

594
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
The Triceratops

595
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Let's go, Rey.

596
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Alpha.

597
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You have to succeed.

598
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
The Triceratops

599
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The Triceratops

600
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The Triceratops is not ready yet.

601
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You'd better go to the clinic now.

602
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
They are not the Triceratops.

603
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But they are...

604
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The Triceratops' daughter.

605
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Alpha.

606
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Why did you take the Triceratops?

607
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Professor Agni asked me to.

608
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Because this school is in danger.

609
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Only the Triceratops can save this school.

610
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Alpha must be released.

611
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Three more days until the full moon.

612
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And if in the full moon, the Dark Lord gets the Triceratops...

613
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
He will get unlimited power.

614
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And he will destroy this world.

615
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
To be continued...

616
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Go, go, go...

617
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Achieve all your dreams

618
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Go, go, go...

619
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Never stop

620
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Go, go, go...

621
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Fight with all your might

622
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Go, go, go...

623
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Make yourself proud

624
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Go, go, go...

625
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Let's dream

626
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Go, go, go...

627
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
We'll make it
