1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Be proud of yourself!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go! Go! Go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I know everything.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It turns out that you're evil.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're friends with the person who kidnapped me in the cave, right?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And you want to ruin Vega and Alva's wedding, right?

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't want to go with you.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, Vega succeeded...

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
in making the princess realize the meaning of love and sacrifice.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And finally, all this mess ended.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right, Professor.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's the star.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't fail this time.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you for helping me.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I misjudged you.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I hit you too.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
When you landed,

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
they were fighting for you.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, I took you away from there.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't want to hear that excuse again.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why can't you just let it go?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have to get the fallen star.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, the fallen star can go back to the sky when the moon is full.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, I have to protect Selena.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ouch.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What are you doing?

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Where are you going?

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going to Vega's house.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Where are you going? Why are you in a hurry?

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm...

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to Vega's house.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Vega's house?

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Vega's house.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Vega's house?

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to run in the morning.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
To be healthy.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
See you.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wait.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What is it?

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want to tell you.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm a professor.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But, I'm not in a normal class.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm in Menara.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Gosh.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There's a white star.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's strong.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It can be detected.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What should I do?

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
See you.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Bye.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Alva.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's so weird.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He's been like that since yesterday.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Maybe, he has something to hide.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Selena.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wake up, Selena.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wake up.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Selena.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Selena.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Wake up.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sleepy, Alva.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Gosh.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have to stay awake at night.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But, I have to sleep at noon.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, I understand.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But, there's a lesson here.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Gosh.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hurry up.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to move here.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Professor.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why is the lesson in Menara?

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why not in the class?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why?

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Is there a problem for you?

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alva.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you doing here?

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Nothing, professor.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nothing.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I ran in the morning.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't mean to come here.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Kids.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Line up, please.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come in, professor.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Everyone.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Listen.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
As usual.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will teach you...

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
...the magic to defend yourself.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The mantra that we're going to learn today is...

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
...Mantra of Transformation.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Mantra of Transformation.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Mantra of Transformation.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mantra of Transformation.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mantra of Transformation.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Professor Agni will help me.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone, pay attention.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Move.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Move.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Professor Purwa.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think...

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
...you should tie your hair more often.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Quiet, everyone.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now, I'm Professor Purwa.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Professor Purwa.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think we should switch bodies again.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think we should switch bodies again.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I think we should switch bodies again.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
As you can see, kids.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Now, it's time to try.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We'll start with your turn.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Rega.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Tommy.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Go.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Remember the mantra.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And your turn.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Move.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes! I did it!

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Vega's glasses are so cool.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Good.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Tommy and Vega.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Next, it's your turn.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Next, it's your turn.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You'll try.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Alva.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Tole.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's that sound?

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's not anyone's voice, Professor.

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That was...

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
...my voice, Professor.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I saw...

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
...Tole fell.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's why I was like that.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ouch.

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Ouch.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is the last lesson.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Tomorrow, we'll start again.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Alva.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Tole.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tomorrow, it's your turn.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And you have to do it.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If you don't, you'll be judged.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay, Professor.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Luckily, Selena didn't get hurt.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sure she'll be fine.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sure she'll be fine.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sure she'll be fine.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sure she'll be fine.

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sure she'll be fine.

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Luckily, Selena didn't find out.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If not, what should I do?

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sure...

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
...the fallen star girl...

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
...is still in this school.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes, I agree.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's find out through them.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hey.

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What do you want?

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't attack me.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Please.

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Calm down.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We won't hurt you.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We want to give you a present.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A present?

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What present?

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We want to give you this.

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hey.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not that easy.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you want this arrow,

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you have to follow our order.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But, don't make it difficult.

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Please, don't make it difficult.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's easy.

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you know about the fallen star?

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's your mission.

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Find out about the fallen star.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If the fallen star is in this school,

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
let us know.

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And you...

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
...will receive this arrow...

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
...as a reward.

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wow.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's cool, Mona.

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I agree.

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But, how can we find out about the fallen star?

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't know.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's find out.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's easy.

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It turns out that the fallen star is in this school.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I have to get it first.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And give it to the Dark Lord.

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
My arrow.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't use my power.

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I might get hurt.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What's that?

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is my sleeping oil.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
To be continued...

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
To be continued...

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you for helping me.

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But, who are you?

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm Selena.

216
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But, don't tell anyone...

217
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
...that I'm the fallen star.

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Because, only you and Alva know about it.

219
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If others know about it,

220
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
it will be dangerous.

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I promise you.

222
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I won't tell anyone.

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Because, you helped me.

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
With this tool,

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
we can catch the fallen star.

227
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Fallen star.

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't.

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The fallen star is good.

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Not like you.

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's evil.

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Do you know it?

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No.

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No.

235
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't know it.

236
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But, how do you know it?

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't know it.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Where is it?

239
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know it.

240
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Someone must have hidden it.

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think, he knows something.

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's wrong?

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I met Selena just now.

244
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But, don't tell anyone.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
How can it be like that?

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What's wrong?

247
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Nothing.

248
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Felita told me about the fallen star.

249
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

250
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's on the tree.

251
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay.

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I won't bother you.

253
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll go first.

254
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

255
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll go first.

256
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What's wrong with them?

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Why are they so weird?

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know.

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No one is hiding it.

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Here, Felita.

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Sister.

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Sister.

263
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sister.

264
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Sister.

265
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Hi, Felita.

266
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I brought food for you.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Thank you, Felita.

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're welcome.

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes!

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Your work is good.

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It means, we found it.

272
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes.

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Not now.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Wait until we find the fallen star.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

276
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Go back to the school.

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You'll find it.

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Wait.

279
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll go with you.

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Eka.

281
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You have to find it.

282
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There must be something.

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The teachers will warn us.

284
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't be careless.

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Tri.

286
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Find the tool that can help me get into the school.

287
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Wow.

288
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's Megantara.

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're great.

290
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Cool.

291
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Megantara.

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Megantara, have you seen Alva?

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I've been looking for her.

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Mr. Ega has been looking for her too.

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're being a jerk.

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Megantara is not here.

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think Alkrab is with Tommy.

298
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll go with you.

299
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay.

300
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll go with you.

301
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay.

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll go with you.

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay.

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll go with you.

305
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

306
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll go with you.

307
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Sir.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's him.

309
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't lie to me.

310
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How dare you lie to me?

311
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's him.

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Sir, he's lying.

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Sir, he's lying.

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Sir, that's him.

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't play with me.

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
How dare you play with me?

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Take the consequences.

318
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Why can't he see?

319
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He's clearly there.

320
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Tole.

321
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We have to concentrate.

322
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We can do it.

323
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Alva, I'm scared too.

324
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What if he sees us?

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's scary.

326
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We'll be punished.

327
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The punishment will be weird.

328
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We have to clean the toilet.

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We have to clean the page.

330
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Come on, Tole.

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
When are we going to practice?

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What's wrong?

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Vivinda Jiwa.

334
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Salena.

335
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's my body.

336
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This is bad.

337
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Why am I in Salena's body?

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What's going on?

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So, this is where the door fell.

340
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Let me go.

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let me go.

342
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let me go.

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Let me go, Professor Ankara.

344
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you know where I am?

345
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You're a bad person.

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Who doesn't know you?

347
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Let me go.

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Let me go.

349
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let me go.

350
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let me go.

351
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let me go.

352
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Vivinda!

353
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Good evening, sir.

354
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I managed to get Putri Bintang.

355
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why isn't the star shining?

356
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
How can it shine, sir?

357
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
A star should shine when it emits light from its body.

358
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Ankara.

359
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I want you to make the star shine.

360
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Because if the star doesn't shine, it's useless to me.

361
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Make it shine, Ankara.

362
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
After it shines, bring it to the black cave.

363
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I will take its power here.

364
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
How can I make it shine?

365
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Wait!

366
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Gawat, there's Professor Ankara.

367
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
This is Professor Ankara.

368
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I want you to make the star shine.

369
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Wait!

370
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Gawat, there's Professor Ankara.

371
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
How can I be inside the cave?

372
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
This is weird.

373
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What's wrong with me?

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What should I do? I'm not Alva.

375
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Alva!

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Where have you been? We've been looking for you.

377
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm not Alva.

378
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Alva, are you sick?

379
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm not Alva.

380
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What's wrong?

381
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Come here.

382
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Move.

383
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey, let me go.

384
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Let me go.

385
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm Alva.

386
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Alva, you must be sick.

387
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's why you're whining.

388
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Where are you taking me?

389
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I want to go home.

390
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Alva, you must be sick.

391
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's why you're whining.

392
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That's why you're whining.

393
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So, we're taking you to the vet.

394
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Hey, I'm not sick.

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Let me go.

396
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm not Alva.

397
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Do you know that?

398
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm not Alva.

399
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Alva, be patient.

400
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We're almost there.

401
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Let's go.

402
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
To Be Continued...

403
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yes, I know now.

404
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
A star will shine brightly when it's happy.

405
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And it will fade when it's sad.

406
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Stars like to dance and sing.

407
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If I can make it dance and sing...

408
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
...it will be happy...

409
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
...and its body will shine.

410
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yes.

411
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I will succeed this time.

412
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
To Be Continued...

413
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Where am I?

414
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
To Be Continued...

415
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This is bad.

416
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm still in Putri Selena's body.

417
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Putri Selena must be in my body.

418
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
She must be scared.

419
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I have to go back to school.

420
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The key.

421
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
There's a window.

422
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I can't open it.

423
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Why didn't I cut it?

424
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Where is it?

425
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
To Be Continued...

426
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What's that smell?

427
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Why is it me?

428
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Sorry.

429
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Everything is okay.

430
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
No problem.

431
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's very good.

432
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So, I'm fine.

433
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Thank you, doctor.

434
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay. Welcome, beautiful.

435
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Don't get sick.

436
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Tomorrow is the first month.

437
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The teacher told me...

438
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
...that we will play on the first month.

439
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That's right.

440
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Tomorrow is the first month.

441
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I have to get my body back.

442
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
If I don't get my body back...

443
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
...I won't be able to go back to space.

444
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I have to wait for the first month.

445
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Okay, Alva.

446
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I will give you...

447
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
...a calm down mantra.

448
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
A calm down mantra.

449
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So, you won't be scared anymore.

450
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So, you can sleep soundly tomorrow.

451
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We can play.

452
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't want to.

453
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No, Alva.

454
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Don't be naughty.

455
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
This mantra is not dangerous.

456
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Not dangerous.

457
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It can make you sleepy...

458
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
...and sleeping handsome.

459
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Sleep soundly until tomorrow.

460
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Okay, Alva.

461
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I can't sleep.

462
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I have to get my body back.

463
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't want to be late to go back to space.

464
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I don't want to.

465
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's right, baby.

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Okay, Alva.

467
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Are you ready?

468
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No.

469
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Alva.

470
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
What's wrong with Alva?

471
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't know.

472
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Why is she acting weird?

473
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Why?

474
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
She's acting like a ghost.

475
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Let's go.

476
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Thank you, doctor.

477
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You're welcome.

478
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Guys.

479
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Please help me.

480
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I have to go back to school.

481
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Please help me.

482
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Get me out of here.

483
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Why can't they hear me?

484
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I think they're hypnotized.

485
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I have an idea.

486
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Here's the key.

487
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I have to go back to school.

488
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I have to find Selena's real body.

489
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Wait!

490
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Gawat, there's a space probe.

491
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Are the stars shining?

492
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Good.

493
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But...

494
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
if that's a dancer,

495
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
why is she going out by herself?

496
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Maybe I've hypnotized them...

497
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
so that they can dance and sing.

498
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Good.

499
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
She's dancing and singing.

500
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
She must be happy.

501
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But...

502
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
why isn't she shining?

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Maybe...

504
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
she's a ghost.

505
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You!

506
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're not Putri Bintang!

507
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Where's Putri Bintang?

508
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
How dare you play with me?

509
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
What?

510
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We were right.

511
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Anggap is going to meet Selena.

512
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But we're not in the same class.

513
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Let's go after her.

514
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
To be continued...

515
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
To be continued...

516
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You believe me, right?

517
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't believe you.

518
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
No!

519
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Let me go!

520
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Let me go.

521
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm Bintang.

522
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Bintang?

523
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yes.

524
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You're good kids.

525
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Now,

526
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
if you want to let me go,

527
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I have to find out where my body is.

528
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Let's go.

529
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's not safe.

530
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Let's go back.

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes.

532
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Are you Bintang?

533
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's impossible.

534
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The soldier said...

535
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Bintang Jatuh is very rare.

536
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's true.

537
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
If you don't believe me,

538
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
ask Prita.

539
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yesterday,

540
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I met Prita.

541
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Prita,

542
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
are you Bintang Jatuh?

543
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Putri Bintang Jatuh...

544
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
is the one who lives in the school tower.

545
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
She helped me yesterday.

546
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
No.

547
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's you.

548
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't believe you.

549
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's you, Alva.

550
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Anyway,

551
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I didn't know...

554
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I was in Alva's body.

555
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Maybe...

556
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
you switched bodies with Alva.

557
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't know.

558
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
When I jumped to the tower,

559
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I fainted.

560
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
When I realized,

561
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I was trapped in Alva's body.

562
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So, Alva...

563
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
is in her body.

564
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Bintang Jatuh.

565
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Where is she?

566
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I know how to find her.

567
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
If she's really Bintang,

568
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll ask her to shine.

569
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's right.

570
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Alright.

571
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll do it.

572
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
She's shining.

573
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
She's shining.

574
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
She's shining.

575
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
She's shining.

576
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
She's shining.

577
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
She's shining.

578
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's true.

579
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
She's shining.

580
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That means,

581
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
she's Selena.

582
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
See?

583
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I told you.

584
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm Selena,

585
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Bintang Jatuh.

586
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Then?

587
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
If she's not Alva,

588
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
then what is she?

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So, Alva is in...

590
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Selena's body.

591
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Our guess is right.

592
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Alva is in Selena's body.

593
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What should we do?

594
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Let's chase her.

595
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Let me see.

596
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
She's here.

597
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
She's here.

598
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Alva is being chased by Professor Rangkarat.

599
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
What should we do?

600
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Let's help Alva.

601
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Alright.

602
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's good that we can get rid of Professor Rangkarat.

603
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But,

604
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
what should we do?

605
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
What can we do to help her?

606
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
To be continued...

607
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Just like a dream...

608
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
In this heart...

609
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Attack!

610
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There's a bad guy!

611
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Hey!

612
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
There's a bad guy!

613
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hey!

614
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
There's a bad guy!

615
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's okay.

616
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's us.

617
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Vega?

618
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Ray?

619
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Lita?

620
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Why are you guys here?

621
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
How do you know me?

622
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Ray, of course we know you.

623
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
She's Alva's soul.

624
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But, I still don't believe it.

625
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Why is my outfit different?

626
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm not Alva.

627
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm not Alva.

628
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm not Alva.

629
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm not Alva.

630
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm not Alva.

631
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Why is my outfit different?

632
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Where's my outfit?

633
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I changed my outfit.

635
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The dancer's outfit is over there.

636
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But, your outfit...

637
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Selena left it.

638
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Let's talk about it later.

640
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Right now,

641
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
you guys face each other.

642
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And then,

643
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you guys change your souls again.

644
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Give me the cane.

645
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This is your cane, Alva.

646
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Thank you.

647
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Let's change our souls.

648
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Hurry up.

649
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
What's going on?

650
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm back.

651
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You did it.

652
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Thank you, Vega.

653
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Ray, Rita.

654
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
How are you guys?

655
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm back to my body.

656
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Now,

657
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
you're back to your real body.

658
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Star princess.

659
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Yes.

660
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm back to my real body.

661
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Thank you.

662
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You're so nice to me.

663
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You helped me.

664
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So, now,

665
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I just need to pray for a long time.

666
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So, I can go back to the sky.

667
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You have to pray for a long time tomorrow.

668
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So, you can go back to your real body.

669
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I can't meet Selena anymore.

670
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Don't worry.

671
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Later,

672
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
from the sky,

673
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I will summon you.

674
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So, we can play together again.

675
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Promise?

676
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Promise.

677
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Who's that?

678
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm being followed.

679
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I don't know.

680
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Help me.

681
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Who's that?

682
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Help me.

683
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You can't go anywhere, Star princess.

684
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You can't go anywhere, Star princess.

685
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
What's wrong with you?

686
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
What are you doing?

687
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Hey.

688
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Your power is not comparable to Selena's.

689
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm sorry.

692
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm sorry.

693
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Your power is not comparable to me.

700
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We...

701
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Let me go.

702
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Let me go.

703
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Good morning, Alvaro.

704
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Megantara.

705
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And you too.

706
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We can do this.

707
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Help.

708
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Help.

709
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Let me go.

710
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Help.

711
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Let me go.

712
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Help.

713
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Let me go.

714
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Sir.

715
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Star princess is very weak and hot.

716
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I can't tie her.

717
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Even if I tie her, she'll burn.

718
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Don't fight her, Angkara.

719
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Because the peak of Star princess' power is at night.

720
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You can burn with her light.

721
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So,

722
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I have to fight her?

723
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yes.

724
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I have to fight her.

725
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I have to fight her.

726
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I have to fight her.

727
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I have to fight her.

728
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I have to fight her.

729
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So,

730
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
we'll wait until tomorrow.

731
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Tomorrow morning,

732
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I'll get Star princess' power.

733
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And with that power, I'll defeat Aldebaran.

734
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Then,

735
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'll take the chosen one from Aldebaran's protection.

736
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Where are we?

737
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Putri Selena.

738
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Putri Selena.

739
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Where are you?

740
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
She must be taken by Professor Angkara.

741
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Oh, no.

742
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Her heart must be taken.

743
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yes.

744
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Her heart?

745
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Rey,

746
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
if the army is explaining the history of magic,

747
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
you have to listen to them.

748
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
She said,

749
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Star princess is very weak and hot.

750
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Didn't she say,

751
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Star princess is weak because of what?

752
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Because of her hair, eyes, and heart.

753
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They can make a great power.

754
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yes, it's true.

755
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's dangerous if she falls into the hands of a bad spy.

756
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But we can't do it alone.

757
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We need Professor Aldebaran's help.

758
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay.

759
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Let's go.

760
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So,

761
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Star princess is in our school?

762
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Yes, sir.

763
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I asked her to stay at the school's tower.

764
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But because of Professor Angkara,

765
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
she was kidnapped.

766
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Why are you hiding this from me, Alva?

767
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Your actions can endanger yourself

768
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and your other friends.

769
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

770
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Because Star princess told me

771
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
that I can't tell anyone.

772
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So,

773
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I have to keep my promise.

774
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
If so,

775
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
we have to find out

776
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
where they took her.

777
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Use this telescope, Professor.

778
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's morning already.

779
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm scared.

780
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm sleepy.

781
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It's time.

782
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Soon,

783
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
all the power of Star princess

784
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
will belong to the Dark Lord.

785
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Even if it's Aldebaran,

786
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
he can't stop her.

787
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
We have to go there right now.

788
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Before Angkara takes the power from Star princess.

789
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Let's go, Alva.

790
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'll go with you.

791
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
There's a fruit

792
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
that's hard to pick.

793
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It's dangerous.

794
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Don't follow me.

795
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But, sir,

796
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I have to be responsible for this.

797
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'll go with you.

798
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'll go with you.

799
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'll go with you.

800
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'll go with you.

801
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'll go with you.

802
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I'll go with you.

803
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'll go with you.

804
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'll go with you.

805
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'll go with you.

806
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I'll go with you.

807
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'll go with you.

808
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'll go with you.

809
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'll go with you.

810
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
What is the matter, Angkara?

811
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm worried about this.

812
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I promised to Star princess that

813
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'll help her to go back to the sky.

814
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Okay, Alva.

815
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You can go with them.

816
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Thank you, sir.

817
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So, what should we do now, sir?

818
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Well, we...

819
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Don't follow me.

820
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
To be continued...

821
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
To be continued...

822
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Are you ready, Angkara?

823
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes, sir.

824
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You go out, Angkara.

825
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
We have a guest.

826
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's them again.

827
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'll break in.

828
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
We need to break in, sir.

829
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Face them, Angkara.

830
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yes, sir.

831
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I'll fight them for you.

832
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Good morning, Angkara.

833
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Megatara.

834
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And you, Alva.

835
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Give me back Star princess.

836
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It's not that easy, Alva.

837
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And I'm begging you.

838
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Don't ever bother me again.

839
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
To be continued...

840
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Finally.

841
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Star princess's hair is mine.

842
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
To be continued...

843
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Star princess's hair...

844
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
will make me head over heels for you.

845
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
To be continued...

846
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
To be continued...

847
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Star!

848
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Star princess's hair...

849
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
will make me head over heels for you.

850
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Star princess's hair...

851
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
will make me head over heels for you.

852
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
How can I resist this?

853
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
How can I resist this?

854
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
How can I resist this?

855
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
How can I resist this?

856
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
How can I resist this?

857
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
How can I resist this?

858
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
How can I resist this?

859
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
How can I resist this?

860
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Finally.

861
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Star princess's hair is mine.

862
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Now, it's time for me...

863
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
to take Star princess's tears.

864
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Tear of tears.

865
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
With these tears,

866
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
my power will be restored.

867
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Now, it's time for me...

868
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
to take Star princess's heart.

869
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Star princess's heart...

870
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
will be mine.

871
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Duplika!

872
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I must take Star princess's tears now.

873
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
After that,

874
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I will be strong.

875
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You must stop him.

876
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Don't let him drink the tears...

877
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
mixed with my hair.

878
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Because it can cure all his illness.

879
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And he will be stronger.

880
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
To be continued...

881
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
To be continued...
