00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Heart's strength

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Make yourself proud

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go, go, go

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's dream

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Go, go, go

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can do it

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Alva, why did you take that stone?

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Professor Agni asked me to

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because this school is in danger

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Only that stone can save this school

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Three days from now

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He will get unlimited power

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And will destroy this world

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are expelled from school

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is this?

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What is this?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What is this?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Where am I?

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Maybe they want me to follow them

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe they want me to follow them

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't move

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To be continued...

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
To be continued...

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To be continued...

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm running away!

29
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why are you guys here?

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Come on, hurry up!

31
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry, Alva. I don't trust you anymore.

32
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
To be continued...

33
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Alright, if you're still mad at me, it's fate.

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because I was wrong.

35
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To be continued...

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I'm not mad.

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you serious?

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're my friend, right?

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
To be continued...

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
To be continued...

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Alva.

43
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Alva.

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We believe that you're innocent.

45
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's why we prevent you from leaving.

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then, I want to get out of here.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can still go to school, right?

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Unfortunately, only the three of us believe in you.

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, you're still expelled from school.

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's why we have to do this.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We have to clear your name so you can go to school again.

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But, how?

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The way is...

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
we have to catch the person who took the stone.

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's right!

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, that's right!

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The person who slandered you.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The Dark Lord, right?

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Not the Dark Lord.

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But the person ordered by the Dark Lord.

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This person's magic is very powerful, Alva.

63
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's why...

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I will train the three of you...

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
so you can fight him.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Especially you, Alva.

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The Dark Lord's Revenge

68
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The Dark Lord's Revenge

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's so cool!

70
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's so cool!

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Vega.

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Take that stone.

73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then, throw it at me.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But...

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurry!

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Throw it as hard as you can.

77
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now, try my magic.

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, Dark Lord.

79
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Revenge!

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Rey.

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Throw Alva with the apple.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Really, Dark Lord?

83
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Come on, Rey.

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's test Alva's magic.

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Alva.

86
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The magic you made is still too thin.

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's not thick enough.

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You have to concentrate more...

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
in reading my magic.

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Try it again.

92
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll try again.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Throw it as hard as you can.

95
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sorry, bro.

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think...

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
this is enough for today.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We'll continue later.

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No, no.

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, Dark Lord.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I still want to try again.

102
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I have to keep practicing until I can.

103
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't, Alva.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're too tired.

105
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you force yourself,

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
it can be dangerous for you.

107
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come on, Rey.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on.

109
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where are you taking me?

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Alva.

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You have to stay here.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We have to leave here...

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
because we'll be searched.

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay?

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Alva.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If anything happens,

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
just say my name three times.

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But if you don't show up,

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
just run away.

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
At least,

121
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
there's still someone who trusts me.

122
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Um...

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you...

125
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
for helping me.

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We're happy to help you too.

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Right, girls?

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yippee!

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The dragon fruit,

130
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the slush fruit,

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I also want to say...

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
thank you...

133
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for helping me.

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There's another one!

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Attack!

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
To Be Continued...

137
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's so quiet...

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
without Vega and Rey.

139
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have to practice...

140
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
so that I can...

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
To Be Continued...

142
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To Be Continued...

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Ouch.

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It hurts.

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't give up.

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Go, go, go!

147
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Be proud of yourself!

148
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Go, go, go!

149
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's dream!

150
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Go, go, go!

151
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We'll make it!

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
To Be Continued...

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You guys...

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What?

155
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You have to act faster...

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
before it's too late.

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't let the dragon fruit...

158
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
fall to the ground.

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes.

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm looking for that person.

161
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Remember,

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
don't look for anyone...

163
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
other than the dragon fruit.

164
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe you don't know what's inside,

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but what's inside...

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
is not the dragon fruit.

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have to choose carefully.

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Stop!

169
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why do I always dream about them?

170
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But they're right.

171
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have to stop the darkness...

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
from getting that stone.

173
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have to keep practicing.

174
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Police!

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Stop!

176
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Drink that!

177
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Drink it!

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Drink!

179
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Drink that!

180
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Drink it!

181
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What a hero!

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hooray!

183
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah!

184
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We did it!

185
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Well done, Afan!

186
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Perfect!

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That means...

188
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
now...

189
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you can do your research.

190
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes!

191
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Now, let's make Agni sad.

192
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Agreed.

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's not make him sad.

194
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You do it, Afan.

195
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Huh?

196
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You will interrogate Professor Agni...

197
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
by pretending to be Professor Adebaran.

198
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Huh?

199
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hooray!

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hooray!

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Here's the interrogation.

202
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
With this interrogation, you can become Professor Adebaran.

203
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Are you sure?

204
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sure.

205
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I've followed everything in the book.

206
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Prove it.

207
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I want to see the result.

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay.

209
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll prove it.

210
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
All of it.

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Where is it?

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What?

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Now, stand on this cloth.

214
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Huh?

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Wow.

216
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's so cool.

217
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Now, I'm Professor Adebaran.

218
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But, how do we do the interrogation?

219
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There's only one way.

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can't get wet.

221
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you get wet, you will become your original self.

222
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Right, Dara?

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes.

224
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's right.

225
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Remember the rules.

226
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Come in.

227
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Professor Adebaran?

228
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Good afternoon, ma'am.

229
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I mean, Professor.

230
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What is it, Professor?

231
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Is there anything important that made you come to my office?

232
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I came here to ask you...

233
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
if you have any questions.

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What is it that made you come to my office?

235
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm studying self-defense right now.

236
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I need your help to attack me.

237
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Attack you?

238
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes.

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You tried to attack me with a strong mantra.

240
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I fainted.

241
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That mantra is called...

242
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Meriamfang Mantra.

243
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's a black magic.

244
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I've never learned that magic,

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and I can't do it either.

246
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Ouch.

247
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
My hand suddenly hurts, Prof.

248
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let me try, Professor.

249
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ouch, it hurts, Prof. Let me try.

250
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't have a ring?

251
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Where's the ring, Prof?

252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You don't wear a ring.

253
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I've never worn a ring.

254
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry, Prof.

255
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Let me help you.

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, God.

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I forgot.

258
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't get wet.

259
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have to get out of here.

260
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Prof.

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Excuse me.

263
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's a thin blanket.

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Professor, you said you needed my help.

265
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's okay.

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Professor!

267
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Professor Purwa.

268
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Alva.

269
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You've been expelled from this school.

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why are you still here?

271
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Sabin's ring.

272
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Sabin's ring.

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Sabin's ring.

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Sabin's ring.

275
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So, Professor Purwa did it.

276
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The professor who took the ring.

277
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How dare you kill me like that?

278
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Now, come with me.

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We're going to face Professor Aldebaran.

280
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You have to leave this school.

281
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's go.

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How dare you fight me?

283
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Alva.

284
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Alva.

285
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Where are you?

286
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Where are you?

287
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Professor.

288
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Alva.

289
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Alva.

290
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Alva.

291
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Alva.

292
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Alva.

293
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Where do you think you're going?

294
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Get out.

295
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Alva.

296
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can't run anymore, Alva.

297
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Stay there.

298
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What's that?

299
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Where is he?

300
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Where is he?

301
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He was here.

302
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I think Professor Purwa can't see me.

303
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is it because of this ring?

304
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Alva.

305
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's true. He can't see me.

306
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We can do it.

307
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We can do it.

308
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Alva, where are you?

309
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's been a long time.

310
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I want to sleep.

311
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It hurts.

312
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It hurts.

313
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Alva.

314
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Alva.

315
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Alva.

316
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Alva.

317
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Alva.

318
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Alva.

319
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What are you doing, Rey?

320
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Why are you fighting?

321
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What did I do to you?

322
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Don't pretend.

323
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Who's pretending?

324
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Stop it.

325
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You've been fighting.

326
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's noisy.

327
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Calm down.

328
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's more comfortable.

329
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's more safe.

330
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Gosh.

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Both of you are mad.

332
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How dare you hit my ears?

333
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Here, Tendara.

334
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Stop it.

335
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No, Tendara.

336
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Stop fighting.

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Alva.

338
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Alva.

339
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
When did you come?

340
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because I'm wearing this.

341
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Try it.

342
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
If we wear it, we won't be seen.

343
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is a magic wand.

344
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Where did you get this?

345
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Suddenly, this wand fell from the sky.

346
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
When I was chased, Prof. Purwa was locked in a labyrinth.

347
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Thanks to this wand, I'm safe.

348
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I know who stole the stone.

349
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Who?

350
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Prof. Purwa.

351
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He's a man wearing a cow's moon ring.

352
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He's the one who chased me until I fainted.

353
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And he took the stone.

354
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are you sure?

355
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes.

356
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I saw him wearing the ring.

357
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sure.

358
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He must be the culprit.

359
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Don't say anything if there's no evidence.

360
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That's why we have to guard Prof. Purwa's office.

361
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Who knows, the stone is hidden there.

362
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Prof. Purwa's office

363
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We have to hurry.

364
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Prof. Purwa's office

365
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't make noise.

366
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We'll be caught.

367
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Don't make noise.

368
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Can you be quiet?

369
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yes.

370
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Don't make noise.

371
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let's look for him.

372
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Prof. Purwa's office

373
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Let's walk slowly to the door.

374
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Then, we'll run away.

375
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm scared.

376
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Stop!

377
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Stop!

378
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Stop!

379
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Stop!

380
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Stop!

381
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Stop!

382
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Prof. Purwa's office

383
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Prof. Purwa's office

384
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Prof. Purwa's office

385
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Prof. Purwa's office

386
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Where's the stone?

387
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Prof. Purwa's office

388
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Prof. Langkara?

389
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Thank you for saving us.

390
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Kids, come to my house.

391
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I want to talk to you.

392
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes.

393
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I know Prof. Purwa is the culprit.

394
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
He took the stone.

395
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's why we have to guard his office.

396
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Why?

397
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Because there's a hole in the stone.

398
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We have to hide it.

399
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Kids, what you've done is dangerous.

400
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll try again.

401
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Remember.

402
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Next time, you have to be careful.

403
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
If you want to do research,

404
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
you have to plan it carefully.

405
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And don't make a mistake.

406
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay?

407
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yes, Prof.

408
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You can go now.

409
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Let's go.

410
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Prof. Purwa's office

411
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
What's going on?

412
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Don't pretend.

413
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You did it, didn't you?

414
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Answer me.

415
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What do you mean, Purwa?

416
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Fine.

417
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'll make you understand what I mean.

418
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
What's this?

419
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's nothing, Professor.

420
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I just want to make sure that Prof. Langkara...

421
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The enemy is right in front of us.

422
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We should unite.

423
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Not split up.

424
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You're right, Professor.

425
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The enemy is right in front of us.

426
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'll prove that I'm right.

427
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Just wait and see.

428
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Tomorrow is a holy month.

429
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And we haven't found the stone yet.

430
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We have to keep an eye on Professor Purwa.

431
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Tomorrow, he'll go to school to give the stone...

432
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
...to the Dark Lord.

433
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So, we have to follow him.

434
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Not us.

435
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But me.

436
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But it's impossible, Alva.

437
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You can't do it alone.

438
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's dangerous.

439
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Hold on.

440
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
If you and Rey go with me...

441
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
...the teachers will be suspicious.

442
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm the only one who can sneak out...

443
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
...without being suspicious.

444
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Because everyone knows...

445
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
...that I've been expelled from school.

446
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Alva, wait.

447
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
We're friends.

448
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
No matter what happens, we have to be together.

449
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Hold on, Rey.

450
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Please, listen to me.

451
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You've helped me a lot.

452
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And now, I have to solve this myself.

453
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
This is all my fault.

454
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
This is all my fault.

455
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I took the stone.

456
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And now, I have to get it back.

457
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Alva.

458
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Enough, Rey.

459
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Professor Agni.

460
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Lead all the children to gather at the playground.

461
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Tonight, we have to pray for the safety of the school.

462
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Hurry up.

463
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Don't let the Stone of Eternity...

464
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
...be given to the Dark Lord.

465
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
To be continued...

466
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
To be continued...

467
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
To be continued...

468
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
To be continued...

469
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
To be continued...

470
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
To be continued...

471
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
To be continued...

472
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Why are there two professors?

473
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
This way.

474
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Let's go.

475
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
GAUNTER

476
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
GAUNTER

477
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
One of them must be using a transformation spell.

478
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You can't reach the water.

479
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
If you don't reach the water,

480
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
you'll become a monster.

481
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Water.

482
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Water.

483
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I have to find water.

484
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Where's the water?

485
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
There it is.

486
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's here.

487
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Get it.

488
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
GAUNTER

489
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
GAUNTER

490
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
GAUNTER

491
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Alva.

492
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Don't push Alva.

493
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
She's in danger.

494
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
What are you talking about?

495
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You're the bad guy.

496
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm here to pray for Alva.

497
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Alva.

498
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What do you think?

499
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Who do you trust the most?

500
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You have three minutes...

501
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
to clean this page.

502
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm working with Professor Ankara.

503
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Good, Alva.

504
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Help me attack him.

505
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Let's attack him together.

506
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
GAUNTER

507
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
GAUNTER

508
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
GAUNTER

509
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
GAUNTER

510
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
GAUNTER

511
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You're a coward.

512
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You don't deserve to be in this school.

513
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
GAUNTER

514
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Alva, help me!

515
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Alva, stay there!

516
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
GAUNTER

517
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
GAUNTER

518
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
GAUNTER

519
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

520
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But I won't let anyone disturb my mission.

521
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
To take the Stone of Eternity.

522
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Why are you surprised, Alva?

523
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes.

524
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm the culprit.

525
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Professor!

526
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I'm the culprit.

527
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
GAUNTER

528
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I took the Stone of Eternity...

529
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to give it to the 8th Prince.

530
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So...

531
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I hypnotized Professor Agni...

532
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
by using Professor Turung's body...

533
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
so I could make Alva take the Stone of Eternity.

534
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Alva...

535
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Then I protected you and your friends...

536
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
so you could trust me...

537
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and suspect Professor Purwa.

538
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And I conspired with Professor Agni...

539
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
to take the Stone of Eternity easily.

540
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
GAUNTER

541
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And lastly...

542
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I used your life again, Purwa...

543
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
to defeat you.

544
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
GAUNTER

545
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
GAUNTER

546
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I swear...

547
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the 8th Prince will rise again.

548
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
His power will recover...

549
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and you will all be destroyed.

550
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The destruction of this school...

551
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
will begin with you.

552
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But...

553
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
the first one I will destroy is you.

554
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
GAUNTER

555
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
GAUNTER

556
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
GAUNTER

557
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Alva...

558
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
are you sure you want to fight me?

559
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The power you have...

560
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
is nothing compared to the power I have.

561
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Don't be mean.

562
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I won't let you hurt anyone.

563
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
GAUNTER

564
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I give up!

565
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
In that case...

566
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I will destroy you both.

567
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
GAUNTER

568
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
GAUNTER

569
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
GAUNTER

570
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
GAUNTER

571
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
GAUNTER

572
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
GAUNTER

573
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Professor Aldebaran?

574
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm here to help you.

575
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
GAUNTER

576
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
GAUNTER

577
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Forgive me, Professor Purwa.

578
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I have wrongly accused you.

579
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Your actions are very reckless, Alva.

580
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You could have been killed.

581

Please listen to this important news.

588
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
As you know,

589
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
the Stone of Eternity has been stolen.

590
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
But now,

591
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I'm happy to inform you that...

592
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000

594
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Now,

595
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I will call a child...

596
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
who has helped us find the thief.

597
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000

602
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000

603

And from now on,

614
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the school has decided...

615
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
that Alva...

616
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
will not be allowed to leave the school.

617
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And even...

618
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
the school will give Alva a medal...

619
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
