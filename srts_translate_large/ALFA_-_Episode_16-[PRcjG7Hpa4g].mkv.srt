1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh my God!

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This wound is very bad.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Very, very bad.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And it must be treated immediately with energy transfer.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Kramat Penamat Sword.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Huh? Kramat Penamat Sword?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Defat Ambarga!

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Destroy them all.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't let them enter the castle.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me go!

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to remember Alva.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Vega, Ray, Soleh.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Have you got the sword?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not yet, bro.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now, I'm the one who's wrong.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
To become the sword.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alva?

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They will definitely meet.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If the Dark Lord...

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
will capture and destroy Alva,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
then I...

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
will be the one who will be destroyed first.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Head of the school, head of the head!

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Aldubaran!

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But don't worry about me.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will infuse Aldubaran.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will help you.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Just...

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
what I will infuse is not the Dark Lord in Aldubaran,

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but poison.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Huh?

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Poison, poison!

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mr. Nelly!

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I have to find help.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Alva?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Alva, where are you?

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Isn't that the Dark Lord?

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He often comes to my house.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Alva,

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
do you know who that kid is?

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who?

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That kid is you.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The Dark Lord?

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
My parents?

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If they killed my father,

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
if I'm not taken care of,

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
then...

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
where are they now?

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Of course they don't take care of you.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because both of them...

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
are dead.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Dead?

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why are you so late?

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ketomi, Ketomi.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Please.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Professor Ankara is attacking Professor Aldebaran.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mr. Vega, Mr. Reza, and Mr. Tole are fighting him.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I don't know if they are strong enough or not.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have to do something.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Jack, wait for the kids.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We have to save Professor Aldebaran.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's go, Boss.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you, Ketomi.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Guys!

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We have to save Professor Aldebaran.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's being attacked by Professor Ankara.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Boss.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Have you got it?

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Here.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I got it all.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's look for the others.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What's that?

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's a monster.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's scary.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Ankara.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ankara.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ankara.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ankara.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Ankara.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Kids.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hold on.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Say it.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Feel it.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Dad.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Dad.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Dad.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you doing here?

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We want to help you.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Guys, get ready.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you think you can beat me?

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're underestimating me.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Even though you have 1,000,

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you still can't beat me.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Professor Ankara.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't play with us.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We're special.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How do you know...

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
...why they're dead?

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Here.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Take this.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't let them get away.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Get them.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
To be continued...

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
To be continued...

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
To be continued...

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
To be continued...

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
To be continued...

124
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Grandpa!

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
To be continued...

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
To be continued...

127
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A drop of water from a chosen child...

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
...can restore my power.

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mr. Bonda!

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let me go.

131
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me go.

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
His teeth can kill,

133
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
but you can kill him...

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
...through his teeth.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
His strength is his weakness.

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
His strength is his weakness.

137
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What?

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What did I teach you?

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You killed my monster.

140
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now, listen to me.

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Boko!

142
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Children,

143
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you're all great.

144
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Going to Egypt...

145
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
...to buy turtles.

146
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The children of the magic school...

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
...are really great.

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
To be continued...

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I left a mark on your blood.

150
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's why God's power is perfect.

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Because your blood...

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
...can restore my power.

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No.

154
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't give up.

155
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't give up.

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My blood works like yours.

157
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Boko.

158
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I fight to the death...

159
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
...so that...

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
...you can't...

161
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
...take my blood anymore.

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Who do you think you are?

163
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you know who you're dealing with?

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm the Dark Lord.

165
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Your power...

166
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
...can't beat mine.

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I don't need your blood.

168
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will take your blood...

169
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
...by force.

170
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Take his blood.

171
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Watch out!

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Watch out!

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Watch out!

174
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Watch out!

175
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Brother!

176
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Brother!

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
To be continued...

178
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wake up!

179
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's all because of you, Alva.

180
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please go home, Alva.

181
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Your mission is done.

182
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I won't let the Dark Lord...

183
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
...wake up again!

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
To be continued...

185
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You've made me so angry, Alva!

186
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Alva.

187
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Feel this.

188
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Alva.

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Feel this.

190
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Alva.

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you know what this means?

192
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's a torture spell.

193
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
After this,

194
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
you'll be in great pain.

195
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And you'll hate your parents.

196
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Father.

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Mother.

198
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why did I have to meet you?

199
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why did I have to meet you?

200
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Alva.

201
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Alva.

202
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Father.

203
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Mother.

204
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Now,

205
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I know who you are.

206
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Father.

207
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Mother.

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I've been fighting.

209
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But I lost.

210
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think...

211
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll meet you both.

212
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
No, Alva.

213
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You can't give up.

214
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Riana.

215
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
We'll meet again.

216
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You must defeat the Dark Lord.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're our only hope.

218
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What do I do?

219
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He's so strong.

220
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He has the power of a Star Maiden.

221
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Only with the determination and love in you...

222
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
can you overcome all of Alva's evil.

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You must believe in yourself.

224
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You can do it.

225
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Alright.

226
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I won't give up.

227
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Be patient, Alva.

228
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We'll meet again.

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I want to learn.

230
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If the Dark Lord gets my blood,

231
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
he'll get stronger.

232
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He'll hurt more people.

233
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I must survive.

234
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
For Sega.

235
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
For Ray.

236
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For Peta.

237
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And for Tentara.

238
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Pegasus!

239
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Bird, help me.

240
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
To be continued...

241
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
To be continued...

242
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So, he joined us.

243
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So, our effort is in vain.

244
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Hey.

245
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Don't say it's in vain.

246
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's a white chicken.

247
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's climbing the tree.

248
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't be sad.

249
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Because you've defeated Ankara.

250
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's right.

251
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Ankara has escaped.

252
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You've saved Professor Aldebaran.

253
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Now,

254
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
it's better for you to find and save Alva.

255
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sega.

256
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Ray.

257
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Tole.

258
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Save Alva.

259
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Go.

260
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Save Alva.

261
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You can also bring the Dark Lord.

262
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes, Peta.

263
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh my God.

264
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This is so big.

265
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to be a chicken.

266
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm going to be the strongest.

267
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm not afraid.

268
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh my God.

269
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I've just been beaten.

270
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm a chicken.

271
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm a chicken.

272
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Who are you?

273
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let go of me.

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Let go of me.

277
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What happened to me?

278
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Why am I here all of a sudden?

279
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I thought I was dreaming.

280
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm confused.

281
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Thank you, Mrs. Runda.

282
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You're welcome.

283
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Thank you.

284
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Thank you.

285
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Thank you.

286
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you.

287
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Thank you.

288
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Thank you.

289
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Thank you.

290
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you.

291
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Thank you.

292
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Thank you.

293
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Thank you, Mrs. Runda.

294
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Thank you.

295
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I have to find the Sword of Purnama.

296
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And go back to school.

297
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Why are you here, Alva?

298
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Are you looking for the Sword of Purnama?

299
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yes.

300
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The Sword of Purnama is here.

301
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That's my plan to trap you.

302
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But...

303
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Doctor Pertiwi said that if...

304
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Doctor Pertiwi?

305
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
He has been affected by hypnotism.

306
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
He will talk according to what I want him to talk.

307
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Baseless.

308
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Evil.

309
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Enough, Alva.

310
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's better...

311
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
if you join me...

312
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
than to die in vain.

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You can be my bodyguard.

314
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And we will rule this world.

315
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
No.

316
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't want to.

317
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't want to work with you.

318
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You're a villain.

319
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Murderer.

320
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You're not good enough, Alva.

321
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
How dare you look at the dark side.

322
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll focus.

323
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Angkara...

324
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
failed to get the Sword of Purnama.

325
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But not with your dark side.

326
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Help!

327
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It hurts!

328
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I, Alva...

329
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
will take you.

330
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You want to be my bodyguard?

331
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No.

332
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I won't give up.

333
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It hurts!

334
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Help!

335
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Help!

336
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Help!

337
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Help!

338
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Help!

339
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Help!

340
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think I hear Alva's voice.

341
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Sky...

342
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
please show Alva to me.

343
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Alva?

344
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Enough, Alva.

345
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's useless to fight.

346
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You're just sick.

347
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Bite her!

348
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Let her go!

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Let her go!

350
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Putri Bini.

351
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
What are you doing here?

352
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You want to give me your heart?

353
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you?

354
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Open your eyes, Alva.

355
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm talking through your skull.

356
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Because you're the only one who can hear it.

357
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Come on, open your eyes.

358
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Pangeran.

359
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Do you know what a star's duty is?

360
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
A star's duty...

361
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
is to increase my power.

362
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Wrong.

363
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
A star's duty is...

364
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
to shine!

365
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
My eyes!

366
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Alva, let's get out of here.

367
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Run!

368
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Alva!

369
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Alva!

370
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The darkness only wants my sweat, tears, and blood.

371
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
We can do it.

372
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We can do it.

373
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's Alva.

374
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Alva!

375
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Alva!

376
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Alva, let's go!

377
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alva, let's go!

378
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Hi, everyone.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Let's go up.

380
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Let's go up!

381
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's not enough!

382
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Just a little more and I'll be able to use my power!

383
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Shaleda!

384
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Thank you!

385
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Just take it as my reward...

386
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
because you've brought me back to the sky.

387
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yes, you're welcome!

388
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's go.

389
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Come on, calm down.

390
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Goodbye, Alva.

391
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Goodbye, Vega and Ray.

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Who's that?

393
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I know Vega.

394
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Alva, Ray.

395
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Who's Ray?

396
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Who's Ray?

397
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
She's pretty.

398
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Let's go back to the sky.

399
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We can do it!

400
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We can do it!

401
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We can do it!

402
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We can do it!

403
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We can do it!

404
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
We can do it!

405
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
We can do it!

406
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The dust has been separated by the lightning.

407
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Thank goodness.

408
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Now Alva is safe.

409
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
How are the kids?

410
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Did you get the sword?

411
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
There's no sword.

412
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's just a trick.

413
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's a trap.

414
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The Dark Lord just wants my sweat, tears, and blood.

415
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Pertiwi can't be lying.

416
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Dr. Pertiwi is not lying.

417
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He was just noticed by Professor Angkara.

418
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's true, guys.

419
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's true.

420
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's true.

421
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I was looking for Mushroom.

422
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I met Professor Angkara.

423
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm hypnotized.

424
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's scary.

425
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Now, Pertiwi.

426
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
How do we save Professor Adebaran?

427
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This kind of energy transmission is the best.

428
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And now, Professor Adebaran can rest in the clinic.

429
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And in 1 x 24 hours,

430
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Professor Adebaran will be back.

431
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Isn't it amazing?

432
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Thank God.

433
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Wait.

434
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
For the sake of Professor Adebaran's safety,

435
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I will use this door.

436
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So only the teacher can enter.

437
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That's a good idea, Professor Purwa.

438
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Good.

439
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Lock the door.

440
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What kind of adventure is this?

441
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
In the middle of the road, I met a centaur.

442
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It has a human head.

443
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But it has a horse body.

444
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So, can you defeat it?

445
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Of course.

446
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I, Rey Vega, can defeat it.

447
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Obviously, I'm the strongest.

448
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But, there's more.

449
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The centaur is a white tiger.

450
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
The tiger is huge.

451
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm about to be beaten up.

452
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Why are you quiet?

453
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Speak up.

454
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The centaur is a white tiger.

455
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Sir, you're amazing.

456
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You can defeat the centaur by yourself.

457
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
How can you defeat the centaur by yourself?

458
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Tell me.

459
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Wake up, Alfa.

460
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Alfa, do you know who that is?

461
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Who?

462
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's you.

463
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Why are you crying?

464
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Alfa, what's wrong?

465
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Come on.

466
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Tell us.

467
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What's wrong?

468
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
In the dark, he's evil.

469
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
He killed my parents.

470
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
First, my father was attacked.

471
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Then, he was burned.

472
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Then, my mother was attacked, too.

473
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Because of him, I became an orphan.

474
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Because of him, I don't even know who my parents are.

475
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I don't know.

476
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Why are there evil people in this world?

477
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Alfa.

478
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Not everything in this world...

479
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
...can be understood.

480
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But one thing is clear.

481
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
No matter how strong the evil is...

482
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
...one day...

483
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
...it will be destroyed by the good.

484
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Because in the end...

485
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
...the good will win.

486
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
To be continued...

487
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
To be continued...

488
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Wake up, Farga!

489
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Wake up!

490
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Wake up!

491
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Sir, do you want to use Farga again?

492
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I think it's useless, sir.

493
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Because Alfa knows how to defeat Farga.

494
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I will make Farga again.

495
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Farga!

496
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Like this!

497
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Listen to me. You will not lose.

498
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You only have one chance.

499
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
If Cici is separated from you, now...

500
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
...you destroy this school.

501
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You bring Aldebaran here.

502
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Now!

503
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
If we defeat Aldebaran...

504
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
...then the child will be born with us.

505
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
No!

506
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
No!

507
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
No!

508
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Today we will learn a new mantra.

509
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
A mantra that you can use to defend yourself.

510
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The mantra is...

511
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
...Divinjo.

512
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This mantra...

513
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
...uses the power that comes from within you.

514
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Imagine...

515
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
...the person you love...

516
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
...is sick.

517
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You want to protect him.

518
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You want to do something.

519
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
The greater your power...

520
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
...the greater your ability to protect the person you love...

521
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
...the greater the power of this mantra.

522
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Do you understand?

523
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yes, sir!

524
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Now, pay attention.

525
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Divinjo!

526
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Now, we will see...

527
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
...the mantra.

528
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Now...

529
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
...your turn.

530
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Divinjo!

531
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Next.

532
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Toleng.

533
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Divinjo!

534
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Toleng.

535
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Silence.

536
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Tommy.

537
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Divinjo!

538
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Toleng.

539
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What is that?

540
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's crazy!

541
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's pointing at me!

542
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Alva.

543
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Your turn.

544
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Create your feeling.

545
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Imagine the person you love.

546
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Then, memorize the mantra.

547
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Divinjo!

548
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Toleng.

549
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Divinjo!

550
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Alva!

551
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Very good, Alva.

552
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
What do you imagine...

553
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
...so that you can release that great power?

554
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
My parents, sir.

555
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Alva.

556
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Alva.

557
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Alva.

558
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Alva.

559
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Alva.

560
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Alva, where are you going?

561
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Where are you going?

562
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I want to fight Barga, sir.

563
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
No, you stay here.

564
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But, sir.

565
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
No.

566
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I won't let the kids get hurt.

567
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You stay here.

568
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Let the teachers do their job.

569
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Do you understand?

570
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Sir.

571
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What else?

572
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The weakness is in the belt.

573
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
If the professor takes off the belt...

574
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
...he will be robbed.

575
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Alva.

576
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Everyone.

577
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Attack Barga.

578
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I will try to break the belt.

579
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Because Barga's weakness is in the belt.

580
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Let's go.

581
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Sir.

582
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Alva.

583
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Alva.

584
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
He's gone.

585
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
He's back.

586
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
He's here again.

587
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
What should I do?

588
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm scared.

589
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Let's go.

590
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Alva.

591
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Alva.

592
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Alva.

593
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Alva.

594
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Alva.

595
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Alva.

596
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Alva.

597
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Alva.

598
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
What should we do, sir?

599
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I think I can make him stronger.

600
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Let's go there.

601
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Let's go.

602
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Let's go.

603
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Let's go.

604
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm sorry.

605
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Barga.

606
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Alva.

607
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I feel weird.

608
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I feel dizzy.

609
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I want to faint.

610
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Don't do that.

611
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Don't do that.

612
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
He's so strong.

613
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You attacked him?

614
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Let me help you.

615
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Defend yourself.

616
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yes.

617
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You're so cool, Alva.

618
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You're welcome.

619
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Try me.

620
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You're dead.

621
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You can't defeat Barga, Alva.

622
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Barga is stronger now.

623
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Barga won't be defeated.

624
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Good, Barga.

625
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Keep going.

626
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Don't give up.

627
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Keep going.

628
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Don't give up.

629
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Keep going.

630
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Don't give up.

631
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Keep going.

632
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Keep going.

633
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Keep going.

634
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Don't give up.

635
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Keep going.

636
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Don't give up.

637
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Okay.

638
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Now.

639
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
On the count of three.

640
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We'll fight him.

641
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
One.

642
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Two.

643
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Three.

644
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Attack.

645
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It's okay.

646
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's okay.

647
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Wake up.

648
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
We should go.

649
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We'll lure him out of the school.

650
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
If we stay here, the children will be hurt.

651
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The school will be destroyed.

652
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Let's attack him.

653
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
One, two, three.

654
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Attack.

655
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
One, two, three.

656
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Attack.

657
00:52:43,000 --> 00:53:11,000
To be continued.

658
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:39,000
To be continued.

659
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Pika.

660
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Wake up.

661
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Pika.

662
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Help me.

663
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That's bad.

664
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That's Karaklinik.

665
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
He's going to attack the teacher.

666
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Ouch.

667
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
What happened?

668
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Ouch.

669
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
OMG.

670
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The children must be practicing.

671
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Be careful.

672
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'll stab you.

673
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Wait.

674
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Pegasus.

675
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Pegasus.

676
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Help me.

677
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Wake up.

678
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Wake up.

679
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Wake up.

680
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Wake up.

681
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Wake up.

682
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Wake up.

683
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Wake up.

684
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Wake up.

685
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Wake up.

686
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Wake up.

687
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Pegasus.

688
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Pegasus.

689
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm safe.

690
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Pika.

691
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Where's Alva?

692
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Alva.

693
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Alva.

694
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Alva, where are you?

695
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Alva.

696
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Alva is in the other room.

697
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's heavier.

698
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Don't say it now.

699
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Pika.

700
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Don't say it now.

701
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Let's look for her.

702
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Alva.

703
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Alva.

704
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Alva.

705
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Damn it.

706
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
How dare they kidnap a teenager in the middle of the night.

707
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
They're disgusting.

708
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
They're scary.

709
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Stop it.

710
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
There's no point in fighting like this.

711
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It won't change the future.

712
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Then, what should we do now?

713
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
There's a letter.

714
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
From who?

715
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
From Angkara.

716
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Read it.

717
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I've kidnapped your beloved head of the school.

719
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But don't worry.

720
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
There's a way to save Professor Aldebaran.

721
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That is...

722
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
...to give up Alva.

723
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Alva?

724
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Tonight...

725
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
...before the sun sets...

726
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
...the teachers...

727
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
...have to come and give me Alva.

728
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I won't give Alva to them.

729
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Then, what should we do now, Megantara?

730
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
We're in a very difficult position.

731
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
We have to save Alva...

732
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
...or...

733
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
...Professor Aldebaran.

734
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
We can't give Alva to them.

735
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So, it's better...

736
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
...if one of us...

737
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
...becomes Alva.

738
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Who?

739
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Me.

740
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You, Megantara?

741
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I will find a way...

742
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
...to save Professor Aldebaran.

743
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But right now...

744
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
...the power of the Dark Palace has increased.

745
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It won't be easy for you to defeat him.

746
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But, Professor Ragni...

747
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
...I agree with Megantara.

748
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
They won't be suspicious...

749
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
...if Megantara is missing...

750
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
...from the teachers.

751
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And it's useless for us to debate, but we won't do anything.

752
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Everyone, wait here.

753
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I will prepare a mantra to change the ending.

754
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Now, stand on the chair.

755
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Change.

756
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Alva

757
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Alva

758
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Alva

759
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I ate five of them.

760
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I'm so full.

761
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm Alva the Handsome.

762
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Megantara.

763
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Wait in front of the teacher.

764
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Now, it's time to face them.

765
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Let's go.

766
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I can't go out.

767
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I'm scared.

768
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Alva.

769
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Let's go.

770
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Alva.

771
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Wait.

772
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Alva.

773
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Take off your coat.

774
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Who are you looking for?

775
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
The Handsome.

776
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Handsome.

777
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I will kill you all.

778
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I want to tell you...

779
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
...that Professor Aldebaran was kidnapped by the monster.

780
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Kidnapped?

781
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So, we have to stop the professor.

782
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And we have to defeat the monster.

783
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But, how?

784
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The professor is stronger than the monster.

785
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
This is bad.

786
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
This is really bad.

787
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Why?

788
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Alva was kidnapped by the monster.

789
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
He's hanging on the wall.

790
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Oh, no.

791
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Show your spirit.

792
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Get ready, my friend.

793
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Run, jump, jump.

794
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
We are...

795
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
...brave.

796
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Don't give up.

797
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Chase your dream.

798
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Go, go, go.

799
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Achieve all your dreams.

800
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Go, go, go.

801
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Never stop.

802
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Go, go, go.

803
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Fight with all your might.

804
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Go, go, go.

805
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Make yourself proud.

806
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Go, go, go.

807
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Let's dream.

808
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Go, go, go.

809
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
We are sure.
