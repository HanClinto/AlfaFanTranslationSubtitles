1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go Go Go, make yourself proud

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go Go Go, let's dream

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Go Go Go, we can do it

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The monster likes chocolate

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Weird, how can a monster like that like chocolate?

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have to destroy all the chocolate in the village

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If necessary, destroy all the chocolate trees there

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Go Go Go, let's go

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The monster is great

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The monster is not dead, it just escaped

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the monster can come back?

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It can come back if it smells chocolate

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The chocolate is in my hand

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And you tell Alva

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If Alva still wants this child to live

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then she has to give up

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The sound of a flute played by the head of darkness

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Makes Altagoga calm

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Be a servant

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You teach the sound of the flute

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, I'll teach

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Seriously?

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Even if you don't like it, even if you force it

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Eat it, Momo

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Eat it, Momo

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Professor

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What's up?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong, Vega?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alva went back to the village

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's wrong with Alva?

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Because...

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The police kidnapped Professor Rangkara

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And Professor Rangkara said

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alva has to go there

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There's no one to accompany her, she has to be alone

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If not, the police will be in trouble

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm in a hurry

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll go after Alva

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't let Rangkara hurt Alva

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll go too, Professor

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I have to go save Alva

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If Alva's hair reaches Rangkara

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll cut off Rangkara's body

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll go too, Professor

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can go

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But there's a condition

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's the condition?

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Miffy is Vega's daughter

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why did Professor Rangkara become a witch?

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What does that mean?

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going to be witches

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We're going to be witches

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
With a kid like you

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It'll be easier for me to hold your hand

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm Megantara Rangkara

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wow, Professor's clothes smell so good

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Eat this, Vega

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wow, a witch

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That witch won't be gone for a week

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you, Professor

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a rat

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It bit me

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A rat!

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A rat!

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It bit me!

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Chicken satay

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
With fermented rice

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Relax, man

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's still a long way

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's still a long way?

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can't breathe here

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm going to die

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A rat!

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
A rat!

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When's the last time you took a shower?

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
For me, cleanliness is number one

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The last time I took a shower

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Was three weeks ago

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Huh? Three weeks ago?

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm bleeding!

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It stinks!

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Excuse me

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Professor, thank God you came

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Professor, please help me

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The rat was kidnapped

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Please, Professor

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, I know

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's why we came here

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Thank you, Professor

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sure you can find the rat

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Come on, Professor

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll show you my way

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A rat!

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Ouch!

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's not how you do it, Alva!

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You taught me!

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sorry, I'm still learning

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, I'll try again

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's enough!

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're always wrong!

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You should just continue

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're going to fail!

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't be like that, Popo!

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll try again

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Popo, where are you going?

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right!

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sure you're dancing with the rat

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hooray! I can do it!

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah!

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hooray! I can do it!

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hooray!

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can do it!

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I can do it!

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can do it!

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can do it!

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I can do it!

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hooray!

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thank you!

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Thank you for teaching me!

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Thank you!

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Huh?

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Popo got hugged?

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Usually, everyone treats Popo rough

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Popo...

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Popo, why are you crying?

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Popo, give me a hug!

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, you can do it!

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go to the cave!

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, let's go!

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's go there!

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's go there!

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Galaxy, are we still there?

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We're still going straight ahead, Sir

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Frita!

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh no, I'm leading Frita!

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Poor her, she's all alone there!

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Frita, it's me!

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Can you hear me?

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why are you doing this to me, Sir?

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm so scared, Sir

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's so dark here, Sir!

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm so scared, Sir!

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What's going on?

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm in the cave, I'm being kidnapped, Sir!

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Sir!

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sir!

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sir!

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sir!

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Shut up!

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now, you can't talk anymore, little girl

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've never been through that path with my father

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's full of rocks and dark, Sir

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Please help me, Sir

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Sir!

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How dare you use that mirror without my permission!

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Frita!

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sir!

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Sir!

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Sir!

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think this is not the right path

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Galaxy, who's the real killer?

165
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Galaxy, who's the real killer?

166
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Alkara, Sir

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How do you know?

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wasn't Frita alone in this room?

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And why did you bring us here?

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Shouldn't you be leading us to the path of rocks?

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Do you know the right path?

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't know, Sir

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Too bad, you're too late to know that

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This is sand, Sir

175
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're wrong, Sir

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This sand emits magic

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's useless here

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry, Professor

179
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't lead you to the path of rocks

180
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Only Alpha can go there

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Galaxy!

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Galaxy, where are you?

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Where is it?

184
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Popo, it's still far away

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's over there

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, let's go there

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Be careful

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Popo!

189
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Wait for me

190
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Popo, thank you for saving me

191
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Popo!

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's go, Sir

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Professor, there's an avalanche!

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm scared!

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Ray, Vega, help me!

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Help me, don't touch me!

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Find a rope or something that can help them

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There's an avalanche, Professor!

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Ray, help me!

200
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hurry!

201
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Keep going!

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Keep pulling!

203
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The rope!

204
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hold the rope!

205
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Dad!

206
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank God, we're safe

207
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Vega, Ray, thank you

208
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You two have saved us

209
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're welcome, Professor

210
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're welcome, Professor

211
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's not a loss if you bring me and Vega

212
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Why, Galaxy? Why did you do that?

213
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's none of your business, Professor

214
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Why, Galaxy? Why?

215
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry, Professor

216
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I was threatened by this avalanche

217
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If only they could help me

218
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't want to lose you, Professor

219
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Help me

220
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Galaxy

221
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Why did you do that?

222
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But you know where the real treasure is, right?

223
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I know, Professor

224
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Come on, I'll show you the way

225
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What's this?

226
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How do I get in?

227
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I know how to open the door

228
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And then?

229
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Shake, shake, shake

230
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Shake, shake, shake

231
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Shake, shake, shake

232
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm scared, I'm scared

233
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
If I'm still there, I'll be killed by Professor Ankara

234
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Because I'm scared

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If you're scared, you don't have to come in

236
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Let me come in

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't, I can't

238
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Even though I don't want to

239
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Even though I'm suffering

240
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I have to come in

241
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay, you can come in

242
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But you have to be careful

243
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sorry

244
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Boss!

245
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What are you doing?

246
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What are you doing?

247
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Boss!

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't do this to me

249
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I told you to come in

250
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm scared

251
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm scared

252
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm scared!

253
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Pita!

254
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Pita!

255
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Pita!

256
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Pita!

257
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Where are you, Pita?

258
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Pita!

259
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Pita!

260
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Where are you, Pita?

261
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Boss!

262
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Thank God you're okay

263
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Let's get out of here

264
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
To be continued...

265
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let's go!

266
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm scared

267
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No one can help you now

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Fight the devil

269
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's go!

270
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Hurry!

271
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Hurry!

272
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Let's go!

273
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Help me!

274
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Help me!

275
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Help me!

276
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Help me!

277
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
To be continued...

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
To be continued...

279
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
To be continued...

280
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Papa, wake up!

281
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Wake up, Papa!

282
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
To be continued...

283
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Papa, wake up!

284
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Papa, wake up!

285
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Papa, wake up!

286
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Pita!

287
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
To be continued...

288
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We're finally together, Sis

289
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes

290
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Thank you, Popo, for helping us

291
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's okay, right?

292
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yes, it's okay

293
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's go

294
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's Karah!

295
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You can't just leave like that

296
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Because we're not done yet

297
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You're a traitor

298
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's your turn

299
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
After her

300
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm here, Sis!

301
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
To be continued...

302
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
To be continued...

303
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And now...

304
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Feel this

305
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Don't!

306
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
To be continued...

307
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Wake up, Sis!

308
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Papa!

309
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Papa!

310
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Papa!

311
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Wake up, Papa!

312
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Professor Jahat!

313
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Papa, wake up!

314
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Wake up!

315
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Wake up, Papa!

316
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Alva, where's your father?

317
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Where's your father?

318
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Papa!

319
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Papa!

320
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Wake up, Papa!

321
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Alva!

322
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Alva seems to have been hit by a bullet

323
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Watch your step!

324
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Watch your step!

325
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Professor, we're not done yet

326
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We still have to close the cave's door with a spell

327
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So Antaboga won't appear again forever

328
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That's right, Professor

329
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Let me try, Professor

330
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
What if we try together?

331
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Who knows, we might be able to do it

332
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's do it

333
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
To be continued...

334
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Wake up, Papa!

335
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Why is the door so strong?

336
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You try, Alva

337
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm sorry, Professor

338
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But Alva doesn't seem to be able to do it

339
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Alva, do you want to try?

340
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Of course

341
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let's do it

342
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Concentrate!

343
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You can do it!

344
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Corvo!

345
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Corvo!

346
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Alva, you're so cool!

347
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You're amazing, Alva

348
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
My guess was right

349
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Alva is...

350
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Alva!

351
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Alva, wake up!

352
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Alva!

353
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Alva!

354
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Dad!

355
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Dad!

356
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Wake up, Dad!

357
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We can do it!

358
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
We can do it!

359
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Vega... Ray...

360
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Dadara...

361
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Welcome, Alva

362
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Vega, where's Polita?

363
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She's fine

364
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But, Mr. Galaxy...

365
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What about Mr. Galaxy?

366
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Mr. Galaxy saved you and Polita

367
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
He was attacked by Professor Angkara

368
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
He was attacked by Professor Angkara

369
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
He was attacked by Professor Angkara

370
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He's being treated by Professor Lebaran

371
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Dad...

372
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Dad...

373
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Dad...

374
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Dad...

375
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Dad, wake up...

376
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Dad...

377
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Be patient, Polita

378
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You have to be sincere

379
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Your dad is in there

380
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I only had my dad when I was little

381
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Now, he's gone

382
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm all alone

383
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Polita...

384
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You're not alone

385
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
We're here for you

386
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I want to go to school with you

387
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Do you want to?

388
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes

389
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Come with me later

390
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You want to, don't you?

391
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes, I do

392
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Thank you

393
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
6 months later

394
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Now, we can all go back to magic school

395
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Polita, we'll always be together

396
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So, don't be sad

397
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Dad...

398
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Wait...

399
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I want to come with you

400
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Popo, you can't

401
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We're going to school

402
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
If I don't come with you, I'll die

403
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Alva...

404
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The only way for me to not come with you...

405
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
...is for you to stop being my teacher

406
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But, what do I do?

407
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The only way is to give your hair to Popo

408
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then, she'll be free

409
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Cut!

410
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
6 months later

411
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This is for Popo?

412
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yes

413
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Are you serious?

414
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Yes

415
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Now, you're free

416
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You're not a servant

417
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Free?

418
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm free!

419
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Thank you, Alva

420
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You're the best teacher ever!

421
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You're welcome, Popo

422
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You helped me a lot

423
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'll go now

424
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay

425
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
6 months later

426
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Good evening, kids

427
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Good evening, Sir

428
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Now, I'd like to introduce a new student

429
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Her name is Pelita

430
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Pelita?

431
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hi, I'm Pelita

432
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
My name is Toli

433
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Pelita, please sit with me

434
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Come here, kids

435
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm Pelita

436
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What do you want to eat?

437
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Kids, please continue eating

438
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Okay, Sir

439
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay, Sir

440
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Alva!

441
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Why are you so big?

442
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's like you haven't eaten for a week

443
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm confused, too

444
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Why do I keep getting bigger?

445
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I feel hungry

446
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm confused

447
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
6 months later

448
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Alva!

449
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
What's wrong with you?

450
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I don't know

451
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm scared

452
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't know

453
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I want to eat a rat

454
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I know it's delicious

455
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Do you want to try?

456
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Alva!

457
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What's wrong with you?

458
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Alva!

459
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
What's wrong with you?

460
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Alva!

461
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Alva!

462
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Popo!

463
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Alva!

464
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Alva, wake up!

465
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Help!

466
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Alva, wake up!

467
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Alva, wake up!

468
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Help!

469
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Alva!

470
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Alva!

471
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
What do you feel now?

472
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I feel dizzy

473
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I feel dizzy

474
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Alva has been poisoned by a snake!

475
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The snake has to give her the antidote

476
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If not within 3 days

477
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Alva will turn into a snake

478
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's terrifying!

479
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Where's the antidote?

480
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The antidote?

481
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It's in a place far, far, far away

482
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's in a mysterious island

483
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
A mysterious island far away from home

484
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The antidote is very rare

485
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's called the liquid of life

486
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The liquid of life is very powerful

487
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It can cure all diseases

488
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
All diseases

489
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And it's said that the liquid of life can revive a dead person

490
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So, very amazing!

491
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Very amazing!

492
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Professor

493
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I will go there to find it

494
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You can't, Megantara

495
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Only children can go there

496
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Okay, I'll go there

497
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Me too

498
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Should we let the children go there?

499
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You're right, Professor

500
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm also worried

501
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
This is a difficult decision for me

502
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I don't think I can let the children go there

503
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Without our protection

504
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But we can't let Alva turn into a snake

505
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Professor

506
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We often pass dangerous obstacles

507
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Because we're always compact

508
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So, we can pass this obstacle

509
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes, Professor

510
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I hope we can pass this obstacle

511
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yes, Professor

512
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay, I agree

513
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Thank you, Professor

514
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
What's wrong?

515
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
There's a lot of sand

516
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You don't have to be like that

517
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We're your friends, aren't we, Ren?

518
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Yes, we're friends

519
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So, no matter how hard it is

520
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Or if we're happy, we're together

521
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That's right, Ren

522
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Best, Ren

523
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Wow

524
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm Pelipir

525
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm Nangka

526
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm bullied in the market

527
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You don't know me

528
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm Megantara

529
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Tentara

530
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Why?

531
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'm too cute when I was a kid

532
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But I'm handsome, right?

533
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Tentara, you should join us

534
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yes

535
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Let's go in

536
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I can do it, right?

537
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yes

538
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Tentara

539
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Tentara

540
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm not that smart

541
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
This island is smarter

542
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Tentara

543
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Tentara

544
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Tentara

545
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
No!

546
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Don't use magic here

547
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It's dangerous

548
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But, Tentara

549
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
If you use magic

550
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The magic will come back to you

551
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Tentara

552
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Tentara

553
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Tentara

554
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Tentara

555
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Tentara

556
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Tentara

557
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Catch it

558
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Tentara

559
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Keep it well

560
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It will be useful for you

561
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
At the right time

562
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Tentara

563
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Alva

564
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Vega

565
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Ray

566
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Both of you

567
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The three of you

568
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Remember

569
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You have to be alert

570
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Tentara Kira

571
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We rarely meet, right?

572
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I don't know

573
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But Tentara said

574
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
This will be useful

575
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Let's keep it

576
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Welcome to the Mystery Island

577
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You will pass the first gate

578
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Which is

579
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The Gate of Dreams

580
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
A place where you can eat all kinds of food

581
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But remember

582
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Once you eat that food

583
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You will not be able to continue your journey to the next place

584
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
If you give up

585
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Like a white flag

586
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Automatically

587
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
You will be at the first gate

588
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That's great

589
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Ray

590
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Don't worry

591
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
The important thing is we have to pass all the challenges

592
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Who will be the first one to set up the blue flag at that place?

593
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
He will be the winner

594
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And if there is a disqualified contestant

595
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
He will be disqualified

596
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I have to get that liquid of life

597
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I have to lose everything

598
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So I can live again

599
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And remember

600
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That liquid of life is very rare

601
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Only one person can get that liquid of life

602
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Do you understand?

603
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Yes

604
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Before we start

605
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You can get ready

606
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The toilet is over there

607
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And the costume room is over there

608
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Let's go

609
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
There is no one who can beat Rayyan

610
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
He is so beautiful

611
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
He will make us scared

612
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Why is someone missing?

613
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I have to make them scared

614
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So they can run away

615
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Why is someone missing?

616
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I have to make them scared

617
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So they can run away

618
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And remember

619
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I have to make them scared

620
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So they can run away

621
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Help!

622
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Help!

623
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
What is this?

624
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I am scared

625
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I want to go home

626
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Me too

627
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Are you ready?

628
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yes

629
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Who are you?

630
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Where are you from?

631
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
We are from the inside

632
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We give up

633
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
We give up

634
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We give up

635
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Why do you give up?

636
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Because there are a lot of ghosts

637
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Fishing for anchovies

638
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Who got help

639
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
This is a mystery island

640
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
There are a lot of ghosts

641
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
What about Vega and Rayyan?

642
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Did they get the water of life?

643
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I miss you, dad

644
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Now I don't have anyone

645
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Why did the force reappear?

646
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's been a long time since it reappeared

647
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
After mom died

648
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Mom

649
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Don't leave us

650
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Mom

651
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Don't leave us

652
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Mom

653
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Don't leave us

654
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Mom

655
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Mom

656
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Who are you with?

657
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Rita

658
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Are you ready?

659
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
RITA'S SADNESS

660
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Rita

661
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The sadness that's too deep and long

662
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Will make your strength appear

663
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
If you're angry

664
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It will endanger you

665
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And others

666
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So you have to be careful

667
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You have to be able to control your emotions

668
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
If you're sad

669
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Don't cry

670
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And you have to be calm

671
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I can't be sad

672
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I have to be strong

673
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Until the force reappears

674
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I can't turn it off

675
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
There's a ghost here

676
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It will make me scared

677
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
There's someone missing

678
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm scared

679
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Give me the flag

680
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Give it to the jury

681
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
That's it

682
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
If I throw the white flag

683
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It means I failed

684
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I can't be scared

685
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Why did she throw the white flag?

686
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'll scare her again

687
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I'm not scared

688
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I'm not scared of you

689
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Come out

690
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm not scared of you

691
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I'm not scared

692
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Come out

693
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Why?

694
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You're scared of me, right?

695
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Look at your face

696
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
You're so scared of me

697
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You don't know who I am, Raya

698
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I'm not scared of you

699
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I've been beaten

700
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I got hit on my head

701
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You don't know anything about me

702
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Really?

703
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Look at your face

704
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You're so scared of me

705
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Look

706
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm not scared of you

707
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm not scared of you

708
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
She's so scary

709
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Whatever

710
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'll make her lose

711
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm the winner

712
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Where are you going?

713
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
What?

714
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Where are you going?

715
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Where are you going?

716
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Raya!

717
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I have to get rid of her

718
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And win her trust

719
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Because that's the only way

720
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I can live again

721
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You're so cool, Alva

722
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
To be continued...

723
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Don't ever stop

724
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Fight with all your heart

725
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Make yourself proud

726
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Let's dream

727
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
We'll make it
