1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The power of the heart

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Proud of yourself

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go, go, go

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's dream

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Go, go, go

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can definitely do it

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We don't have much time

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We have to destroy the crystal ball

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because if the crystal ball is full

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That means the energy of the children has been taken

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then the children can die

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Muthiara

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is all because of the curse of the 8th prince

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Muthiara has leaked where the children are now

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Starting tomorrow, you will have a mid-semester vacation

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And you will do a field trip to Sihir village not far from the school

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I just got the news

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If the children from Sihir school will start their tourism to Sihir village

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I feel

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We can attack Alva there

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This time I don't want to fail again

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It turns out that the curse is true

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The plan has come

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We will all be affected by the curse of the monster

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's right

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What did the people mean?

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is the legendary monster?

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go back, go back

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Be quiet all

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
As students of Sihir school

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You all can't be afraid

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What if we become a stone?

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Calm down children

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We will definitely find out what has happened

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Megantara

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's better if you take the children out of here now

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And don't let a single child fly

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Tavan

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Bafinda

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Children

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go to Sihir village

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We have to be together

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And don't let anyone go

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you understand?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, sir

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We have to tell Professor Libaran about this incident

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, sir

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Good afternoon, Professor Aldebaran

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Something terrible has happened here

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
When Nick wanted to report to the galaxy village

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Suddenly he turned into a stone

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Nick turned into a stone

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Who did that?

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We don't know, sir

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It all happened so suddenly

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But now all the children have been taken to Megantara

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, you all keep an eye on the students

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And keep an eye on them

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I will go there with Mr. Tiwi

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
To treat Nick

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, sir

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Stop

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Stop, stop, stop

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why did you suddenly stop?

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's the problem?

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Does it hurt?

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Megantara

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We can't go inside this village

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What?

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is there anything that can stop us?

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh no

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Luckily I didn't go in there

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If I didn't, I would have been burnt

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What really happened to this village?

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What really happened to this village?

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Lura

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For a child who experienced something like this

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What should we do?

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In this village

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There is a lake that water can cure all kinds of diseases

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who knows

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It can ward off this curse

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay, thank you, Mr. Lura

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will go to the lake right away

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Please keep an eye on the children

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Be careful, Megantara

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Be careful

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There is a lightning

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't worry

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Megantara

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Will come back

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stop, Megantara

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Megantara

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't cross this gate

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Professor Aldebaran

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Concentrate, Megantara

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Look slowly

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Professor

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Who instigated this horrible magic in this gate?

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know either, Megantara

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Obviously

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can't leave this village

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And we can't enter the village

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But Professor Aldebaran

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to look for a lake outside this village

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because the lake water

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can restore Nick as he lost

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There is another way, Megantara

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In this village forest

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There is still a mushroom that can cure the curse

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why are you looking for that mushroom now?

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If in three hours

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The child can't be bought a mushroom

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then he will be a stone forever

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Professor

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In the forest there are millions of mushrooms

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Which mushroom can cure the curse here?

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The mushroom is different from the others

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The head is below

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The position is upside down

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's fast

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, I will look for that mushroom

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
By using the Davatang Mantra

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait, wait, wait

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You can't do that

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't use magic

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The strength of the mushroom will be reduced

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's better to use

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Your hands

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Remember, don't use magic

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And one more thing, Megantara

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You have to stay calm

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't show your weakness in front of the children

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
If they get scared

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They will run to this gate

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And endanger them

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, Professor

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Soldiers

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Where are the soldiers?

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Soldiers

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Where are the soldiers?

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes, that's medicine for farming

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I happened to meet Professor Aldebaran

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And Professor Aldebaran apologizes

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He can't gather with you

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because he has something to do

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What should I do?

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I want to go home

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, Bro

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We also want to go home

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Children

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Professor Aldebaran has a message for you

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So that you can help me

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
To look for the forest mushroom

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mushroom?

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, the forest mushroom

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because according to Professor

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This forest mushroom can cure Nick

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But this mushroom is not just any mushroom

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This mushroom grows the fastest

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The umbrella is below

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The mushroom stalk is above

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Pay attention, this is important

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This mushroom cannot be taken by manual

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Professor Aldebaran also has a message for all of you

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
When in the forest

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You have to focus

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't play

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't look left and right randomly

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And hold something that is not important

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do you understand?

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes, Sir

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now you can get ready

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Want to talk to

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Professor Purwa and Professor Akar

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Megantara

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is there a problem?

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This village gate

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Is given a very strong mantra

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's what makes people here

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Can't get out

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And can't get in

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because of that

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Professor Aldebaran

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Can't get out

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And can't get in

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Professor Aldebaran

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Can't come here

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Professor Aldebaran has a message

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So that we can protect the children

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't let

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There are children who dare to break the gate

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because this will be very dangerous for them

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wait

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Children

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Before we go into the magic forest

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
To look for forest mushrooms

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I will

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Divide you into groups

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
One group

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Five people

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Get the fluid

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Now

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You have been divided into groups

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If one of you

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Have got the mushroom

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You just have to make the sound of the fluid

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Do you understand?

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes, Sir

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And if there is a danger approaching you

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You just have to make the sound of the fluid

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Professor

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why are you alone?

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because he is Megantara, Alva

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He is a very strong and tough person

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But you

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't be alone

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You still need a companion

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's go

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Four Weeks Ago

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This thing is so big

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Ramil!

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What are you doing?

236
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Focus on finding the mushroom that grows upside down.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you understand?

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I understand, Prof.

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't touch anything in this forest.

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay, Prof.

241
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hurry, go back to your friends.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Four Weeks Ago

243
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Srigala

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm Megantar.

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
A passerby.

246
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
May I?

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There's something wrong.

248
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I was hit by a tree on the iron bridge.

249
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Smart boy.

250
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Megantar

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Excuse me.

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Good.

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Four Weeks Ago

254
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Srigala

255
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Wow, it's so cool.

256
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, right.

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Prof. Soaldebaran told me not to touch or see anything.

258
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'd better look for the mushroom.

259
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Wow!

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I almost got hit by a tree.

261
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But it's okay.

262
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm sure I can catch it.

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Four Weeks Ago

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Srigala

265
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's the mushroom!

266
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I got it.

267
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can use my magic.

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What should I do?

269
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll use my magic.

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's impossible.

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can't catch it.

272
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There it is.

273
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Four Weeks Ago

274
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I got it.

275
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How is it, Vega?

276
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Did you get the mushroom?

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes, Prof.

278
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But it's over there.

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I can't get it.

280
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't worry.

281
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Leave it to me.

282
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Four Weeks Ago

283
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Srigala

284
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Thank you, Prof.

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You're so kind.

286
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You'd better keep your voice down.

287
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So, the others will know that we got the mushroom.

288
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes, Prof.

289
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Four Weeks Ago

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The mushroom has been found.

291
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So, we can catch it.

292
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's go there.

293
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's go.

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm so happy.

295
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Help!

296
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Help!

297
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Help!

298
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Four Weeks Ago

299
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Help!

300
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Help!

301
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Help!

302
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Four Weeks Ago

303
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Let's go there.

304
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Help!

305
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Help!

306
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The mushroom has been found.

307
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Four Weeks Ago

308
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No, Alva.

309
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Alva!

310
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Alva!

311
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Alva!

312
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Alva!

313
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Alva!

314
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Alva!

315
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Alva, where are you?

316
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Alva, where are you?

317
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Alva, where are you?

318
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Alva, where are you?

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's useless to look for Alva.

320
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Maybe, Alva has turned into a rock.

321
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, it's been a day.

322
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's go.

323
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Where are you?

324
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Alva!

325
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Alva!

326
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
People like that can't be found.

327
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's look for Alva again.

328
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Alva!

329
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Alva!

330
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Alva!

331
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Alva!

332
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Alva!

333
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Alva, where are you?

334
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Four Weeks Ago

335
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Help!

336
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Help!

337
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Help!

338
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Help!

339
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
My arm!

340
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Help!

341
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Let me go!

342
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Don't make noise!

343
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
God!

344
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Let me go!

345
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I want to go back to the group!

346
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
They will find me!

347
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Help!

348
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Don't call me!

349
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Who are you?

350
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
God Almighty!

351
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You have to go with me...

352
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
...to the eighth heaven.

353
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The eighth heaven?

354
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Help!

355
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Do you want a gun?

356
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't know...

357
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
...if you want to attack me.

358
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Shut up!

359
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You're lying.

360
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's okay.

361
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's better...

362
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
...if I use my power.

363
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Let's go.

364
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Come on!

365
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh my God!

366
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I want a gun!

367
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I want a gun!

368
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Come on!

369
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I want a gun!

370
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I want a gun!

371
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I want a gun!

372
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There are so many of them.

373
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Let's fry them.

374
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We can do it!

375
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Last time...

376
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
...a ghost like you...

377
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Now...

378
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
...do you know...

379
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
...how great I am?

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Now...

381
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
...you...

382
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
...take your magic wand...

383
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
...and...

384
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
...I'll count to ten.

385
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
If you don't take your magic wand...

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
...tomorrow morning...

387
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
...you'll be my breakfast.

388
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The eighth day.

389
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Let's do it again.

390
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
One.

391
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Two.

392
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Three.

393
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Why are you just standing there?

394
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm just kidding.

395
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm serious.

396
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Can't you see?

397
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm serious.

398
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll take your magic wand.

399
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Four.

400
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Five.

401
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Six.

402
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Seven.

403
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'll count to ten.

404
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Eight.

405
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Nine.

406
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Ten.

407
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Eleven.

408
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Twelve.

409
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Thirteen.

410
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Fourteen.

411
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Fifteen.

412
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Sixteen.

413
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Seventeen.

414
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Eighteen.

415
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Nineteen.

416
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Twelve.

417
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Thirteen.

418
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Fourteen.

419
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Fifteen.

420
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Sixteen.

421
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Seventeen.

422
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Eighteen.

423
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What are you doing here?

424
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Why are you attacking that way?

425
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The Eighth Day.

426
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's hard.

427
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There are so many.

428
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll fry them.

429
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Pretty girl.

430
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There are so many.

431
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Tiara.

432
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I know you don't like men.

433
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But now, you have to help me.

434
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Malik is evil.

435
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He wants to take me to the Eighth Day.

436
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Girls.

437
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Angfa is kind.

438
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
She helped me before.

439
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So, we have to help her.

440
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Come on, girls. Let's help her.

441
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You're annoying.

442
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You don't know who we are.

443
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
How dare you to play with me?

444
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Now, feel this.

445
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
How come?

446
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Girls.

447
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Help!

448
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Angfa.

449
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You should go.

450
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's all your fault.

451
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Poor her.

452
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
She can't swim.

453
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
She'll drown.

454
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
What if she drowns?

455
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
She'll die.

456
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Poko.

457
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's okay.

458
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Let's go.

459
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Let's go.

460
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Let's go.

461
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Let's go.

462
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Let's go.

463
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Just let her be.

464
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
She doesn't like men.

465
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That's why she hates men.

466
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Come on, girls.

467
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Help!

468
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Poko.

469
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Help!

470
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Poko.

471
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Poko.

472
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Help!

473
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Help!

474
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Bobo.

475
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Bobo.

476
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Bobo.

477
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Bobo.

478
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Thank God.

479
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Bobo.

480
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You saved Bobo.

481
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Sial.

482
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
What's wrong, Sial?

483
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You saved Bobo.

484
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Now, you want to give him to me?

485
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
No.

486
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Now, I have to go back to the group.

487
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Wait.

488
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Do you think I like this?

489
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I have to do this.

490
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I have to.

491
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Fine.

492
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
If you have to do this, then don't.

493
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I won't ask for it.

494
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Don't say that.

495
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Who saved Bobo's life...

496
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
...will be my employer.

497
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
If not...

498
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
...Bobo will die.

499
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But, Bobo is my promise.

500
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So, do you want to be my employer now?

501
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So?

502
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yes.

503
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'll be your servant.

504
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But, I have to go to the village.

505
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I have to meet many people there.

506
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Just say it.

507
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Bobo saved you.

508
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You're right.

509
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Let's go there.

510
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Don't.

511
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yes.

512
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just say it.

513
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
If you don't go there...

514
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
...you'll be eaten there.

515
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
If you don't go there, what will you wear?

516
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So?

517
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Who is this, Alva?

518
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What are you doing?

519
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
To be continued...

520
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
After this mosquito is killed...

521
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
...they will recover in 48 hours.

522
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I hope...

523
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
...both of them will be fine.

524
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Prof, how is Netola and Kanik?

525
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Don't worry, Vega.

526
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
They will recover in 48 hours.

527
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Mosquitoes are venomous.

528
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So, they will recover.

529
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Dad, help!

530
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Dad, help me!

531
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Dad, help!

532
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Dad, help!

533
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Dad, help me!

534
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Dad, help!

535
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Dad, help me!

536
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Dad, help me!

537
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Dad, help me!

538
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Shut up!

539
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I'll beat you up.

540
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You never listen to me.

541
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Bobo.

542
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't be like that.

543
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Don't be like that.

544
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Poor him.

545
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm looking for him.

546
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Dad, help me!

547
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Dad.

548
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Dad.

549
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Dad, those kids came in from our roof.

550
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Alva.

551
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Alva.

552
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Alva.

553
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Alva, thank God.

554
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's okay, honey.

555
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Don't be afraid.

556
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Alva is your friend, too.

557
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Alva, where have you been?

558
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm worried about you.

559
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I thought you were a rock.

560
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You've been lying to me.

561
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm not lying. I'm just worried.

562
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Stop it.

563
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Alva.

564
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Alva.

565
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Alva.

566
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Stop it.

567
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Alva is safe now.

568
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's it.

569
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It's not easy for Bobo.

570
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I fought with them.

571
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Then?

572
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Who is this, Alva?

573
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
What are you doing?

574
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Do you want to get whacked?

575
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Bobo, don't be rude.

576
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Introduce yourself.

577
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
My name is Bobo.

578
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Where are you going? I'm lost.

579
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What should I do now?

580
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Bobo and Alva...

581
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Because Alva is kind enough to help Bobo.

582
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Bobo Kurcaci who lives in Subatangkara...

583
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
...doesn't have a place to stay.

584
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Can Bobo stay with you?

585
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No.

586
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You can't do that. You have to be polite.

587
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Bobo, you can stay here.

588
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's time to eat.

589
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Let's eat.

590
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You must be hungry.

591
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Let's go.

592
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Bobo Kurcaci

593
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Bobo Kurcaci

594
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Bobo Kurcaci

595
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Bobo Kurcaci

596
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Bobo Kurcaci

597
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Bobo Kurcaci

598
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Please enjoy.

599
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Don't be so rude.

600
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I had to do it.

601
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You don't have to do it.

602
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Alva, why did you bring him here?

603
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
He's scary. You can't trust him.

604
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
He looks scary.

605
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Look at him.

606
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Bobo Kurcaci

607
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Bobo Kurcaci

608
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Bobo Kurcaci

609
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Bobo Kurcaci

610
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Bobo Kurcaci

611
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Bobo Kurcaci

612
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Bobo Kurcaci

613
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Bobo Kurcaci

614
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Bobo Kurcaci

615
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
How could we be trapped here?

616
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Don't be so harsh, Professor Purwa.

617
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
We have to cover this up.

618
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Don't make the kids panic.

619
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Yes.

620
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I feel sorry for the kids.

621
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
We brought them here...

622
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
...to have a field trip.

623
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
To have fun.

624
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But the truth is...

625
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
...we're all trapped here.

626
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I have an idea.

627
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
There's a bomb...

628
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
...under the school.

629
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It's a new disease.

630
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Don't worry, Professors.

631
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Tomorrow...

632
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
...we'll ask them to do something fun.

633
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
A FEW HOURS LATER

634
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Rita.

635
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What's wrong?

636
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Why are you here?

637
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm scared, Feika.

638
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Scared of what?

639
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What happened today...

640
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
...can't be the same...

641
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
...as in the legend.

642
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Legend?

643
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
What legend?

644
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
A FEW HOURS LATER

645
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Dad?

646
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Dad?

647
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Dad?

648
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Dad?

649
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Dad?

650
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Dad?

651
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Dad?

652
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Dad?

653
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Dad?

654
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Why are you crying?

655
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I told you to come here, Alva.

656
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But why are you so stubborn?

657
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
This place is too dangerous for you.

658
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Who are you?

659
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Why do you keep showing up in my dream?

660
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm Gamar.

661
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm Quila.

662
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
We're both...

663
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
...so close to God.

664
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Now you have to remember, Alva.

665
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Don't ever look at those eyes again.

666
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Remember.

667
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Don't ever look at those eyes again.

668
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
What do you mean?

669
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Whose eyes?

670
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Gamar!

671
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Quila!

672
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Gamar!

673
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Why did you wake up?

674
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Were you dreaming?

675
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And?

676
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I couldn't sleep.

677
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Why?

678
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I don't know, Dad.

679
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But I have a feeling.

680
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I think the teachers are hiding something from us.

681
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Hiding something?

682
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Two kids have been killed.

683
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But we can't go home yet.

684
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And...

685
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
...Professor Lebaran.

686
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
He said he was coming.

687
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But he's not here yet.

688
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
If this legend is true...

689
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
...it means the monster is gone.

690
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And later we have to find out...

691
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
...who took the power.

692
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
What are you doing here?

693
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It's a good question.

694
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I have a clue about this.

695
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Come here.

696
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Here.

697
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This is the book.

698
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
100 years ago...

699
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
...the people of Sihir village lived in peace.

700
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Until one day...

701
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
...a disaster came to the village.

702
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Help!

703
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Help!

704
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The disaster was a curse.

705
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The village was in chaos.

706
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And many people turned into stone.

707
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Help!

708
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Help!

709
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's so scary.

710
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The only hope of the village was...

711
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
...a great sorcerer named Bima Sakti.

712
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
BIMA SAKTI

713
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The villagers were still scared.

714
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
They couldn't trust anyone.

715
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Even a good sorcerer like you.

716
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
What's wrong, Bambi?

717
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Help!

718
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Save this village, Bima Sakti.

719
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Look.

720
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
This village is like dead.

721
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
No one dares to leave the house.

722
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Because they're afraid of being cursed into stone.

723
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Why did you curse the snake?

724
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
My family...

725
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
...was destroyed...

726
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
...by the monster.

727
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Finally, Bima Sakti faced the monster.

728
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Bu Furuh!

729
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Bu Furuh!

730
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Bima Sakti defeated the monster...

731
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
...and locked it in the cave.

732
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
No one knew where the cave was.

733
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But...

734
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
...the spell didn't last forever.

735
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So the monster...

736
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
...could be released.

737
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
BIMA SAKTI

738
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Only the fifth generation can open it.

739
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
If this legend is true...

740
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
...it means the monster is released.

741
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
We have to find out...

742
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
...who is Bima Sakti's descendant...

743
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
...who can lock the monster inside.

744
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Who is he?

745
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
BIMA SAKTI

746
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
All the disciples and teachers in the village are in danger.

747
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
What should I do...

748
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
...so I can enter the village...

749
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
...and help them?

750
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Children.

751
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Even though we're on vacation...

752
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
...we still have to learn the spell.

753
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Children.

754
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Now I'm going to teach you...

755
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
...a spell.

756
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
This spell can neutralize...

757
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
...the attack of the enemy...

758
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
...that makes you powerless.

759
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It makes you stiff.

760
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And you can't do anything.

761
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
But if you use this spell...

762
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
...you will be free...

763
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
...and normal again.

764
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes. Great.

765
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I have to be able to do it...

766
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
...so I won't be stiff like Tole.

767
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Teach me.

768
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Okay.

769
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Now get ready.

770
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
We will make you stiff...

771
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
...and powerless.

772
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Kavaku Bada.

773
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Concentrate.

774
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Now I'm going to teach you...

775
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
...a spell...

776
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
...that will make you free...

777
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
...from your powerlessness.

778
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
The spell is...

779
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
...free first.

780
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Come on, children.

781
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Concentrate.

782
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Who can be free first...

783
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
...can take the chocolate on the table.

784
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And if you can't free yourselves...

785
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
...you will be punished.

786
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
To be continued...

787
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
To be continued...

788
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
To be continued...

789
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
To be continued...

790
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
To be continued...

791
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
To be continued...

792
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
To be continued...

793
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Be free!

794
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Be free!

795
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Don't!

796
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Don't bother us!

797
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Don't bother me!

798
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But he didn't mean to.

799
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
He was so scared.

800
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
He mispronounced the spell...

801
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
...and he got you.

802
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Forgive him.

803
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Be free!

804
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Children.

805
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Help me.

806
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
What's wrong?

807
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What's wrong?

808
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Wait a minute.

809
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm surprised.

810
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
How can a snake talk to you?

811
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I'm surprised too.

812
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But I used to talk to a snake.

813
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
When?

814
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
When I lived with my uncle and aunt.

815
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Is it weird that I can talk to a snake?

816
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Wait.

817
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You can talk to a snake when you're sick.

818
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
What else can you say about a snake?

819
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You're lying.

820
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
The snake's teeth can kill.

821
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But you can kill it...

822
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
...through its teeth.

823
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You're talking nonsense.

824
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Maybe I'm a descendant of the snake.

825
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
If it's like this...

826
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
...how can we get out of here?

827
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And we can't go home either.

828
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Because the village gate...

829
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
...is haunted by a very powerful spell.

830
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
We're all trapped here.

831
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Now we know...

832
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
...that the monster likes chocolate.

833
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So we have to warn our friends...

834
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
...so they don't eat chocolate.

835
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I agree.

836
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So the others can't get the monster.

837
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Let's go.

838
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Opo.

839
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Do you want to help me...

840
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
...in my new job?

841
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
To be continued...

842
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
To be continued...
