00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Make yourself proud!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go! Go! Go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
To be continued...

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're not done yet, Megantar.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We still have to close the cave's door with a mantra.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So that Antaboga won't appear again forever.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I only had my father when I was little.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now he's gone.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm all alone.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Megantar.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're not alone, Ko.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You still have us.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Just join us to school.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now you're free.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're not a servant to anyone.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Free?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yay! I'm free!

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I have to get that life fluid.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have to defeat them all.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So I can live again.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And remember.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Life fluid is very rare.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Only one person can get that rare life fluid.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No one can defeat Raya.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She's so pretty.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not afraid of you.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm bored.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She's so lame.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Whatever.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to make her lose.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have to win.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's wrong, Pegah?

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Guys.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Pegah.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You've been in the toilet for so long.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I met a ghost.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A ghost?

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's scary.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not scary anymore.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But it's annoying.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's annoying.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And it sings.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's trying to scare the contestants.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So that they'll fail.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I see.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There were some kids who gave up.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And flew the white flag.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And they were defeated.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So we have to be careful.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And remember.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We can't give up.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ray.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Ray.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Did you hear that?

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We can't eat this.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If we eat it, we'll fail.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No way.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I know.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But I really want to eat it.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It looks delicious.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm hungry.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Ray.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you want to fail?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have to scare them.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So that they'll eat it.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If it's like this, I'll become a normal kid.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll eat it.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll eat it.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll eat it.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll eat it.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll eat it.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll eat it.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll become a normal kid.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's delicious.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hi.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you want it?

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just eat it.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm hungry.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But they said you can't eat it.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who said that?

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Just eat it.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Just a little.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I won't be caught by the judges.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Just eat it.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm hungry.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll eat it.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll eat it.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll eat it.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll eat it.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll eat it.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's delicious.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hi.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm Raya.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm Ray.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The ice cream you're looking at is delicious.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, it's delicious.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Just eat it.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If I eat it, I'll fail.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Who said that?

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I've tried it.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Really?

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just eat it.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You'll regret it.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Just eat it.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You again.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What are you doing?

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Open the door.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wait.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What are you doing here?

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You made me lose.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So what?

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's not your fault.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Listen.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If I win, I'll get a life sentence.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If I win, I'll get a life sentence.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, you're a prostitute too?

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We're trying to win.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We'll win against you.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You'll win against me.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, just give up.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just give up.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I won't give up.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But, it's up to you.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you lose, don't cry.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're doing our homework.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's play.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, we don't want to play.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We're doing our homework.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's play.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't want to lose.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You don't want to play with me?

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll call Vega.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Can I borrow this?

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No.

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's okay.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't waste our time.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's go.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Vega doesn't care about me.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He cares about Alva.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't want to lose.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't want to lose.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't want to lose.

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't want to lose.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Dad, I miss you.

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm lonely.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm lonely, dad.

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A key?

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What should I do?

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm getting more scared.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm scared.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to hit it.

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Just a little.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Just a little.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Just a little.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Just a little.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Alva, wake up.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Alva.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Vega.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What did I do?

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You bit my hand.

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Are you okay?

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes, I'm okay.

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It hurts a little.

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't eat this.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We're here to win the competition.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For Alva.

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We're here to win the competition.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For Alva.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry, Reda and Vega.

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because of me...

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
...they're having a hard time.

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go.

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We're here to win the competition.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Don't.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't touch me.

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What's wrong?

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you okay?

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Come here.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll help you.

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't.

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Come here.

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's go.

213
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's go.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's go.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's go.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Let's go.

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In this park...

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
...there are a lot of candies.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Your task...

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
...is to collect...

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
...100 candies in 30 minutes...

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
...in a bucket.

223
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The one who succeed will go to the next round.

224
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The one who fail...

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
...will be eliminated and sent home.

226
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Get ready.

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Start.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Remember.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The candies you collect...

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
...shouldn't be eaten.

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you eat it...

232
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
...you'll be sent home.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The candies that fall from the bucket...

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
...won't be counted.

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I got it.

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Raya.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Raya.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Why are you so slow?

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll go first.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You should be brave.

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Raya.

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Watch out, Raya.

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
One.

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Two.

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Three.

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Four.

247
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Five.

248
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Four.

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Five, too.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Four.

251
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Five.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Look at this.

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I got two papers.

254
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're so arrogant.

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's go.

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Raya.

257
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oops.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Sorry.

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I didn't mean to.

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Watch out.

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Raya.

262
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You missed.

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Watch out.

264
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're so slow.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Watch out.

266
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's enough.

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's better...

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
...to collect the candies that you dropped.

269
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Raya.

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's enough.

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's go.

272
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Why is it gone?

273
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Raya.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I just remembered.

275
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The candy that fell from the bucket...

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
...won't be counted.

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That means it won't be counted.

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's because of Raya.

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Raya.

280
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Raya.

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Rai.

282
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Calm down.

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There's still time.

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There's still time...

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
...for the replacement.

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What?

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There's no time.

288
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's only five minutes left.

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Where are you going?

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm going with Vega.

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going to throw up.

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is just a practice.

293
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If we lose because of him,

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I won't forgive him.

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Where's your camera?

296
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Where's my camera?

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There it is.

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Let me try it.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There are two of them.

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There are two of them.

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Try again.

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Try again.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes!

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We did it!

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Let's give it to the jury.

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's go.

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You won.

308
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes!

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You won.

310
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes!

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You won.

312
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes!

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You won.

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes!

315
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You won.

316
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes!

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Friends forever.

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Best friends forever.

319
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah!

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I think they're the toughest opponent.

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I have to beat them...

322
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
...and win their trust.

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Because that's the only way...

324
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
...I can come back to life.

325
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You lost.

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You lost.

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You won.

328
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Help!

329
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hello!

330
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Alva!

331
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm coming!

332
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Where's Alva?

333
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Where's Alva?

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
She's with my little friend.

335
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't call me little friend.

336
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm Kurcaci Ganjang.

337
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You don't know?

338
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If you call me Kerdil again...

339
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
...I'll turn you into a monster.

340
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Calm down.

341
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Where's Alva?

342
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I want to see her.

343
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Alva is looking for medicine.

344
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
With them.

345
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Alva is sick.

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They're looking for medicine.

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why didn't they invite me?

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't know.

349
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What's that?

350
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
A new mantra?

351
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't know.

352
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That means I don't know.

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's a fairy tale.

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I should talk to pretty people...

355
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
...instead of talking to ugly people.

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hey, you!

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Move!

358
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Kurcaci Ganteng wants to pass.

359
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm here.

360
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm here.

361
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You're weak.

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hello, Pelita.

363
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you still remember me?

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm Kurcaci Ganteng, Alva's friend.

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes, I still remember.

366
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't you want to take my hand?

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry, I can't.

368
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why not?

369
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You're not polite.

370
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Leave me alone.

371
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I want to be alone.

372
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Because I'm Kurcaci...

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
...you don't want to shake hands with me?

374
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're arrogant.

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm not arrogant.

376
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I still have self-esteem as Kurcaci.

377
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I feel like I'm being trampled by you.

378
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You should shake hands with me.

379
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, you should leave.

380
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Go away!

381
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm not arrogant.

382
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Go away!

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll force you.

384
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Popo!

385
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Someone found out about this.

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If they find out, I'll be kicked out of school.

387
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Pelita!

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
To be continued...

389
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Popo, I want you to stay here.

390
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I want you to stay here.

391
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This is a dead end.

392
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What if...

393
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
...there's another attack?

394
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We have to report this to the professor.

395
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's go.

396
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is weird.

397
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I feel like the weather is changing.

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A few hours ago, it was 30 degrees.

399
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Now it's 17 degrees.

400
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes, you're right.

401
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What if there's another attack?

402
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't feel any negative energy from this.

403
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't think this is an attack.

404
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What is this, Professor?

405
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This is a special power...

406
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
...owned by a student in this school.

407
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Who is he? Who is his son?

408
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know.

409
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But we have to find him.

410
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
If this power is not controlled, it can be dangerous.

411
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Now I'm wearing gloves.

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
If my friends touch me, they'll be in trouble.

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Hey, Pelita!

414
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Pelita, come here.

415
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
No, I don't want to.

416
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Why don't you wear the gloves?

417
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But I don't want to.

418
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
He's so rude.

419
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He's just like his friends, Alva, Vegas, and Ray.

420
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Alva, Vegas, and Ray. They're not cool at all.

421
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Don't call Alva, Ray, and Vega.

422
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They're good friends.

423
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The best friends in the world?

424
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm the best.

425
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Alva!

426
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Help!

427
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Help!

428
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Help!

429
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What's going on here?

430
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
He's a monster!

431
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What are you doing here?

432
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm not a professor. I don't know what's going on.

433
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
He's lying!

434
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
He's lying!

435
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I saw him with my own eyes.

436
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He must be a monster!

437
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Let him out!

438
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm innocent.

439
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't throw me out of school.

440
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I don't have anyone else.

441
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He's a monster!

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Don't work with him!

443
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He must be expelled from school!

444
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Let him out!

445
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Maybe Tommy was right.

446
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I can't be here.

447
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Because I can hurt innocent people.

448
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like Popo.

449
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm sorry, Professor. I didn't mean to.

450
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Rita!

451
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Now you have to walk through that bridge.

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You have to use your powers.

453
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No magic, no flying, and no magic.

454
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't forget, you have to be careful.

455
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because if you fall, you'll be in danger.

456
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Popo can fly.

457
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
He must be number one.

458
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But don't worry.

459
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I can make other kids fall.

460
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But the camera is for focusing.

461
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What's this cover for?

462
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Let's try it.

463
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I have to win. I can't lose.

464
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's Raya's voice.

465
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It can hear people's voices.

466
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
When I pass, I'll tell Vega, Ava, and Ray...

467
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
...to fall and bring smoke.

468
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Just watch. I'll make them lose.

469
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Guys, wait.

470
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Do you know how to use it?

471
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I know.

472
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It can hear people's voices.

473
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I heard Raya was about to attack us.

474
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Are you serious?

475
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We have to be careful. Raya is behind us.

476
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
To be continued...

477
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I can't fall.

478
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If I fall, I'll fail.

479
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
What should I do?

480
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I can't fly.

481
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
If I fly, I'll fail.

482
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Guys, let's just leave him.

483
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's useless to help him.

484
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Poor Vega. What if he really falls?

485
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
He's a ghost.

486
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
He's gone. It's useless to help him.

487
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If he falls, he won't die.

488
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We can't just leave him. We have to help him.

489
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Let's go.

490
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, Vega. We have to help him.

491
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I won't be long.

492
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Ava. Raya.

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Give me your hand.

494
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You're my mom, right?

495
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yes.

496
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We're rivals.

497
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's fair.

498
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Give me your hand.

499
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
To be continued...

500
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Thank you, Ava.

501
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you don't help me, I'll fail.

502
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Goodbye, Raya.

503
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Ava, what's wrong?

504
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Ava, what's wrong?

505
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What's wrong?

506
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Ava.

507
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Ava.

508
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's because of you, Raya.

509
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Ava.

510
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What should we do?

511
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
In five minutes, you have to arrive at the next gate.

512
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The children who are late will be sent back to the gate.

513
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
What should we do?

514
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Oh, my God.

515
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So, this is the effect of the child named Pelita?

516
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yes.

517
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I've heard of a power that can turn everything into ice.

518
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Freezing.

519
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Even a small child can't handle it.

520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And it turns this school into freezing.

521
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Ice.

522
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And it can freeze itself.

523
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This is very dangerous.

524
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You three can go to the next gate.

525
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes.

526
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Thank you, Raya, for helping me.

527
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Now, we've entered the first gate.

528
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And there's one more gate that we have to pass.

529
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I want to tell Pelita that we're on an adventure today.

530
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
We're on an adventure today.

531
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Why is it on?

532
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Maybe Pelita is calling me.

533
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Maybe.

534
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Pelita.

535
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Pelita.

536
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Pelita, are you calling me?

537
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Pelita, answer me.

538
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Pelita.

539
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Pelita, answer me.

540
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I want to go home.

541
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Don't go.

542
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Don't leave me.

543
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I want to go home.

544
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Pegah.

545
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Come on, let's go.

546
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Why are you wasting our time?

547
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
If they see me like this, they'll be afraid to be friends with me.

548
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Let's not give up.

549
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Raya's soul has fallen.

550
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So, we have to hold on.

551
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
To be continued...

552
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
To be continued...

553
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
To be continued...

554
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
All of this is because of one thing.

555
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
My power has become weak.

556
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Sir.

557
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Help me, sir.

558
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Help me, sir.

559
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Where did you come from?

560
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Why can't you come back to your senses?

561
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
All of this is because of Ullah Aldebaran.

562
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
He always stops me.

563
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And all of my plans failed because of him, sir.

564
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
If that's the case, I have to kneel.

565
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But sir, your power hasn't recovered yet.

566
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You won't be able to fight Aldebaran.

567
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But now I have a great weapon that can defeat Aldebaran.

568
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
He will get the chosen one.

569
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's weird.

570
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Why can't he answer?

571
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Maybe he's playing with his friend.

572
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's possible.

573
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay, let's inform him later.

574
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's better if we continue our journey.

575
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Okay.

576
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Let's go.

577
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Welcome back, children.

578
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I wish you all the best.

579
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because you have passed the first gate.

580
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The gate of dreams.

581
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
This second gate is called the gate of patience.

582
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
As the name implies.

583
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
In this gate, you will be tested for your patience.

584
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
In this gate, you can't be angry.

585
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You can't be selfish.

586
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And you can't force your opponent.

587
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Do you understand?

588
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Let's go.

589
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That's right.

590
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
This is the canteen.

591
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Now, you can eat first.

592
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yes.

593
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Finally, we can eat.

594
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yes.

595
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm sure the food is better than the first gate.

596
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's right.

597
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm sure there's grilled chicken.

598
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Where's the food?

599
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Enjoy your meal.

600
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm sure the food is delicious.

601
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Food.

602
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Let's open it.

603
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's open it.

604
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
One.

605
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Two.

606
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Three.

607
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Ta-da.

608
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Look at the food.

609
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
The food is all over the place.

610
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The food looks like this.

611
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's delicious.

612
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I don't like vegetables.

613
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I don't want to eat it.

614
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Me too.

615
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't want to eat vegetables.

616
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I don't want to eat vegetables.

617
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Rai.

618
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Rai.

619
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Rai.

620
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I don't want to eat it.

621
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Rai.

622
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
As I said before.

623
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This place is for trial and error.

624
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You have to finish the vegetables and don't get angry.

625
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
If you get angry or give up.

626
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
You'll go back to the first gate.

627
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And if you finish the food.

628
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You'll be considered a loser and go back to the first gate.

629
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
What should we do?

630
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
We can't give up.

631
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Rai is a loser.

632
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So we have to be patient.

633
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes, we have to be patient.

634
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Even though I don't like tomatoes.

635
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But I have to be patient.

636
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I have to eat this tomato.

637
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
As long as I have a snake in my body.

638
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I want to eat meat.

639
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Especially this tomato.

640
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
We have to be patient, Fah.

641
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You have to handle your emotions.

642
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Because we have to go through all this.

643
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yes, Vega.

644
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
To be continued...

645
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
To be continued...

646
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
To be continued...

647
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Concentrate.

648
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And read the mantra.

649
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So you'll be stable.

650
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Okay, sir.

651
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Let's go.

652
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh, my God.

653
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, my God.

654
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
They must be cold.

655
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And they fainted.

656
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's better if we carry them with a pole.

657
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Let's go.

658
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Daffata.

659
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Why is the magic useless?

660
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The magic can't work.

661
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Because the air here is too cold.

662
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Now...

663
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
How can we save them?

664
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Let's carry them one by one.

665
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Let's go.

666
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, my God.

667
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's bad, sir.

668
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Jack and Hit are weakening.

669
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Mike, too.

670
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
This kid, too, sir.

671
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We have to hurry.

672
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
If we're late, these kids will die.

673
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, my God.

674
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Ray, you're out, too?

675
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yes.

676
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I don't want to eat vegetables.

677
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You don't want to eat vegetables?

678
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Vegetables are good for your health, Ray.

679
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Why do you have to eat vegetables?

680
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It's not good.

681
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Ray.

682
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Where's Alfa?

683
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Alfa has been locked up twice.

684
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It's been a long time.

685
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's better to just have fun.

686
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm sure I'll win.

687
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
This is called winning without fighting.

688
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm excited.

689
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
What if we become friends?

690
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But Alfa is afraid of me.

691
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I have a strange power.

692
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I can make everyone freeze.

693
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Now the school is frozen.

694
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But who's going to do it?

695
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The one who will do it is a fairy.

696
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
A fairy?

697
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Go, go, go.

698
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Achieve all your dreams.

699
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Go, go, go.

700
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Never stop.

701
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Go, go, go.

702
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Fight with all your might.

703
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Go, go, go.

704
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Make yourself proud.

705
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Go, go, go.

706
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Let's dream.

707
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Go, go, go.

708
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Let's dream.

709
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Go, go, go.

710
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Never stop.
