1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I want to have a strange power

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I can make everyone freeze

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because we are friends

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will let you know my secret

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I also have a strange power

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't freeze

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alva is safe

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Although his face is a little wounded

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Bad news

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The 8th prince has taken the news away

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We give time until tomorrow morning

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If our Kris doesn't return

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And our servants are no longer made normal

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We will attack the magic school

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And your teacher

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Your teacher will not return

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How is this possible?

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We can't give Kris that fire

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If we give Kris that fire

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Our children will be in danger

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Children can die of cold

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Plita must be lonely

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Poor Plita

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't leave Plita alone

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I have to help Plita

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
To be continued...

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Because he has a very high level of knowledge

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So...

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Professor Purwa can take care of himself

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We have no other choice, Rolf

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Whether we want it or not

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We have to fight them

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is all for the sake of the children and the school

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What?

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Professor Purwa was kidnapped?

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then?

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What about Plita?

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who is looking for her?

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A month later

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's safe

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We can open it

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Ouch

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It turns out that you guys

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Made us know

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're lucky

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You didn't ask us out

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We can't sleep either

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I miss Plita

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I miss her too

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Poor her

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She must be lonely

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's go find Plita

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We have to take responsibility

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We're the ones who brought her here

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're right

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's go

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's so cold

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My hands are freezing

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's cold

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wait

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Alfa

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Try to find her using the telescope

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Where is Plita now?

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There she is

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We brought her here

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Where are you taking her?

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How are we going to find her?

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's so cold

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We have to help her

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We can't give up

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's go

74
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's so cold

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't do this anymore

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's so cold

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's so cold

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's so cold

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What do we do?

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't do this anymore

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's so cold

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's so cold

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't do this anymore

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't leave me

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What do we do?

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's so cold

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's so cold

88
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's so cold

89
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's so cold

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's so cold

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They think I'm an ordinary person

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Where do you think you're going?

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Eka, Tri, Cato

94
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll deal with him

95
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll deal with him

96
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll deal with him

97
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's go

98
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's go

99
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Kara, nice to meet you again

100
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's go

101
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's go

102
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Children

103
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We brought food for all of you

104
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes

105
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We brought fruits

106
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Eat fruits so you'll be healthy

107
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's share it

108
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay

109
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But wait

110
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There's one more thing

111
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I want to ask you

112
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What is it?

113
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay

114
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But wait

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Where's Ray?

116
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

117
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Vega?

118
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He's not here

119
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We don't know

120
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh no

121
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is bad

122
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ika's son ate the fruit

123
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm sure they ran away

124
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They ran away

125
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Please share it

126
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Take it all

127
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm telling you all

128
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't trust Ankara

129
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He's a liar

130
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
A traitor

131
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't trust him

132
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't trust him

133
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He and all the people at the magic school

134
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All of them are liars

135
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Liars

136
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You've seen it for yourself

137
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The proof is

138
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He hid the ice in the school's school yard

139
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And that's a very clear proof

140
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And all of this is his doing

141
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Along with all the people at the magic school

142
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's a liar

143
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We didn't do that

144
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We didn't steal the ice

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's a traitor

146
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He did all of this

147
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What else can you prove, Purwa?

148
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Everything is clear

149
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ksatria Catur has seen for himself

150
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
How stupid he is

151
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And you have no reason to scream like this

152
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Just answer, Ankara

153
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Just answer

154
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Where are Purwa and Vega?

155
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Where are they?

156
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why did I get left behind?

157
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm so scared

158
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm scared

159
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm scared

160
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm scared

161
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm scared

162
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm scared

163
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm scared

164
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm scared

165
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm scared

166
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm scared

167
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Dad!

168
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Vega!

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Dad!

170
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Vega!

171
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Vega!

172
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why did I get left behind?

173
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This hole

174
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This hole

175
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Can tell me anything

176
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That I want

177
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I want to see Alva and Vega

178
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Where are they?

179
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Alva?

180
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Vega?

181
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Thank you for saving us

182
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Thank you

183
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You're so kind

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're welcome

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're our best friend

186
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Thank you

187
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're welcome

188
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're our best friend

189
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Vega, where's Rey?

190
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Why isn't she here?

191
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Where is she?

192
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Why don't we help her?

193
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Why are you guys like that?

194
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I feel sorry for Rey

195
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I feel sorry for her

196
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know

197
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We have to help you, Alva

198
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
We have to help you because we have to, Alva

199
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If it wasn't for Tiana's request

200
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We wouldn't have helped a guy

201
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Right, girls?

202
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Right

203
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Where is she?

204
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We have to find Rey

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What do we do?

206
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hi

207
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hi, Alva

208
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hi, Vega

209
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hi, Gangsa

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm so lucky

211
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I thought it was a girl

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
If it wasn't for her

213
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I would've been beaten up

214
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
How did you know we're here?

215
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Reyna

216
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Rey

217
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Reyna

218
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
How did you know we're here?

219
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What are you doing here?

220
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I know where you are

221
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because of this

222
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's dangerous

223
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Go back to school

224
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Because the weather is extreme

225
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We have to help Brita

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We have to help Brita

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
She's Asian

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Girls

229
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yippie

230
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yippie

231
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Girls

232
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Lotion

233
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
In the cold weather

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What is this for?

235
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The lotion can help you

236
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Stay warm in the cold weather

237
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So you can stay strong in the snow

238
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Wow

239
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's so cool

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're welcome

242
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's go

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Where is your friend?

244
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Wait, I'll look for her

245
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Where is she?

246
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Where is she?

247
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There she is

248
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
She's in the building

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What's her name?

250
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know

251
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Her name is...

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Kondok Hitam

253
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I know where she is

254
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
How do we get there?

255
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes

256
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We'll take you there

257
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's so cool

258
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Girls

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yippie

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yippie

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You can all go up now

262
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's so big

263
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes

264
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Girls

265
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Brita

266
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You have to be strong

267
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Brita

268
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You have to keep your emotions

269
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You can't be afraid

270
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can't be nervous

271
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And you can't care about others

272
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you care

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You'll be disappointed

274
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And you'll be hurt

275
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sure everything will be better

276
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Wow

277
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's so cool

278
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We can fly

279
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, we can fly

280
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
By the way

281
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Where did you get this kite?

282
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I was going to Kondok

283
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I remembered

285
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
My family doesn't like men

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I got this kite

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Where did you get it from?

289
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Brita

290
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's a red kite

291
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What's that?

292
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Help

293
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Help

294
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Help

295
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yippie

296
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yippie

297
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's not over yet

298
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh yeah

299
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I want to play with a kite

300
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's so funny

301
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You're so smart

302
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What's your name?

303
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Brita

304
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Brita

305
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Brita

306
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Have all the kids eaten?

307
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yes, Sir

308
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I think Prof. Radebaran is stressed

309
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because he's thinking about

310
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The great warriors

311
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I

312
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Have to keep it a secret

313
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
From Ray, Vega, and Alva

314
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Megantara

315
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Call Agni and Yasmin

316
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We have to get out of here

317
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because soon

318
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The great warriors will come

319
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We have to get out of here

320
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Megantara

321
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes, Sir

322
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yes, Sir

323
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Andri Madan

324
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Get out

325
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Get out, all of you

326
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Give Chris the kite

327
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'll count to ten

328
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If you don't give Chris the kite

329
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We will attack

330
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They will attack us

331
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We have to fight

332
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
If we don't

333
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Our school will be destroyed

334
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That's right, Professor

335
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And the students will be the victims

336
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Listen

337
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We are peacekeepers

338
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We don't want a war

339
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But

340
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We won't stay quiet

341
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
If there's someone who's threatening us

342
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We will use our abilities

343
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
To protect the students

344
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Let's go

345
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Let's unite

346
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We will protect this school and the students

347
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
For the future

348
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Boss, our school is under attack

349
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What?

350
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Attack?

351
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What are you doing?

352
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What are you doing?

353
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Chris, your kite

354
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Where's Chris?

355
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We decided to fight

356
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And protect Chris

357
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We will protect this school

358
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And protect the students

359
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
For the future

360
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We will protect this school

361
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And protect the students

362
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
For the future

363
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
We will protect this school

364
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We won't stop

365
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Until we have Chris

366
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
We must all unite

367
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Unite?

368
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Why, Aldi Baran?

369
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Are you afraid of losing?

370
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
How do you know I'm here?

371
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You're all useless

372
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Who do you think we are to lose?

373
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Professor Aldi Baran's ability

374
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
is far superior to yours

375
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I don't like this

376
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You see

377
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Everything is frozen

378
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We can't leave Chris

379
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And we need Chris Aldi

380
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
To take care of the kids

381
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
If not, they can die

382
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Okay

383
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We've released your teacher

384
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Thank you

385
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Now

386
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's time to find the kid named Plita

387
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yasmin

388
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Take care of the kids

389
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't let them leave this place

390
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Before it gets back to normal

391
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yes, Professor

392
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Damn it!

393
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They've united

394
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We can't let this happen

395
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I have to stop them

396
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Thank you for saving us

397
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You're so kind

398
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
For helping us

399
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You're welcome, Rega

400
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Rega

401
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If you need anything

402
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Don't hesitate to call us

403
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We'll definitely help you

404
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Girls

405
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Okay, bye

406
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Bye

407
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Bye, Plita

408
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So annoying

409
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Why do I have to be a girl?

410
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Plita!

411
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Plita, I want to talk to you

412
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Don't touch me

413
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What's wrong?

414
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Are you mad?

415
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Forgive us

416
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We left you yesterday

417
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But

418
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We're back now

419
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yes

420
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's better

421
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If you go back to school with us

422
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Will you?

423
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Because everyone is asking about you

424
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yes

425
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We miss you so much

426
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes

427
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Plita

428
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Let's play again

429
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I promise

430
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I won't leave you

431
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I promise

432
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You have to forget them all

433
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Who's that?

434
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Why does he bring Plita here?

435
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Plita

436
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You have to make a decision

437
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Do you want to stay here with me

438
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Or do you want to go to Someret?

439
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Plita

440
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You haven't forgotten, right?

441
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We promised

442
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We'll always be together

443
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Plita

444
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You have to focus on your recovery

445
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
He's a traitor

446
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Don't go with him

447
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You have to kick him out of this school

448
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You have to kick him out

449
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Guys

450
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let's just go

451
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Don't waste our time

452
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You guys go

453
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I want to stay here

454
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You have to stay with us

455
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes

456
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I want to stay here

457
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You guys go

458
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't want to

459
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I want to take you home

460
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
If you don't want to go, just go

461
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Plita

462
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Your hand

463
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Come here, I want to see

464
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Don't touch me

465
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Plita

466
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's okay

467
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Plita, why are you so stubborn?

468
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Do you know?

469
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
He's just a bad guy

470
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Who dares to attack his own friend

471
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm a bad guy

472
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
We came here because he's a bad guy

473
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He's not a bad guy

474
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
He's a bad guy

475
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But he can't control himself

476
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He's like a brother to me

477
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So, I want to protect him

478
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Plita

479
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Let's go home, Plita

480
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Let's go back to school

481
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Plita

482
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
If you don't want to go with them

483
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Just kick him out

484
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Monster S

485
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Monster S

486
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What should we do?

487
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Monster S

488
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Take them away from here

489
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Let's go

490
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Plita, don't

491
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay

492
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Monster

493
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Monster

494
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Monster

495
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Monster

496
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You have to think for yourself

497
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And you have to let go of your love for other people

498
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because this feeling can destroy you

499
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Monster

500
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Monster

501
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Monster

502
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Let me go

503
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Let me go

504
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Let me go

505
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What you're doing now is right

506
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You have to train yourself so that you can recover

507
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You're safe now, Vega, Kharva, and Kary

508
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I can't go any further

509
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I've come this far just to be kicked out by Plita

510
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Let's report this to the police

511
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes, let's report this to the police

512
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Vega

513
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Vega

514
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Vega

515
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Vega

516
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Vega

517
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Vega

518
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Vega

519
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Vega

520
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Vega

521
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Vega

522
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Stay there

523
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I want to see Plita

524
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Move

525
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Move

526
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I want to see Plita

527
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Move

528
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
No

529
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Why?

530
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You're awesome

531
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
When are you going to learn how to swim?

532
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Because

533
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I often see the army

534
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I can do it

535
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's better

536
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If we go home now

537
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
After school

538
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
No

539
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't want to go home

540
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't want to go home if I don't bring Plita

541
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Come on, Vega

542
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You heard it yourself

543
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Plita doesn't want to talk to you anymore

544
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's better if we go home

545
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You're always being teased by Plita

546
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Alva is right

547
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Let's go home

548
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
No, I don't want to

549
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I want to talk to Plita again

550
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
If you don't want to bring me

551
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Fine

552
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll go by myself

553
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm so scared

554
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Somebody help!

555
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Alva, help!

556
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What should we do?

557
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Let's attack together

558
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What?

559
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Attack!

560
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yes!

561
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
We did it!

562
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yes!

563
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Great!

564
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Great!

565
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Forever

566
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yes, forever!

567
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes!

568
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yes!

569
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Great!

570
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Alva!

571
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
We did it!

572
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We did it!

573
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We did it!

574
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We did it!

575
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You can't think of anything

576
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You have to concentrate

577
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
My hand is healed

578
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Thank you, Mr. Ngeran

579
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm glad I can help you

580
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
But you have to remember

581
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You can't use your feelings

582
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You have to control yourself

583
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You have to think of yourself

584
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And you have to let go of your love for people

585
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Because those feelings can destroy you

586
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It can make you hurt

587
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It can make you sad

588
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yes, Mr. Ngeran

589
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We can do it

590
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Let's gather here

591
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's over

592
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Fire

593
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay

594
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'll get some water

595
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And make a drink

596
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It smells good

597
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yes, of course

598
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This drink not only warms your body

599
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But also boosts your stamina

600
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Can I try?

601
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Sure, go ahead

602
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Be careful, it's hot

603
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Thank you

604
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Agni?

605
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Agni?

606
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Mr. Agni?

607
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Agni?

608
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Mr. Agni?

609
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Agni?

610
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Mr. Agni?

611
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You intentionally hurt Agni

612
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yes, we did

613
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You're such a jerk

614
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Don't blame us

615
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Shut up!

616
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I don't know anything about this

617
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
The evidence is clear

618
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You can't escape

619
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It's all because of me

620
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Good

621
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Keep fighting

622
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
You can't fight each other

623
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You have to surrender

624
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You have to surrender

625
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What's wrong, Tri?

626
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Nothing

627
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Enough

628
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Enough!

629
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Enough!

630
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Enough!

631
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Stop it!

632
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Stop it!

633
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Hold your emotions

634
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I can cure Agni

635
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You must have misunderstood

636
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We should be united

637
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Agni

638
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Agni

639
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Agni

640
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Agni

641
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Agni

642
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Agni

643
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Agni

644
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Agni

645
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Agni

646
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Agni

647
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Agni

648
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Agni

649
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Agni

650
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Agni

651
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Agni

652
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Agni

653
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It hurts

654
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm sick of this

655
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm going home

656
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Let's go home

657
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Where are you going?

658
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Let me go

659
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I want to take Plita home

660
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Vega

661
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You don't have to do that

662
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
The monster has attacked you

663
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It attacked all of us

664
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
If we go there again

665
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We'll get sick

666
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Let's go home

667
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
No, I still want to try

668
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm sure Plita is a good girl

669
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
She has a soft heart

670
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So, I want to talk to her

671
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Just the two of us

672
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Men shouldn't know

673
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
What does it have to do with men?

674
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm sure

675
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Men must be the ones who affect Plita

676
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You saw that, right?

677
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Plita is very close to men

678
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Alright

679
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'll go with you

680
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Really?

681
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Alright, I'll go with you too

682
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yes, you're going with me

683
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yes

684
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But, how do we get there?

685
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I'm sure the monster is over there

686
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
How about this?

687
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Ray and I will lure the monster

688
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So, the monster will chase us

689
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You'll take Plita home

690
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yes, I agree

691
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Best

692
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Friends

693
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Forever

694
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Best friends forever

695
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yes

696
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Devastate

697
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Vega, let's go

698
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Vega

699
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
What?

700
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
What?

701
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
What?

702
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
What?

703
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
What?

704
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Zeru

705
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
What?

706
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Zeru

707
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
What?

708
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What?

709
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Zeru, run!

710
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Where are we?

711
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We're here

712
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Do you want to play?

713
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Plita

714
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Plita

715
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Come here

716
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Let's play

717
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Come on, Plita

718
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Let's play

719
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Or do you want to walk?

720
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Or do you want me to walk?

721
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Come here

722
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I'll spin the dice

723
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yes

724
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
6

725
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
1

726
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
2

727
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
3

728
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
4

729
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
5

730
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
6

731
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'll walk again

732
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'll spin the dice

733
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yes

734
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
4

735
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
1

736
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
2

737
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
3

738
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
4

739
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yes, on the 10th

740
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Now it's your turn, Plita

741
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes

742
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
5

743
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
1

744
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
2

745
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
3

746
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
4

747
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
5

748
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yay

749
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Are you happy playing this?

750
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm really happy

751
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Especially when you play this at school, Plita

752
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It must be more fun

753
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
There are a lot of kids playing

754
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yes

755
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That's why

756
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You should go home, Plita

757
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We can play together again

758
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You should go home, Plita

759
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Please

760
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We've promised that we'll always be friends

761
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I don't want you to be lonely

762
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
You should go home

763
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Please

764
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We can play together again

765
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Let's go, Plita

766
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Okay

767
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So, you want to go with Vega?

768
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yes, it's all up to you

769
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But you have to remember my words

770
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You can't use your feelings

771
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Because your feelings

772
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Will only hurt you

773
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And you can't care about others

774
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Because caring about others

775
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Will only make you sad

776
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'm sorry, Sir

777
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But I can't leave Vega

778
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's okay

779
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Use this

780
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
If you need my help

781
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Use this

782
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I'll come and help you

783
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Wherever you are

784
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Thank you, Sir

785
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Audrey!

786
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Let me go!

787
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Let me go!

788
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Let me go!

789
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Let me go!

790
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Let me go!

791
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Let me go!

792
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Let me go!

793
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Are you okay?

794
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm okay, Sir

795
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I just sprained my ankle

796
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm sorry

797
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's okay

798
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Now, Plita wants to go home with us

799
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That's great!

800
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But don't hold my hand

801
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You'll get cold

802
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yes

803
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
We'll meet Professor Lelebaran there

804
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm sure Professor Lelebaran

805
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Can cure you

806
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Let's go home

807
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm so happy to be with you

808
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Me too

809
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Especially me

810
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Sir

811
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Come here

812
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Can I ask you for a favor?

813
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
What is it?

814
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Can you find Professor Lelebaran?

815
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You tell him

816
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That we're on our way home

817
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
About Plita

818
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Okay

819
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Thank you, Sir

820
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You're welcome, Alfa

821
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
There's a message from Alfa

822
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Alfa is on his way home with Plita

823
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Megantama

824
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Why is Alfa outside the school?

825
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Actually, I wanted to tell you this morning

826
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But...

827
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
The EOF is in a hurry

828
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So...

829
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I forgot

830
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Tell Alfa

831
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'll be waiting for him

832
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
In this bamboo forest

833
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Okay, Sir

834
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Thank you

835
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
You're welcome, Sir

836
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
We should take a rest here

837
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
While we wait for Alfa and Plita

838
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Megantama

839
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Next time

840
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You have to tell me everything

841
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Okay

842
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Make sure it's clean

843
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'll keep you posted

844
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Alfa

845
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Where are you?

846
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm on my way home

847
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Okay, Sir

848
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Thank you, Sir

849
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You're welcome

850
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Megantama

851
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Where are you?

852
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I'm on my way home

853
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Okay, Sir

854
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Make sure it's clean

855
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'll keep you posted

856
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Megantama

857
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Where are you?

858
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm on my way home

859
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Okay, Sir

860
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Make sure it's clean

861
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I'll keep you posted

862
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Okay, Sir

863
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Megantama

864
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Where are you?

865
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I'm on my way home

866
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Okay, Sir

867
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Make sure it's clean

868
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I'll keep you posted

869
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Okay, Sir

870
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Let me help him

871
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
No need

872
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Leave it to me

873
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You want revenge, don't you?

874
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Hey

875
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Go to Gandaria

876
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Buy a sharp sword

877
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Ksatria

878
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Remember

879
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Slander is worse than murder

880
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You can see for yourself

881
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
This is slander, not slander

882
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Okay

883
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Let's go our separate ways

884
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We'll use our own methods

885
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Wait, Professor

886
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Just leave it

887
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
We don't need to be stopped

888
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
For what?

889
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We should be united

890
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Not separate like this

891
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I'm not in the mood

892
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yeah

893
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
They're looking for trouble

894
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Where's Siri?

895
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Maybe he's taking a nap

896
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
He'll be here soon

897
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You guys go first

898
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Let's go, Prita

899
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Alva

900
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Alva

901
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Alva

902
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Hey

903
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Where's Alva?

904
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Ray's gone

905
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
He attacked Alva

906
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
What should we do?

907
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
What should we do?

908
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Prita, wait here

909
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I'll look for Ray and Alva

910
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Alva

911
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Ray

912
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Ray

913
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Alva

914
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Alva

915
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Ray

916
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Where are you guys?

917
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Alva, Ray

918
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Alva

919
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Ray

920
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Alva, Ray

921
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Where are you guys?

922
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Where are you guys?

923
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Who are you?

924
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Don't move

925
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Don't make noise

926
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Where's the cafe?

927
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It's taking too long

928
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Let me go

929
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Help

930
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Help

931
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Shut up

932
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
If you call them

933
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They'll come for you

934
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Maybe this is a trap

935
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
The cafe, Ray and Alva

936
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Are working with these people

937
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Why are they here?

938
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I trust the cafe

939
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Alva

940
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Alva

941
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Alva

942
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Alva

943
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Finally, Prita called

944
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Alva

945
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Alva

946
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Alva

947
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Alva

948
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Alva

949
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Alva

950
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Help me, Eran

951
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Prita

952
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You have to gather your strength

953
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And attack them

954
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Now, attack the people who hurt you

955
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Prita is so brave

956
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
She made Vega become like this

957
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I told you

958
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
She's a monster

959
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
That's why we have to stay away from her

960
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
She's not a friend

961
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
She's running, jumping, jumping

962
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
She's a monster

963
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
She's brave

964
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
She never gives up

965
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
She's chasing her dreams

966
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Go, go, go

967
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Chase all your dreams

968
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Go, go, go

969
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Never stop

970
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Go, go, go

971
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Fight with your heart

972
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Go, go, go

973
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Make yourself proud

974
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Go, go, go

975
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Let's dream

976
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Go, go, go

977
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
We will
