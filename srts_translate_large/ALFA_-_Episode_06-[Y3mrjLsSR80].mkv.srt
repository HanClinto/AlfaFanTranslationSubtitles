1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Heart's strength

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Make yourself proud

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go, go, go

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's dream

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Go, go, go

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can do it

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Stop, stop

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sure

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Duyung are only in war

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Run

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It seems there is a greater power

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That controls them

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Terror will continue to spread

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Until I can get the chosen one

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you see where Duyung is going?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Down to the lake

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everyone wants to attack the Duyung

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why don't they show up?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Be patient

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We'll wait a little longer

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They will definitely show up to kill him

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be patient

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
To be continued...

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They are very cunning

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's hide first

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Once they show up, we attack

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Agreed

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What are you doing?

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now answer my question

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Where did you hide the students?

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't play around

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Answer my question

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you think you can play around?

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Fine

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will teach you

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Fire

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't hurt them

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They want to pray

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Putri Duyung

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Putri Duyung

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Putri Duyung, are you okay?

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you for saving me

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
With your tears

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I promise

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will set you free

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Along with your friends

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Vega

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Retreat

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hurry

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Retreat

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Retreat

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hurry

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We're here to save our friends

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Good

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If we retreat

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Duyung's people will be punished

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We can't hurt Duyung

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We have to work with them

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You don't know how to teach me

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Professor Purwa

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's not our fault

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We don't have much time

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you lie

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You will be punished

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Fire

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Retreat

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They went to their house

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What are we going to do?

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We can't just fight

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's why

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We have to listen to their opinions

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They are still kids

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But sometimes

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They are smarter than adults

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Alpha

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ask them

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Where are our friends?

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Duyung

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please tell me

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where are our friends that you kidnapped?

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you doing?

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you playing?

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Calm down

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Duyung can't talk

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Lightning

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It seems

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What Alpha said is true

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They are not lying

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But they can't talk

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because of one thing

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
How can they lose their voices?

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Why can't you talk?

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who is he?

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Did you order him?

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you want me to read your mind?

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Duyung

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Duyung

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Help

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Help us

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Help us

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So because of that attack

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can't talk?

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Duyung

108
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The 8th Prince's order

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I stole your voices

111
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And if you want your voices back

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You have to kidnap 8 kids from a magic school

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And one of those kids

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Must be a boy named Alpha

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Those kids

117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You have to bring them to the headquarters of the 8th Prince

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which is located in

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That headquarters is a secret

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can't tell anyone

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And if one of you leak it

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Then

124
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
All of you will be cursed to be bullies

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hahaha

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The 8th Prince's order says that you have to kidnap 8 kids

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Which means

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You have to kidnap 2 boys

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And one of them must be a boy named Alpha

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Duyung

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hurry Duyung

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hurry

133
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Duyung

134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What are you doing?

135
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Alpha

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hurry up

137
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Duyung

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hurry up

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Duyung

140
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Duyung

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Food

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Thank you

143
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Hurry up

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hurry up

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Kristi

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Grass again

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Grass again

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's no other

150
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What?

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why do we have to be like this?

152
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We're not happy

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm ready, ma'am

154
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm also

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I've learned the vocabulary

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So

157
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sure

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can protect myself

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Alpha is not alone

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll protect him

162
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The dragon fruit

163
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh my god

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's dangerous

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't worry, soldier

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We've fought the three-headed dragon

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So we're sure

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think there's no other choice

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll count to three

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If there's no better idea

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We'll use Alpha's idea

173
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Professor Purwa

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
One

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Two

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Three

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We'll use Alpha's idea

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Alpha Taung Poveris

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've set up a shield

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And a trap for you

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Alpha

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Vega

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Wait

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Alpha

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Vega

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You have to be careful

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I promise

188
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll save you

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Putri Ruyung

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's get out of here

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Take us

193
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
To the Dark Mountain

194
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What should we do?

195
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't want Alpha to get hurt

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I can't tell him where we're going

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hurry, Putri Ruyung

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We don't have much time

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We have to save my friend

201
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Hurry, Putri Ruyung

202
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We don't have much time

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We have to save my friend

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Alpha Taung Poveris

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Good

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Very good

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Finally, I succeeded in saving Putri Ruyung

208
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Give her to me

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Mom

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm scared too

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We're all scared

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And hungry

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Mom, Karim

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Listen, Karim

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I heard your voice

216
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I was wondering how to get out of here

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I've been crying

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I want to go home

219
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to go home

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What happened?

221
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They must know about the trap

222
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And they deliberately destroyed it

223
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Without the trap

224
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
How can we save them?

225
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This is all because of Professor Purwa

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Because of you, Purwa

227
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because of you, Purwa

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Because of you, Purwa

229
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because of you, Purwa

230
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Because of you, Purwa

231
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because of you, Purwa

232
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because of you, Purwa

233
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Because of you, Purwa

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Alpha's life is in danger

235
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Megantara

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What do you mean?

237
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is not my fault

238
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But that's the truth

239
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You accused me

240
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was trying to save the children

241
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Megantara

242
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Listen, listen

243
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What are you doing?

244
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Don't touch me

245
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Go, go, go

246
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Achieve all your dreams

247
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Go, go, go

248
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Never stop

249
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Go, go, go

250
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Fight with all your might

251
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Go, go, go

252
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Make yourself proud

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Go, go, go

254
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Go, go, go

255
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Go, go, go

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Go, go, go

257
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Go, go, go

258
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Go, go, go

259
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Remember

260
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't be afraid

261
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If you dare to do anything

262
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I will turn you into fish

263
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Don't

264
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm hungry

266
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I want to eat again

267
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Alpha

268
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Mega

269
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Mega

270
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Mega

271
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Mega, wake up

272
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It hurts

273
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Where are we?

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We're in a village

275
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Where's our village?

276
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, right

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Where's my village?

278
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't

279
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We'll get caught

280
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Bro, if we lose this village

281
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The teachers won't know where we are

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We won't be safe

283
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We don't know where we are

284
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Go, go, go

285
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We're cut off

286
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Open it

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Shut up

288
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Remember

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
If you dare to do anything

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I will turn you into fish

291
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Don't be afraid

292
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Weapons

293
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Go

294
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Go, go, go

295
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Go, go, go

296
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Go, go, go

297
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Weapons

298
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Now

299
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You can't turn us into fish

300
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Guys

301
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's get out of here

302
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Wait

303
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's not that easy

304
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's not that easy

305
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Professor Rangkara

306
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Alpha

307
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Thank you for still recognizing me

308
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Professor

309
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Why are you here?

310
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You should be in prison

311
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes

312
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You underestimated me

313
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
A prison like that

314
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Is nothing to me

315
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And you, Alpha

316
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Don't be happy

317
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Because you took my Tongsi

318
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Because without Tongsi

319
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I can still use my magic

320
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Go back, Rizal

321
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Suck their energy

322
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Rizal

323
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What should I do?

324
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I feel sorry for Alpha and Vega

325
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They are my friends

326
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But if I tell them about their secret

327
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I...

328
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Shut up!

329
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Shut up!

330
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Vega!

331
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Alpha and Vega

332
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Rekobot, attack!

333
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What's wrong with this robot?

334
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's useless if you two fight

335
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay, let's find where the kids are

336
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But what should we do?

337
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We have no other choice

338
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
He told us to follow him

339
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
He knows where the kids are

340
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Let's go

341
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Okay

342
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Wait!

343
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
What if it's a trap?

344
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Do you have a better idea?

345
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hurry!

346
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What is this place?

347
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It must be a trap!

348
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He told us to follow him

349
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He's one of our supporters

350
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
He told you to press the stone

351
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
If you lie to us

352
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You will be punished

353
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Rekobot, attack!

354
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
To be honest

355
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
There's something wrong

356
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Who is it?

357
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Even though I've destroyed the company

358
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
How do you know?

359
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Let's go

360
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Rekobot, attack!

361
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Let's go in

362
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
How do we get out?

363
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We have to break the stone

364
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's go

365
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
We have to get out of there

366
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Let me do it!

367
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We have to get out of here!

368
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm going to be a robot

369
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm going to be a robot

370
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm going to be a robot

371
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm going to be a robot!

372
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Ankara?

373
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Ankara?

374
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
There are two roads

375
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Which one should we take?

376
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We should split up

377
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Wait

378
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I think that's the smoke

379
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
A message from the children

380
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Let's just follow the smoke

381
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So we don't have to split up

382
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Let's go

383
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So Professor Ankara

384
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Escaped from prison?

385
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Don't you dare

386
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The darkness won't rise again

387
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because you've caught me

388
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The horror won't end here

389
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
In the end

390
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You will lose

391
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Kidnapping the children

392
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Must be done by Ankara

393
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Don't be afraid

394
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Let me deal with this

395
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Let's go

396
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Everything is ready

397
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Let's continue our journey

398
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Let's go

399
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't be afraid!

400
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Let's use the power of water

401
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay

402
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Let's go

403
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Mupunjo, water!

404
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Mupunjo, water!

405
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Mupunjo, water!

406
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Thank you.

407
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
How dare you!

408
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Angkara?

409
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So, you're the one behind all this.

410
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Angkara, you managed to escape from the jail.

411
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Hahaha...

412
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Hey, you're underestimating my magic power.

413
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Do you think I can't escape from such a cheap prison?

414
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Hahaha...

415
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Angkara, let me handle this.

416
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You guys, save the kids.

417
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Hurry up.

418
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You guys, go!

419
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Let's go.

420
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Hurry up.

421
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Let's go.

422
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The coconut was eaten.

423
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Where do you think you're going, Angkara?

424
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Avancur Bintu.

425
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Let's go.

426
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Wait.

427
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Isn't this the energy transfer crystal?

428
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This weapon is very dangerous.

429
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
This crystal can collect the energy of the people who want it.

430
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And it can absorb all the energy.

431
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
We don't have much time.

432
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We have to destroy this crystal ball.

433
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Because if the crystal ball is full,

434
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it means the energy of the children has been taken.

435
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
The children could die.

436
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I will destroy it.

437
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Avancur!

438
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Let's attack.

439
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Avancur!

440
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Avancur!

441
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Avancur!

442
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Good bye, Professor Megantara.

443
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Go to Japan through the north.

444
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's easy to defeat Megantara.

445
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Let's go.

446
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's destroy it together.

447
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Let's go.

448
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Avancur!

449
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Let's go.

450
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Let's go together.

451
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Tommy.

452
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Tommy.

453
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Are you okay?

454
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Are you okay?

455
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Avancur!

456
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It seems that the destruction of the crystal has destroyed this place.

457
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We have to get out of here.

458
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Let's go.

459
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Let's go.

460
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Let's go.

461
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Let's go.

462
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Let's go.

463
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Let's go.

464
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Avancur!

465
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Let's go.

466
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Vega.

467
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Vega.

468
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Professor!

469
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Megantara is still inside.

470
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Megantara is still inside.

471
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes.

472
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
He's fighting against Ankara.

473
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Megantara.

474
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Alva!

475
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Alva!

476
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Alva!

477
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Alva!

478
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Megantara!

479
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Megantara!

480
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Megantara!

481
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Megantara!

482
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Where are you?

483
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Megantara!

484
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Alva.

485
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Megantara!

486
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Alva.

487
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm here!

488
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Megantara.

489
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Megantara!

490
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Megantara!

491
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Megantara.

492
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Alva.

493
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Professor!

494
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm here, Professor!

495
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Thank you, Professor.

496
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Here, Megantara.

497
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The road is closed.

498
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
What should we do, Professor?

499
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Alva.

500
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Professor.

501
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Look.

502
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
There's a hole.

503
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The hole needs people.

504
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Alva.

505
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Come on.

506
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Go inside that hole.

507
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Hurry.

508
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Come on, Professor.

509
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Go inside.

510
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Follow Alva.

511
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
No, Megantara.

512
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You go inside.

513
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You can take care of him.

514
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Professor.

515
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Go inside, Professor.

516
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Stay in the middle.

517
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Where are you, Professor?

518
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Professor.

519
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Where are you, Professor?

520
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Professor.

521
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
No!

522
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Don't sting me!

523
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm sorry, Megantara.

524
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Megantara.

525
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Don't leave me, Megantara.

526
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Megantara.

527
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Get up, Megantara.

528
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You promised...

529
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
...to give me a future.

530
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Megantara.

531
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Get up, Megantara.

532
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
We have to go, Alva.

533
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
We have to go.

534
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Alva, wait!

535
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Alva.

536
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Alva!

537
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Megantara!

538
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Megantara, get up!

539
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Megantara.

540
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Megantara, get up, Megantara.

541
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Megantara.

542
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Megantara, wake up.

543
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Megantara.

544
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Megantara, get up.

545
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Megantara, wake up Megantara.

546
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Megantara, wake up.

547
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Megantara.

548
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
What are you doing?

549
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Megantara.

550
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Be careful, don't push me like this.

551
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'll beat you up.

552
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Hey, Prof.

553
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Coconut fruit.

554
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Coconut fruit.

555
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Alva.

556
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Don't cry.

557
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Why are you smiling?

558
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I've promised you...

559
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
...that I'll save you all.

560
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Captain Megantara...

561
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
...never breaks his promise.

562
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Okay.

563
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Where's your tux?

564
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Where's your tux?

565
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Captain Megantara.

566
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Are you all okay?

567
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Putih Duyung, you can talk now?

568
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yes.

569
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm sure it's because the effect of the magic is gone.

570
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The place is destroyed.

571
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Thank you, Putih Duyung.

572
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm so happy...

573
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
...that you've saved us all.

574
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
My name is Utiara.

575
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm so happy to meet you.

576
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Let's come here again sometime.

577
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Right, Alva?

578
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yes, I'm happy to meet you too.

579
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You're good kids.

580
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I'm also thankful that you saved me.

581
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Utiara.

582
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
What's wrong?

583
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Are you sick?

584
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Utiara.

585
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Utiara.

586
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Utiara.

587
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Where are you?

588
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's all because of the Dark Lord's curse.

589
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Utiara has leaked the kids' whereabouts.

590
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And now...

591
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
...he's being possessed.

592
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Utiara.

593
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's better than nothing.

594
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's better than nothing?

595
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Let's just play.

596
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
What if we go to an island?

597
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
We won't be there.

598
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I don't want to.

599
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I don't want to go to an island.

600
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I don't want to.

601
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I don't want to go to an island.

602
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'll miss you, Utiara.

603
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I don't want to.

604
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
He left me.

605
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Fine.

606
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
If you don't want to play, let me.

607
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Don't.

608
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Don't do that again.

609
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Don't.

610
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Don't hurt me again.

611
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Don't be afraid.

612
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We're not human anymore.

613
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Are you serious?

614
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yes.

615
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Are you alone?

616
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
What else can I do?

617
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Because...

618
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm alone.

619
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm alone.

620
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because...

621
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Alka and Vega are still sad.

622
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Because Utiara is possessed.

623
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Don't say that.

624
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Come here.

625
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I want to talk to you.

626
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
What?

627
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm going to leave, Alva, Vega.

628
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I'm going to be a ghost.

629
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Please, don't go.

630
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Please, Utiara, don't go.

631
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Utiara, I'm sad.

632
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm sad.

633
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Let's go.

634
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Let's go.

635
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Alva, Vega.

636
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
What a surprise.

637
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I have a new surprise for you.

638
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm sure...

639
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you won't regret it.

640
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
No.

641
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
We're going to Asrama Purnama.

642
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Me too.

643
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's true.

644
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
You don't want to meet Utiara.

645
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Don't lie.

646
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It's true, I'm not lying.

647
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Be careful.

648
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But, on one condition.

649
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
What is it?

650
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Do you want to be a girl?

651
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
That's not funny.

652
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It's true.

653
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Just follow me.

654
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Is that a boy or not?

655
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't know.

656
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't feel good.

657
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Hurry up, Rey.

658
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Where's Utiara?

659
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Rey, if you're lying,

660
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'll tie you to a tree.

661
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Just wait.

662
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
They'll be here soon.

663
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
What?

664
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
They.

665
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
They.

666
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Let's go.

667
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
A FEW HOURS LATER

668
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
That's Utiara.

669
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Utiara.

670
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Remember what I said?

671
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I met Putri Duyung.

672
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
She told me...

673
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
if a girl from Angsa...

674
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
takes Utiara's girl,

675
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Utiara can live again.

676
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Then, Utiara...

677
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
becomes a member of Angsa.

678
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Hurry up.

679
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Come here.

680
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'll wait for you here.

681
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
They don't like men.

682
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Let's go.

683
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
A FEW HOURS LATER

684
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm happy to see you again.

685
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Now!

686
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Now!

687
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's so fun!

688
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
There's another man!

689
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
A FEW HOURS LATER

690
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Thank you, Rey.

691
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm so happy to meet Utiara.

692
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Me too.

693
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Even though it's just for a while.

694
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But I'm happy because he's a good boy.

695
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I know.

696
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But my body aches.

697
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
A FEW HOURS LATER

698
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Attention, children.

699
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Starting tomorrow,

700
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
you'll have a mid-semester vacation.

701
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And you'll do a field trip...

702
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
to Sihir village, not far from the school.

703
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
There, you'll stay at the residence...

704
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and hang out with the people of Sihir.

705
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Professor Agni, Purwa, and Megantara...

706
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
will accompany you...

707
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
to keep an eye on you...

708
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
so that you don't do anything stupid.

709
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Do you understand?

710
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yes, sir.

711
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
There will be a sports competition in the village.

712
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It will be fun.

713
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
There are a lot of activities.

714
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm so excited.

715
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It will be fun.

716
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I can't wait to go there.

717
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Let's go!

718
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Any news?

719
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I just got word...

720
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
that the children from Sihir school...

721
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
will start a field trip to Sihir village.

722
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And I think...

723
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
we can attack Alpha there.

724
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I don't want to fail this time.

725
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So that I can regain my strength.

726
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I have to get that child.

727
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Don't worry, sir.

728
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'll give you whatever you want.

729
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I'll give you whatever you want.

730
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Alpha.

731
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Alpha.

732
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
How did you get in here?

733
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Don't get too close, Alpha.

734
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Why?

735
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's dangerous, Alpha.

736
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Please, don't go there.

737
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
But why?

738
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Most of the children here go on field trips.

739
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
What if I don't go?

740
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The event must be fun.

741
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Alright.

742
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I'll keep you safe.

743
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Hey!

744
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Where is he?

745
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It's just a dream.

746
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But...

747
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
does that mean...

748
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm not allowed to go on a field trip?

749
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Why?

750
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Those two...

751
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
always show up in my dreams...

752
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and give me a hard time.

753
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Children.

754
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
We'll leave soon.

755
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
On the count of three...

756
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
we'll go to Sihir village.

757
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
On the count of three...

758
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
we'll chant the mantra together.

759
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
One.

760
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Two.

761
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Three.

762
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Fly!

763
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Sihir Village

764
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
They're here.

765
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yes.

766
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It's like a prophecy.

767
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It means...

768
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
one of them...

769
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
will open the door...

770
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and make chaos in this village.

771
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Nik.

772
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Now, go to Sihir village.

773
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
His name is Pak Galaksi.

774
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Tell him we're here.

775
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And then...

776
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
come back here.

777
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Yes, ma'am.

778
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Children.

779
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Let's see.

780
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Sihir Village

781
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
There's someone over there.

782
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It's noisy.

783
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Janik!

784
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Faiqa!

785
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Faiqa!

786
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
What?

787
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Where are you?

788
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
We can't be separated.

789
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
We have to stay together.

790
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Let's go.

791
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Faiqa!

792
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Janik!

793
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Janik!

794
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
That's Janik's bag.

795
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Yes.

796
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Sihir Village

797
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Janik.

798
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Janik.

799
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Janik.

800
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Why is Janik turning into a rock?

801
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Maybe she needs it.

802
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Sihir Village

803
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Sihir Village

804
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It turns out the prophecy is true.

805
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
The disaster is here.

806
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
We're all going to be affected by the monster's curse.

807
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That's right.

808
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That's the legendary monster.

809
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
What did those people mean?

810
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
What's a legendary monster?

811
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
What really happened to me?

812
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Don't worry.

813
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Megantan will be back.

814
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Who are you?

815
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I'm Megantan.

816
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You're amazing.

817
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
How is it going with Kanik?

818
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It's a good time to come here.

819
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I have a clue about what happened.

820
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Come here.

821
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
To be continued...

822
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
To be continued...
