00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The power of heart

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Go Go Go

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Make your proud

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go Go Go

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's dream

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Go Go Go

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can do it

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What are you dreaming?

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Barga is a strong monster

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He is the hand of the dark

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He is the hand of the dark

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He can beat him

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is the hand of the dark

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He is the hand of the dark

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Who is he?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alpha

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tonight

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Before the sun goes down

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You have to go back to the secret room

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You have to go back to the secret room

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And take the stone of eternity for me

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And take the stone of eternity for me

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ouch

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you doing there?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What are you doing there?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When will you kill me?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ouch

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ouch

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ouch

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why did you realize that?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You fainted

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I did faint

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But because you hit me

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But because you hit me

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I got hurt

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let me cast a spell

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let me cast a spell

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Dangdut Dafang

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Dangdut Dafang

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why is it so hot?

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's because you casted the wrong spell

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's because you casted the wrong spell

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Dafang Tanduk

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is the right one

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Dafang

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Dafang

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Dangdut

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Dafang

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Dangdut

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Dafang

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How do I catch it?

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Dafang

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Dangdut

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Dafang

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Dafang

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Dangdut

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dafang

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Dafang

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Dafang

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh my God!

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't stand it anymore!

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh my God!

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What kind of poison is this?

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is poison from the Three-Headed Dragon.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What? Three-Headed Dragon?

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh my God!

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh my God!

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The Three-Headed Dragon's poison hasn't been cured yet.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You better go to Megantara now.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you mean?

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I mean Captain Megantara.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because he's the guardian of Megantara, the dragon.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hurry!

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, I'll go to Megantara now.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go, go, go!

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Megantara

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Megantara

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Megantara

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh my God!

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I need to concentrate.

84
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now, by listening to this, I can know what's behind it.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Dafang!

86
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Megantara

87
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Megantara

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Megantara

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Megantara

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Megantara

91
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Megantara

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Megantara

93
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Megantara

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The Myth

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Here!

96
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The Myth

97
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Tentara!

98
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Tentara!

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Tentara!

100
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Ouch!

101
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Tentara!

102
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tentara!

103
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Tentara!

104
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ouch!

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Tentara, wake up!

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ouch!

107
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Tentara, wake up!

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Burung Kutilang Burung Parkit

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because of you, the roasted chicken lost a sore butt

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Please, Tentara, help me!

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm Tentara

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I got hit by a three-headed dragon

113
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And then, Dr. Pertiwi doesn't have a cure

114
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's why I'm asking for help

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What's the story?

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why did he enter the forbidden room?

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Because we want to take...

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We?

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You mean, not just Shireya?

120
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Explain

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Who are we?

123
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We are...

124
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Me, Rey...

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And Alfa

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Alfa?

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Alfa is looking for trouble

128
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ouch!

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Tentara, Alfa is not wrong

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He went in there...

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Just to take the stone from you

132
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Come...

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Alfa...

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Tentara, where are you going?

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Tentara, Tentara!

136
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Tentara, where are you going?

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's wrong, Tentara?

138
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Tentara, where are those angels?

139
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They are not angels

140
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But they are...

141
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Angel girls

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Angel girls?

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Angel girls

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
See?

146
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They turned into beautiful girls

147
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Vega, now it's your turn

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You have to approach them

149
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You have to figure out a way to get them to the clinic

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
To cure Rey

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why me, Tentara?

152
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I already know you

153
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Just call me Tentara

154
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Here's the problem

155
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They are...

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Unlikable creatures

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And masculine creatures

158
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like me

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Especially if I'm handsome

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They will be allergic

161
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Enough

162
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't think too much

163
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Do you want to cure Rey?

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come here

165
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hey, who are you?

166
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you the one who called us here?

167
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes, I am

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Because I really need your help

169
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
My friend is a three-headed dragon

170
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Only you can cure my friend

171
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why do we have to help you?

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We don't even know you

173
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Come on

174
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please

175
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Please

176
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I promise

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will do whatever you want

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Please

179
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's right

180
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You can do whatever you want

181
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes

182
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you want to do whatever we want

184
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You have to make us happy and laugh

185
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But how?

186
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Think about it

187
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We haven't laughed for a long time

188
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Right, girls?

189
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's right

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It won't take long

191
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll count to three

192
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If not, we'll leave

193
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
How?

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
One

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Two

196
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Enough

197
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Wait

198
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Follow me

199
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll make you laugh

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right

201
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I can do it

202
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Trust me

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Come on

204
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's go

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sorry, Tentara

206
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Men!

207
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm not a man

208
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
How are you?

209
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You said you're tired of men

210
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What are you waiting for?

211
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Beat him up

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't

213
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Attack

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What are you doing?

216
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Don't

217
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What are you doing?

218
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He's gone

220
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I've made you laugh

221
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now, help my friend

222
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What are you doing?

223
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes

224
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Quick

225
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes

226
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yes

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We are

228
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes

229
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes, yes

230
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We are

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes

232
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes

233
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you

234
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Thank you

235
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Thank you

236
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's nothing

237
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So now, please tell me

238
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why are you in that room?

239
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Here's the thing

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Alva said

241
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This school is in danger

242
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And she needs that stone to save the school

243
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If not, many lives will be in danger

244
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This is so annoying

245
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Alva doesn't need that stone

246
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is she doing?

247
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't know

248
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Alva is in danger

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What are you doing?

250
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What are you doing in there?

251
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Alva

252
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
How is it, Alva?

253
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes, Ma'am. I got the stone

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Excuse me

255
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What are you doing in there?

256
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What are you doing in there?

257
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Help!

258
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Help!

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Help!

260
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Alva fainted!

261
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Sir!

262
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Sir!

263
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
For the next two hours, your voice will change into the voice of an animal

264
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
To be continued...

265
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Goodbye, Ma'am

266
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What do you mean, Alva?

267
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I managed to get the stone

268
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And I gave it to the professor

269
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I never told you to do that

270
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Alva, why did you take that stone?

271
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Professor Agni asked me to

272
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Because this school is in danger

273
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Only that stone can save this school

274
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Alva, I never asked you to take that stone

275
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But last afternoon, Professor Agni asked me to take the Stone of Eternity

276
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
No, Alva. I never asked you to take that stone

277
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Professor, the Stone of Eternity has...

278
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The Three Headed Dragon, they all fainted

279
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The Three Headed Dragon

280
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Alva, how did you know all of this?

281
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Professor Agni, Professor Agni told me

282
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And Professor Agni also told me about the food of the Three Headed Dragon

283
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Alva, I never and never asked you to do all of that

284
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes, Professor

285
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Alva, it's time for you to go back to your dorm

286
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But, Professor, I really gave the stone to Professor Agni

287
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And after that, I don't know what happened

288
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I think someone followed me until I fainted

289
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I never received anything from you, Alva

290
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's impossible, Professor. I can't be lying

291
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Listen, Alva. The stone can't save this school

292
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
On the contrary, if the stone falls on your head,

293
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
this school will be in danger

294
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
For example, the Dark Prince

295
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The Dark Prince?

296
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Who is he?

297
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You shouldn't be hearing this name

298
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And you don't need to know who he is

299
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He's the son of a witch, a thief, a thief

300
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He's the son of a witch, a thief, and a thief

301
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Enough. Now, go back to your dorm

302
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm sorry, Professor

303
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
This time, you're really naughty, Alva

304
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You went into the room, took the stone, and the stone was gone

305
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And you lied again when you were asked by Professor Agni

306
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But, Tentara, I'm not lying

307
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't believe it

308
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How can you believe it?

309
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Professor Agni has been a teacher at this school for decades, Alva

310
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So, it's impossible for him to be lying

311
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But, I'm telling the truth, Tentara. I'm not lying

312
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm not lying

313
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Tentara, who is the Dark Prince?

314
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The Dark Prince?

315
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not time for you to know, Alva

316
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Clearly, the Dark Prince is very dangerous, Alva

317
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Not a single person expects him to come back

318
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Rey, you've recovered

319
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Rey, I know everything

320
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You took the Stone of Kabadian

321
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And you lied

322
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You said Professor Agni asked you to do it

323
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But, you didn't

324
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Now, you're denying it

325
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Is it true or not?

326
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No, Rey. It's a lie

327
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I gave the Stone of Kabadian to Professor Agni

328
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And suddenly, someone took it from me

329
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And I don't know what happened

330
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Someone took it from me

331
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I don't know what happened

332
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Really? But, I don't believe it

333
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Vega, you don't believe me either

334
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Alright, if you don't believe me, it's okay

335
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll prove it to you later

336
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
If what I said is true

337
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
He's the one who's angry

338
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I should be the one who's angry

339
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I defended him until he got poisoned

340
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But, he's just a victim of the PHP

341
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't think he's wrong, Rey

342
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
What do you mean? Professor Agni lied?

343
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
He's a liar

344
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Hey, guys

345
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You've heard that Alva is a thief

346
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
She stole the Stone of Kabadian

347
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
She stole the Stone of Kabadian

348
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
How can a thief be allowed to enter this school?

349
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It turns out that Klepto doesn't know shame

350
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
He's already a thief, but he still dares to show up here

351
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Hey, guys

352
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's not fun if there's a thief in our school

353
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I have an idea

354
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We have to make a petition, guys

355
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What do you think? Do you agree?

356
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Agree

357
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Petition? No way

358
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
By the time, they are taken to the school

359
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's very unlikely that they can find Bung Sapiens

360
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But, maybe we can find your plan

361
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Let's be smart, guys

362
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You disappointed the parents

363
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Dear God, it's our chance

364
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We shouldn't be careless

365
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Wow, there are a lot of signs

366
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
If this continues, Malik will be expelled from this school

367
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Do you know, guys?

368
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Dasar Malik, Dasar Malik, Dasar Malik

369
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Kava, let's go

370
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Rai, what are you doing?

371
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Come here

372
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Rai, what are you doing?

373
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You are the reason why Alva got expelled

374
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Alva betrayed us

375
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Rai, Alva is a good person

376
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
He saved me from the bad guys

377
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
A good person like Alva can't do that

378
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm sure that he is trapped now

379
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Come on, a rat can't be trapped

380
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Alva, listen to me

381
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't want to be poisoned

382
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If you want to help Alva, go there

383
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I want to sleep

384
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Rai!

385
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Alva said that she was trapped in front of the forbidden room

386
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I think I need to investigate that room

387
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Maybe there are some evidence left there

388
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Alva!

389
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Alva, what's wrong?

390
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What's wrong?

391
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Ouch, it hurts

392
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What's wrong?

393
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Hey, don't go there!

394
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Why is this room sealed now?

395
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It wasn't like this before

396
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yes, because Alva entered this room yesterday

397
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And this is a very forbidden room

398
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's why this room is sealed with a spell

399
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So that no one can enter

400
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And you, don't go there

401
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't want to see you

402
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't want to see you

403
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't want to see you

404
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And you, don't ever try to enter this room

405
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Do you understand?

406
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll go now

407
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
If you don't use the spell,

408
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm sure you can open it with a spell

409
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I have to find a spell to open this seal

410
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Alva!

411
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Now no one believes me

412
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Tentara, Rey, and Vega

413
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
They think I'm lying

414
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But I don't have any evidence

415
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And I don't know where the bodyguards are

416
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Hi, bro

417
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Why are you smiling?

418
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Do you believe me?

419
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes

420
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Here, a candy from me

421
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Take it

422
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
One for you, one for me

423
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Thank you

424
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You're welcome

425
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Let's open it

426
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Is it good?

427
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's not good

428
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's good

429
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's good

430
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Why is your voice like this?

431
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's so funny

432
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What I gave you is a voice changer

433
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So for the next two hours,

434
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
your voice will change into an animal's voice

435
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That's a lesson, who's that?

436
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're expelled from school

437
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We're expelled

438
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
We're expelled

439
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Don't ever say a spell in front of a mirror

440
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Because the spell will come back to you

441
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
For that, there's a spell you can use

442
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You have to say this spell

443
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Before you say the spell you want to say

444
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Repeat after me

445
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Javangan Panto

446
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Javangan Panto

447
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Javangan Panto

448
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Javangan Panto

449
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
One more time

450
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Javangan Panto

451
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Javangan Panto

452
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Alva

453
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Why don't you repeat the spell?

454
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Do you think you're smart enough?

455
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Why are you so quiet, Alva?

456
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Come on, repeat the spell

457
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Javangan Panto

458
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Javangan Panto

459
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Javangan Panto

460
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You rejected me, Alva

461
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Javangan Panto

462
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Javangan Panto

463
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Shut up!

464
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You've gone too far, Alva

465
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
For that, I will punish you

466
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Javangan Panto

467
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm sorry

468
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Attention, everyone

469
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
All teachers gather in the classroom

470
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Attention, everyone

471
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
All teachers gather in the classroom

472
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Javangan Panto

473
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Javangan Panto

474
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Javangan Panto

475
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Javangan Panto

476
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Javangan Panto

477
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Javangan Panto

478
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Javangan Panto

479
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
What is it that needs to be discussed?

480
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Until I have to leave my class

481
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
What steps should we take against Alva?

482
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I don't think it needs to be discussed

483
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Alva must be expelled

484
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Javangan Panto

485
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Javangan Panto

486
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Javangan Panto

487
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Javangan Panto

488
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Javangan Panto

489
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Expelling a student from school

490
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Can't be done easily

491
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But, Professor

492
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
What Alva has done

493
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Is out of bounds

494
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
If we don't expel her

495
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We will be protested by the parents

496
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's too soon

497
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The full moon is in three days

498
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And if in the full moon

499
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The Dark Lord gets the Stone of Eternity

500
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
He will get an unlimited power

501
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That will destroy this world

502
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And all of that will happen because of Alva

503
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Professor

504
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
During the break

505
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Some of the students

506
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Gave me this petition

507
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The petition states

508
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That all the students in this school

509
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Agree to expel Alva from this school

510
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It seems

511
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We have no other choice, Professor

512
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Alva must be expelled from this school

513
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Alva must be expelled from this school

514
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Megantara

515
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Call Alva

516
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Tell her to come here

517
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Luckily my voice is back

518
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
If not

519
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Professor Aldebaran will be mad

520
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Megantara

521
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Why did you call me?

522
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Good morning, Professor

523
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The words you will hear

524
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Won't be pleasant to the ears

525
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But you have to listen

526
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Why, Professor?

527
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You are expelled from this school

528
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Now

529
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Get your things ready

530
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Tomorrow morning the school guard will bring you to the dance

531
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm done talking

532
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You can go now

533
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Goodbye, Professor

534
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Goodbye

535
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Professor

536
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Rolf

537
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Did Alva

538
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Really take the stone?

539
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No

540
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The child didn't do anything wrong

541
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
If it wasn't Alva

542
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Does it mean Professor Aldebaran

543
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
No

544
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Agni is not lying

545
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Something happened

546
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And we have to find out

547
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
What really happened

548
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Rey

549
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Professor Aldebaran just called me

550
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You don't want to know

551
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I got a punishment from Professor Aldebaran

552
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's all my fault

553
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I lied

554
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Rey

555
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Rey, come here

556
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Help me

557
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
To find the mantra to open the seal

558
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Okay

559
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Do you want to read?

560
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
No, I'm fine

561
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I came here for a refreshing

562
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Not to read a book

563
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You don't want to know, you have to help me

564
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Dufuduk

565
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I want to read a book

566
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The last mantra

567
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The last mantra

568
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Reyka

569
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Stop it

570
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm so sleepy

571
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Let go of the mantra

572
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You can sleep later

573
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But after I read the mantra

574
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm so tired

575
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yay, I got the mantra

576
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yay, I can sleep

577
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yay, I got the mantra

578
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Amen

579
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I just remembered

580
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The ring

581
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The ring of the moon

582
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But it's useless

583
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
You were taken out

584
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
What's wrong?

585
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The ring of the moon

586
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The ring of the moon

587
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yes, I did it

588
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Why did you go there?

589
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Because I'm scared

590
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
There was a kid who was bewitched

591
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And fainted here

592
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Don't attack Alva

593
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Oh my god, my head

594
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Don't ask anything to my mother

595
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I don't want to tell you anything

596
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Understand?

597
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But you have to tell me, who attacked Alva?

598
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
At first, there was Professor Agni

599
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Professor Agni?

600
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Then, this place was so smoky

601
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So, I didn't see who attacked the kid

602
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But he attacked with magic

603
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
He must have a great power

604
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I want to go to the other farm

605
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's scary here

606
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
At least, now I know

607
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Alva is not wrong

608
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Where are you going?

609
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Wait, wait

610
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Where's Alva?

611
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Have you seen Alva?

612
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Alva?

613
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Alva was taken out of the school

614
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
What?

615
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes

616
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Now, she's at home

617
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
What?

618
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
She can sleep here?

619
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes, why?

620
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Ri, Ri, wake up

621
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Ri, Ri, Ri

622
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Alva, Ri, Ri

623
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Alva was taken out of the school

624
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Ri, come on

625
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Alva was taken out

626
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Come on, let's ask the teacher

627
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Come on, hurry up

628
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yes

629
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The news you heard is true

630
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Now, Alva is being taken to the lake by the school principal

631
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's my fault

632
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I was mean to Alva

633
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
She wanted to tell me about the punishment

634
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I didn't want to listen

635
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
You're too much

636
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
You're so insensitive

637
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Everyone says that

638
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Even though she's pretty, she's not sensitive

639
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Why?

640
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But, Tentara

641
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Alva is not wrong

642
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
We have to make her go back to this school

643
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But, we don't have any proof

644
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You're talking nonsense

645
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
There can't be any proof

646
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But, we have to investigate this together

647
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Besides, Alva is Tentara's friend

648
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
How can Tentara see her own friend who's not wrong

649
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But, she's being punished

650
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Alva, get on this boat

651
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
This boat will take you back

652
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Alva, get on this boat

653
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Let's go back

654
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
All three of you

655
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
All three of you

656
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I will make sure that you won't see Vega again

657
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But, if you don't

658
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I don't care

659
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They hate me

660
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
What's that?

661
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
What's that?

662
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
You've been expelled from this school

663
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Why are you still here?

664
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Sabine's ring

665
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Do you know who stole the stone?

666
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Who?

667
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Professor Tuluak

668
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I will prove that I'm right

669
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Just wait and see

670
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Run!

671
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Don't let Abadian's stone

672
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Be given to the next generation

673
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
There are two Professor Tuluak

674
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Hey, hey, hey

675
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Hey, hey, hey

676
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Show your spirit, get ready

677
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Buddy, buddy, buddy

678
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Run, jump, climb

679
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Star, star, star

680
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Be brave, don't give up

681
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Chase your dreams

682
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Go, go, go

683
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Achieve all your dreams

684
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Go, go, go

685
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Never stop

686
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Go, go, go

687
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Fight with your heart

688
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Go, go, go

689
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Be proud of yourself

690
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Go, go, go

691
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Let's dream

692
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Go, go, go

693
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
We are sure
