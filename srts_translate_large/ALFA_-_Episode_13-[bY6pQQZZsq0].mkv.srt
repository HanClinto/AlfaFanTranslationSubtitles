00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go! Go! Go!

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Make yourself proud!

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go! Go! Go!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's dream!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Go! Go! Go!

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We will never stop until we get that fire!

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So that we can all be one.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, they are one.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We can't let this happen.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I have to stop them.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't touch me!

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ouch!

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ouch!

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Brita, you're so brave.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You know what?

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're just a bad person who dares to attack his own friend.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm a bad person?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's not a bad person.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He just can't control himself.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm glad I can help you.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But you have to remember.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can't use your feelings.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You have to control yourself.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You have to think for yourself.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And you have to let go of your love for others.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let me go!

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Help!

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Shut up!

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's useless to call them.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They won't get you.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Finally, they called me.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm so lucky.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where am I?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm so lucky.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Help!

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Help!

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Help!

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Help!

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Help!

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Help!

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Help!

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Brita!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where are you?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Brita!

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm here!

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What should I do?

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't help you like this.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm over there!

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Brita!

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Brita!

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Help!

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've learned Pegasus' spell.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is good.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me try.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Pegasus!

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She's so small.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How can she help me?

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tell me!

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Bulgarda.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want Bulgarda.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Bulgarda.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Pegasus!

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She's so small.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Bulgarda.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let go of my rope.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you, Bulgarda.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Vivi Lang.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Brita!

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Rai!

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait!

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Where are you?

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Brita!

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Rai!

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Brita!

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Where are you?

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Rai!

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Wait!

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Brita!

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where are you?

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Rai!

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Rika!

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Alva, I'm here!

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Rai!

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where are you?

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Alva, I'm here!

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me go!

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Rai!

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let go of the rope!

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Rai, are you okay?

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You look for Pegasus.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll look for Brita.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let me go!

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Help!

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Help!

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Help me, Heran!

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Brita.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You must gather your strength and attack them.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now, you throw the people who seduced you.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now!

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Brita!

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Brita!

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brita, where are you?

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brita!

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where is Brita?

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
When I got here, Brita was gone.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Where is she?

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Brita!

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Rai, use your hairpin.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Guys, we are being chased by that guy.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Stop!

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Brita, let's go back to school.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, let's go back to school.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't follow him anymore.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He is evil.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go back to school.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't follow him anymore.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't be fooled, Brita.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you remember?

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They have made you sad.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They have disappointed you.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Brita, let's go.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go back to school.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We are going to play house snakes again.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's go, Brita.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's go, Brita.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's go.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Venga!

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are you okay?

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Venga.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Brita.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Venga.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't push yourself too much.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's better for you to take a rest.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay?

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Brita is so brave.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She made Venga become like this.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I told you.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She is a monster.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's why we shouldn't get close to her anymore.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I feel sorry for Venga.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I shouldn't have gone.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry, Kameran.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You don't have to feel sorry.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Make this a learning experience for you.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You have to remember.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I will never leave you in any condition.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And...

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is your place.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I will always be by your side.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's true.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Kelita has a very dangerous power.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And we have to be careful to catch her.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We have to prepare more to fight that child.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If we can tame her,

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
all this snow will melt.

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Tri.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You have to make a new weapon.

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tri.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You have to make a new weapon.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A great weapon.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A weapon that can defeat the child named Kelita.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright.

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We will take revenge on them.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Kelita.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Kelita, let's go home.

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Kelita, let's go home.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's go back to school.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's play together again.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I feel sorry for Vega.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come on, Kelita.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She must be very sad.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
She must be thinking about Kelita.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Kelita, let's go home.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Kelita, let's go home.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Come on, Kelita.

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Kelita.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Kelita, let's go home.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Wait.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Wake up, Kelita.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Wake up.

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What's wrong with you?

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Are you sick?

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm not sick.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I feel sorry for Vega.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Kelita, let's go home.

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's go home and play together again.

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Kelita, let's go home.

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Tentara, we have to help Vega.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We have to take Vega to Kelita's place.

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Tentara, do you feel sorry for her?

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Ava, don't worry.

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That place is very far away.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We will find a way.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't worry.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That place is very far away.

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Not only far away,

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that place is very dangerous.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's why, Tentara.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I ask you to help me, Tentara.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
To make me safe.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Can you, Tentara?

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Please, Tentara.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I feel sorry for Vega.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Please, I beg you.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes, Ava.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We have to go there.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What are we going to wear?

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How about this?

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you think?

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a good idea, isn't it?

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Buy a card.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's filled with coconut.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's a good idea.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's Ava's idea.

224
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's go.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Wafamun Naga Kepala Tiga.

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Naga Kepala Tiga.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I brought your favorite food.

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Please, enjoy.

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Change.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's go.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Finish it.

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Finish it.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hold it tight.

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hold it tight.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hold it tight.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hold it.

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Hold it tight.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hold it tight.

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We will succeed.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This arrow is very powerful.

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Whatever it hits...

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
...will turn into ice.

246
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Good.

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So, what should I do now?

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We have to hold on.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Until I can control that kid.

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hi, kid.

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He's the one who kidnapped me.

253
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why does he know you?

254
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Besides...

255
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
...you don't have to worry.

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Because I've made Aldebaran...

257
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
...and the other teachers...

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
...fight back with the Elf warriors.

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So, they won't disturb our plan now.

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Good, Angkara.

261
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Now, your job is to get rid of Ray and Vega.

262
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I will make the people destroy Alva.

263
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You have to kidnap Alva.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay.

265
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Soon.

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Soon, Alva will be mine.

267
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What are you doing?

268
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What are you doing?

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Stay there.

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're a bad person.

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I won't let you hurt Vega.

272
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Pelita.

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Don't run.

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Pelita.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Don't run.

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Pelita.

277
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't run.

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Pelita.

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Where are you going?

280
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's late.

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You should sleep.

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll teach you a new knowledge tomorrow.

283
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't want to.

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I know everything.

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're a bad person.

286
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You're friends with the people who kidnapped me.

287
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You want to harm Vega and Alva, right?

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't want to follow you.

289
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Good.

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Come here.

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How dare you.

292
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll kill you.

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll kill you.

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Pelita.

295
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Pelita.

296
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Let's go.

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Thank you, Naga.

298
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Thank you, Naga.

299
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think the place is close.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Thank you, Naga.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Thank you, Naga.

302
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I think the place is close.

303
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Naga.

304
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Pelita.

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Naga.

306
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Naga.

307
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Wake up, Vega.

308
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Vega, wake up.

309
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wake up.

310
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Vega, wake up.

311
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Wake up, Vega.

312
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Wake up.

313
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Wake up, Vega.

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Keep going, Naga.

315
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Finish them.

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Wake up, Vega.

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Wake up.

318
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Vega, wake up.

319
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Vega.

320
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Wake up.

321
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Wake up, Vega.

322
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Wake up, Vega.

323
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Wake up, Vega.

324
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes, five.

325
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
One, two, three, four, five.

326
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah.

327
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Wake up, Vega.

328
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Vega.

329
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Wake up.

330
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Wake up, Vega.

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Wake up, Vega.

332
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Wake up, Vega.

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Wake up, Vega.

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Wake up, Vega.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Go, go, go.

336
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Vega.

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Go, go, go.

338
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You're alive.

339
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Vega, you're safe.

340
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Vega.

341
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Make yourself proud.

342
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Go, go, go.

343
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Let's dream.

344
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Go, go, go.

345
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
We can do it.

346
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm glad you're not frozen.

347
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm so happy.

348
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm so proud of you.

349
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm not frozen because of you.

350
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Because I love you.

351
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That's why I'm not frozen.

352
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Felita.

353
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
From now on, fill your heart...

354
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
...with love.

355
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay?

356
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And don't hate anyone.

357
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay?

358
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
One more thing.

359
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't be afraid to be left behind.

360
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We'll always be with you.

361
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Okay?

362
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay.

363
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Go, go, go.

364
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
We can do it.

365
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Everyone, wait for me here.

366
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I want to show you something.

367
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Go, go, go.

368
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Let's dream.

369
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Go, go, go.

370
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Go, go, go.

371
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't laugh.

372
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
We can do it.

373
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
We can do it.

374
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Where's Popo?

375
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Where's Popo?

376
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Popo.

377
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Where are you?

378
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Popo.

379
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Popo.

380
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Popo.

381
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Where are you, Popo?

382
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Gawat.

383
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
That's our target.

384
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Break up.

385
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Break up.

386
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Look.

387
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The ice is melting.

388
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Everything is back to normal.

389
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This means...

390
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
...the firecrackers...

391
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
...will come back to us.

392
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Don't laugh.

393
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The firecrackers are back.

394
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes.

395
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So, Vega succeeded...

396
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
...in making Blita realize the meaning of love and sacrifice.

397
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And finally, all this mess ended.

398
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That's right, Professor.

399
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And you, Megantara.

400
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Why did you let Alva and Vega...

401
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
...escape from school...

402
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
...and bring the headmaster...

403
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
...without reporting to me?

404
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Eating fish...

405
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
...shared with coconuts.

406
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Again.

408
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I forgot.

409
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I failed again.

410
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I thought I could get Blita to be my weapon.

411
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So, I don't have to face Aldebaran directly.

412
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Anggara.

413
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes, sir.

414
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Do you know what you have to do?

415
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes, sir.

416
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Tomorrow night, the Fallen Star will appear.

417
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I will get it and give it to you...

418
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
...so you can get the power from the Fallen Star.

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
No.

420
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You have to get it, Anggara.

421
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Don't fail.

422
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yes, sir.

423
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The Fallen Star.

424
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The Fallen Star is...

425
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
...a space star...

426
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
...that fell to the earth.

427
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And when it fell to the earth...

428
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
...the star turned into a beautiful woman.

429
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Then...

430
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Tommy.

431
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes, sir.

432
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
When was the last time the star fell?

433
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't know.

434
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Tommy.

435
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Tommy.

436
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Tommy.

437
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
When was the last time the star fell?

438
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I don't know, sir.

439
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't know, sir.

440
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Pay attention.

441
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Vega knows when was the last time the star fell.

442
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The star fell...

443
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
...about a thousand years ago.

444
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Good.

445
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's right.

446
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Thank you, sir.

447
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Then...

448
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The question is...

449
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
...why did the Fallen Star...

450
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
...get a lot of attention from the people?

451
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Ray.

452
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Why did the Fallen Star...

453
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
...get a lot of attention from the people?

454
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Maybe because...

455
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Maybe because...

456
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Why?

457
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because...

458
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because it's beautiful.

459
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Vega.

460
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Why did the people get a lot of attention from the people?

461
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Because the Fallen Star gives power.

462
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There's no limit...

463
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
...for those who catch it.

464
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Especially for the heart.

465
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That's right.

466
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
A round of applause for Vega.

467
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Why did the Fallen Star get a lot of attention from the people?

468
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Because the Fallen Star will be fought...

469
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
...by people who are thirsty for power.

470
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's why...

471
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
...Professor Aldebaran insisted...

472
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
...that all of us...

473
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
...are forbidden to catch the Fallen Star.

474
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Thank you, Aldebaran.

475
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
There's a party.

476
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Party.

477
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I like parties.

478
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Popo.

479
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What?

480
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Don't touch me.

481
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Don't touch me.

482
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'll turn into ice.

483
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm afraid of the cold.

484
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Don't be afraid, Popo.

485
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I can handle my power.

486
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I made you freeze.

488
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's true.

489
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You're crazy.

490
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Crazy? What am I?

491
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Popo.

492
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Let's go home.

493
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
What?

494
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Home?

495
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's great.

496
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm free.

497
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not helping anyone.

498
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's all because of Alva.

499
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't want to get hurt.

500
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We're sorry.

501
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We want to hurt you.

502
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's okay.

503
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Okay.

504
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Excuse us.

505
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Let's go home.

506
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Kids.

507
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Let's gather.

508
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
There's a firework party.

509
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What?

510
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What?

511
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What?

512
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
What?

513
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
What?

514
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What?

515
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's not a firework.

516
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You better give up.

517
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Before the 8th of Pangeran comes.

518
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That's not a firework.

519
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's not a firework.

520
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That's not a firework.

521
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's not a firework.

522
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Don't do that.

523
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's not a firework.

524
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Don't do that.

525
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Rai will be happy.

526
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He will be happy.

527
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'll tell her myself.

528
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Actually, I've never been happy with a girl.

529
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That's not a firework.

530
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
This is very rare.

531
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We have to get the falling star.

532
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Let's go.

533
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What's that?

534
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I don't know.

535
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's the falling star.

536
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I can't fail this time.

537
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Hey!

538
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Hey!

539
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Get out!

540
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Get out!

541
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Get out!

542
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You better give up.

543
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Before the 8th prince comes here,

544
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
we won't let him go.

545
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Before we get his heart.

546
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Don't dream.

547
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Everyone wants his heart.

548
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But it's not that easy.

549
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Step on my body first.

550
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Step on my body first.

551
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Step on my body first.

552
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Step on my body first.

553
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Step on my body first.

554
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's so heavy.

555
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Let me rest for a while.

556
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's heavy.

557
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Are you going to take my heart?

558
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Right?

559
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
No.

560
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Not me.

561
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You're a bad person.

562
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
We can do this.

563
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
We can do this.

564
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Help me.

565
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Okay.

566
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'll help you.

567
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'll make you sleep forever.

568
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Devil!

569
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Devil!

570
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You're so rude.

571
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It turns out you can use my magic.

572
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But I won't lose.

573
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Devil!

574
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Hey!

575
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Hey!

576
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Thank you for helping me.

577
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm sorry. I misjudged you.

578
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And I hit you too.

579
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yes. When you landed, they were fighting for your battle.

580
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So I took you away from there.

581
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm so sorry.

582
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I feel bad.

583
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You want to forgive me, right?

584
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yes.

585
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
DEVIL!

586
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Where's the devil?

587
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
The devil is gone.

588
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's all your fault.

589
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You have to accept the consequences.

590
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
DEVIL!

591
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Listen!

592
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The devil is mine.

593
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
If you meet him, you can't touch him.

594
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You can't even see him.

595
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Do you understand?

596
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Good.

597
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Goodbye.

598
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
DEVIL!

599
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I think this belongs to Sido's school.

600
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm sure they took Putri Bintangjatu.

601
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's them.

602
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Let's go there.

603
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
My name is Selena.

604
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Alva.

605
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm from Sigir's school.

606
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Alva.

607
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I beg you.

608
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Don't tell anyone that I'm Bintangjatu.

609
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Because they will fight for me.

610
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
My hair will be cut.

611
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Because my hair can make any kind of clothes.

612
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And my tears will be squeezed.

613
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Because my tears can create new power.

614
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And can cure any kind of disease.

615
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And my heart.

616
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
If my heart is taken and eaten.

617
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It can create unlimited power.

618
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It's their fault for fighting to get you.

619
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm scared, Alva.

620
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I want to go back to heaven.

621
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Okay.

622
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Don't be sad.

623
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I promise I won't tell anyone about you.

624
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And I will help you to go back to heaven.

625
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Are you serious?

626
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yes.

627
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You're so kind.

628
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Thank you, Alva.

629
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Promise?

630
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Don't go anywhere.

631
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Because this place is safe.

632
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I want to go back to the festival.

633
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Because they are looking for me.

634
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
If you don't tell us where Putri Bintangjatu is.

635
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
We will find her ourselves.

636
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Salam Lestari!

637
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Ali Baran!

638
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
What are you doing here?

639
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Are you a warrior?

640
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Or are you a bandit?

641
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
What's the truth?

642
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Where did you hide Putri Bintangjatu?

643
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Give her back to us.

644
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Because she belongs to us.

645
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Putri Bintangjatu.

646
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I don't understand.

647
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Stop pretending.

648
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
This is the proof.

649
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
We found this brooch at Putri Bintangjatu's place.

650
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Calm down.

651
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.

652
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The proof is with us.

653
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And that's not wrong.

654
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
If you don't tell us where Putri Bintangjatu is.

655
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
We will find her ourselves.

656
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Wait.

657
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I won't let you in.

658
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Without my permission.

659
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
You have to face me.

660
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Putri Bintangjatu.

661
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Okay, let's go.

662
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The base of the kidnappers.

663
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
They really did it.

664
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Just a little bit.

665
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And they're gone.

666
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Professor Ali Baran.

667
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
What about this?

668
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
This is a very serious problem.

669
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I will find out about Putri Bintangjatu.

670
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You stay here.

671
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I will find the answer.

672
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Agni.

673
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Take the kids inside.

674
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Come in.

675
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Alva, where are you from?

676
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yes, Alva, where are you from?

677
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We're looking for you.

678
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I can't tell them that I'm Putri Bintangjatu.

679
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I made a promise.

680
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I have a stomachache.

681
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
That's why I've been in the toilet.

682
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Alva has a stomachache.

683
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I'll take the medicine in the clinic.

684
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
No need.

685
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm fine now.

686
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Let's go there.

687
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The teachers will hear us.

688
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Let's go.

689
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It's been a long time.

690
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
What is he doing?

691
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
He's singing.

692
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
To be continued...

693
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
To be continued...

694
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
To be continued...

695
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
To be continued...

696
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
To be continued...

697
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
To be continued...

698
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Alva.

699
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Selima.

700
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It's so crowded here.

701
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What are you doing here?

702
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Do you want to sing and dance?

703
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Come here.

704
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
No.

705
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't want to.

706
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't want to sing and dance.

707
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
What are you doing here?

708
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I want you to be quiet.

709
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Why?

710
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Because if you sing and dance...

711
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Your voice will be heard in my dorm.

712
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
People will be suspicious.

713
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What should I do?

714
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Just sleep.

715
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It's late.

716
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Alva, I'm Bintang.

717
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Bintang's job is to keep me awake at night.

718
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So, I can't sleep at night.

719
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
But, you can't be noisy.

720
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
If you're caught, and...

721
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
You'll be arrested.

722
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
What will you do?

723
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You'll be arrested.

724
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
That's why...

725
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You can't be noisy.

726
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I'll go now.

727
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Bye.

728
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Idiot.

729
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You can't do that.

730
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm sorry, sir.

731
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's all because of you.

732
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I don't want to hear your excuses.

733
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Why did you let him go?

734
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I have to find Bintang.

735
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Help!

736
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Help!

737
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Wow.

738
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It's huge.

739
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You're great, sir.

740
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Cool.

741
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
How can it be in someone's house?

742
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
This is weird.

743
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
To be continued...

744
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
To be continued...
