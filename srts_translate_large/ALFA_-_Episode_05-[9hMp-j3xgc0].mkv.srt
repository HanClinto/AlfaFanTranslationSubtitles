1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The power of the heart

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Make yourself proud

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go, go, go

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's dream

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go, go, go

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can do it

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why was he accepted at a magic school?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Three days until the full moon

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And what if in the full moon

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The dark lord gets his stone

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He will get unlimited power

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And will destroy this world

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will prove that I'm right

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just wait and see

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I will not let anyone disturb my mission

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
To take the stone to eternity

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And from now on

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The school has decided

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If Alva is not expelled from the school

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Congratulations

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's eat together

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's eat

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's eat together

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't sleep

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's hot

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why are you shaking?

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I got a pimple

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If it's a pimple, it's a pimple

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm scared

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
My food will be eaten by Kharizan

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, it's a pimple

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Really?

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, there will be a pimple there

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hurry up

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The toilet is down there

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The toilet is still far away

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There's a lake

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I will go to the lake

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I will go to the lake

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want to meet the guards

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to meet the guards

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Alvaro!

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Alvaro!

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me go!

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Alvaro!

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You will regret it

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Because you have caught me

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And don't you think

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The Dark Lord won't wake up

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Because you have caught me

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Terror won't end here

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And in the end

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You will lose

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This school

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Will collapse

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let me go!

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Watch him

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, sir

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me go!

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't let the students hear his scream

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes, sir

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let me go!

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Alvaro!

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me go!

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Students

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now I will teach you

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How to destroy the enemy's weapons

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Pay close attention

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Weapon blast

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now it's time for you to practice

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Try Ray and...

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Tole?

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Where's Tole?

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I haven't seen Tole since yesterday

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know where Tole is

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What should we do?

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Professor Adni

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry, I have to interrupt

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Students

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've told you a thousand times

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Gorilla is a coward

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Dream of a giraffe

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you want to be a child, don't be a coward

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Throw the leftovers in the trash

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who did this?

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Huh?

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Pee

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Who did this?

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hey, Alva

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't tell me that's Metal Chicken

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's right

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now he's a chicken

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Because he's afraid of being eaten

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Megantara

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Where did you get that chicken from?

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Near the lake

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He swallowed it

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And then he ate it with Boya

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Here, Karim

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is a gift for your birthday

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why is it only for flowers?

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you, Nick

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're welcome, Karim

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Nick, Nick

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why did you do that to Boya?

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm so sorry

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Come back

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You pig

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Seriously

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's not right

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not right

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Are you strong enough?

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is it in your head?

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're too frail

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Evro

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm your good kid

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't you have feet?

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't be an ouch boy

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It hurt

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It hurt

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Understood

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Finally

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Take the ball

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and throw it

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, sir

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Come on, Danang

226
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Follow me

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have to go back to Danang

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Who knows

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If I can save Tole

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can be a champion like Alva

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hey, don't run

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Come back to me

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't give up, Sarin

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Run, Sarin

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't come close, Sarin

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't come close

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,300
Come back to me

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And this is our savior this time, Rey

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Who saved Tole and Karin from the attack of...

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And this is our savior this time, Rey

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Who saved Tole and Karin from the attack of...

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And this is our savior this time, Rey

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Rey, hold this

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Where's Rey?

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Where is she?

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's Rey

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why is she there?

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
She's not far

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Wait, wait

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Something's not right

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Rey doesn't look like this

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's follow her

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Maybe she has something on her mind

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go

255
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't be afraid

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because I'm going to be the champion

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But...

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know what the enemy looks like

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What if the dog is fierce?

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What if I get bitten?

261
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What if the dog is fierce?

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are you guys doing here?

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're going to the lake

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We're going to beat up the guy who kidnapped your friend

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Tolek

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's your good friend

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Good friend?

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm sorry

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We're not good friends

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We just want to be heroes

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We don't care about your friend's fate

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're just like me

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I want to be a hero too

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What if we go there together?

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's go

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Where is he?

277
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Maybe he's in the lake

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We have to find him

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let's go

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Where are you guys going?

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
All students are ordered to stay in their respective dormitories

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Where are you guys going?

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Come back or I'll give you a punishment

285
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What are you guys doing in the lake?

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We're going to beat up the guy who kidnapped your friend

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Tolek

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He's your good friend

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We're not good friends

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We just want to be heroes

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We don't care about your friend's fate

293
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're just like me

294
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We have to find him

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Where are you guys going?

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We're going to beat up the guy who kidnapped your friend

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Karim?

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He's my friend

300
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He's my friend

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Karim?

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Wake up

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Wake up

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Where am I?

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't know either

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sure we're being escaped by Duyung

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Mom, Dad

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm scared

309
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Tolek

310
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where are you going?

311
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry, I got scared

312
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's so scary

313
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We don't have anyone left

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We're all alone

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Wake up

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If Duyung doesn't show up

317
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's go fishing

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Then we'll catch him

319
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What do we do if Duyung doesn't show up?

320
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes

321
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Someone has to swim to catch him

322
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Please, Tolek

323
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't swim

324
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You know I can't swim

325
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Don't tempt me

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't feel good

327
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yes, Tom

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I can't

329
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't try it

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is it

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If you want to lose, you have to swim to the middle

332
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I can't swim

333
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Hurry up, Dandrink

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll go with you

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If something happens to me

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
My mom will be mad

337
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you want to be expelled from this school?

338
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes, Tom

339
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's go to the middle

340
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It means one of you has to swim

341
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's go to the middle

342
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's go to the middle

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Two more

345
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It means you and Ray have to swim

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who will lose?

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Me

348
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Me

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Me

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Me

351
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Me

352
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Me

353
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Me

354
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Me

355
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Me

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Me

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Who will lose?

358
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You have to swim to the middle

359
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes, I don't want to

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You have to

361
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Jacky can't swim

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He's already wet

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't try it

364
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hurry up, Dandrink

365
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You have to go to the middle

366
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You have to swim to the middle

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You want to be expelled, don't you?

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hurry up

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hurry up, Ray

370
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Hurry up, Ray

371
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hurry up

372
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Don't go too far

373
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Go to the middle, Ray

374
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hurry up, Ray

375
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hurry up, Ray

376
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hurry up, Ray

377
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hurry up, Ray

378
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Help me, guys

379
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Attack

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Help

381
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Help

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Help

383
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Help

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Help me

385
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Help

386
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you think

387
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's easy to defeat Duyung?

388
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Do you think you're great?

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because of your actions

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Some students have to be treated in the treatment clinic

391
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If there's a serious problem

392
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This school can be closed

393
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What do you want?

394
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No, sir

395
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Now

396
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You all go back to the dormitory

397
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And no one is allowed to leave the school

398
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Without any reason

399
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And without exception

400
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Understand?

401
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Understand, ma'am

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
All of you, I will punish you

403
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
To clean the school toilet

404
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Without magic

405
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you doing?

406
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Have you changed your mind?

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Now I want to talk to Professor Alubaran

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'll go with you, professor

409
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's go

410
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sure

411
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Duyung is just a prisoner

412
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It seems like there's a bigger power

413
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Controlling them

414
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I agree

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Duyung is a good person

416
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Good

417
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They kidnapped the students

418
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And hurt the students

419
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's right, professor

420
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Nine of them are injured

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And three of them are missing

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And if the parents find out

423
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This school can be closed

424
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
In my opinion

425
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We have to take action against Duyung

426
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I disagree

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Duyung is a good person

428
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If we don't take action against Duyung

429
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There will be more victims

430
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We have to take action

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Now

432
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I agree

433
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Get the doll

434
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Change

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Duyung

436
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Professor

437
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's attack

438
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's go

439
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Attack

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Attack

441
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Help

442
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Dad, it hurts

443
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Help

444
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Dad

445
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Stop the attack

446
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
They can hurt the students

447
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Duyung

448
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Duyung

449
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Duyung

450
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Duyung

451
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Duyung

452
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Duyung

453
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Duyung

454
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Duyung

455
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Duyung

456
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Duyung

457
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We should be able to defeat Duyung

458
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But we can't do anything

459
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They kidnapped Karin, Tole and Ray

460
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I give up

461
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We have to help them

462
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They are so stubborn

463
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They don't want to listen

464
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I miss Duyung

465
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There must be a reason

466
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Soldier

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Why are you so surprised?

468
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What's wrong?

469
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Do you know Ray was kidnapped by Putri Duyung?

470
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes, I know

471
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
We want to talk to Ray

472
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Do you know what's wrong with Putri Duyung?

473
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I don't know

474
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But Putri Angsa might know

475
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Let's go

476
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What?

477
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Where are you going?

478
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
We want to find Putri Angsa

479
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Ouch

480
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Alpha, I'm going to call Angsa

481
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Hide, Angsa doesn't like men

482
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Putri Angsa

483
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
What's wrong, Angsa?

484
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What's wrong, Vega?

485
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Can we help you?

486
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Here's the thing, Angsa

487
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Duyung is attacking us

488
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And my friends are being attacked by Duyung

489
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I want to help Angsa

490
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
As far as I know, Duyung is a good person

491
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Really?

492
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But why are they attacking my friends?

493
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't know

494
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But as far as I know, Duyung doesn't like to attack people

495
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
He prefers to have sex

496
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And if they have sex, it can last for hours

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Is it true, girls?

498
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's true

499
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We got the answer, Vega

500
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Duyung doesn't like to have sex

501
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So, we have to make them have sex

502
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
There's a man

503
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Help

504
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Alpha, don't go out

505
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He doesn't like men

506
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Alpha, don't go out

507
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Alpha, don't go out

508
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Alpha, don't go out

509
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They're so fierce

510
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Let's stop playing

511
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We're almost there

512
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Let's go

513
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Let's go

514
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Jofreka!

515
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Get the mirror!

516
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Get the needle!

517
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Jofreka!

518
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Get the needle!

519
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you want to be free, answer my question first!

520
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You're our friend, why do you have to help them?

521
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's so late, Beka.

522
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We'll meet them again tomorrow.

523
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Let's go.

524
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Hey!

525
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We'll meet them again tomorrow.

526
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
If you want to be free, answer my question first.

527
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's go.

528
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What's that sound?

529
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Let's check it out, Mike.

530
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Let's go.

531
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That's Duyung!

532
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes.

533
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's go.

534
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Are you ready?

535
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes.

536
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's perfect, Mike.

537
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If we take him to the cave,

538
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
we can be hunters.

539
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yes, bro.

540
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We can be more famous than Tommy.

541
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That's right.

542
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Let's go.

543
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's so heavy, Duyung.

544
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Just stay still.

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's heavy.

546
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Where is he?

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Where is he?

548
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Why are you two being chased by the devil?

549
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's not like that, boss.

550
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We just attacked Duyung.

551
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Both of you went to the lake?

552
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
No, boss.

553
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Duyung is at the back of the school.

554
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Are you serious?

555
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yes, boss.

556
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's why it's so dangerous.

557
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We have to get out of this school.

558
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll call my dad first.

559
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay.

560
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Where are they?

561
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
There must be something.

562
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
He's bleeding.

563
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We have to help him.

564
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Why is he running away?

565
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't know.

566
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Maybe he's afraid of us.

567
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Okay, Vega.

568
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Hurry up and give him the mirror.

569
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So, he'll calm down.

570
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Okay.

571
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Hurry up.

572
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Mirror.

573
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We're late.

574
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Medicine.

575
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Here, Vega.

576
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That's rude.

577
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
They're friends with Duyung.

578
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Maybe they're the ones who planned the terror at school.

579
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I have to report this.

580
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
He's smiling.

581
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That means he's not angry anymore.

582
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yes.

583
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Maybe he knows that we're going to cure his face.

584
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I think he wants to kiss you.

585
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I think he wants to kiss you.

586
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Putri Duyung.

587
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We're friends now, right?

588
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Answer me.

589
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Where are my friends?

590
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I got it.

591
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I got it.

592
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What is this for?

593
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
To eat.

594
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
To eat.

595
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
What is this, Vega?

596
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I've read it in a book.

597
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The mirror from Duyung...

598
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
...can make the person who eats it...

599
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
...breathe underwater.

600
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Wow.

601
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's cool.

602
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Vega.

603
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It feels weird.

604
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes.

605
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But we can breathe underwater now, right?

606
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
To be continued...

607
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You're in jail.

608
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They're in the pool.

609
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Don't.

610
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You have to attack my friends.

611
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So?

612
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Where are our friends?

613
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You don't want to tell me?

614
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Where are you taking us?

615
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
To be continued...

616
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
To be continued...

617
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
To be continued...

618
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Vega.

619
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Wake up, Vega.

620
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Wake up.

621
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Vega.

622
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Vega.

623
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Duyung.

624
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Vega.

625
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Why did you buy soap?

626
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Why did you buy soap?

627
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Because of you.

628
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Because of you.

629
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Let's take Vega to the clinic.

630
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Hurry.

631
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Hold Tara.

632
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Come on.

633
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
To be continued...

634
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Dr. Pertiwi.

635
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Dr. Pertiwi.

636
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Where's Dr. Pertiwi?

637
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Dr. Pertiwi.

638
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Why are you here?

639
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I need Dr. Pertiwi.

640
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Why are you here?

641
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Dr. Pertiwi ran away.

642
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Why did he run away?

643
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Dr. Pertiwi ran away.

644
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Professor Adebaran told him to go to the village across...

645
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
...to cure people's illness.

646
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So, I'm the one who's responsible.

647
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay.

648
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay, that's enough.

649
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Now, please, Vega.

650
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He's under the spell of Professor Purwa.

651
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, no.

652
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's Purwa.

653
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I can't do that.

654
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I mean Professor Purwa.

655
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Mom.

656
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Do we need to call Purwa?

657
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Like when we cure Ray?

658
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I don't think so.

659
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I think...

660
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
...it's worse.

661
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's worse.

662
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So, what do we do?

663
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
He has to use the spell.

664
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Now, the spell is gone.

665
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
What do we do?

666
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Vega.

667
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Wait for me.

668
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'll find water for you.

669
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Duyung.

670
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I and my husband...

671
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
...don't want to hear any excuses.

672
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And now, I'm going to bring my beloved son, Tommy...

673
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
...to the village.

674
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Because I think...

675
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
...it's not safe here anymore.

676
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Right, Tommy?

677
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Right, honey?

678
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Sir.

679
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Mike and I want to go with you.

680
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Come on, sir.

681
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's go.

682
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Sure.

683
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I've prepared the boat.

684
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Duyung, you can't ask him to come.

685
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I won't stop you...

686
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
...if you want to bring your son home.

687
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And I, as the head of the school...

688
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
...apologize...

689
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
...for all the inconveniences...

690
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
...that your son and mother had.

691
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I will try to solve this problem as soon as possible.

692
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Think, guys!

693
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Tommy!

694
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Think!

695
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Vega!

696
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm sorry, sir.

697
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I didn't mean to.

698
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's okay, Alva.

700
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
How's Vega?

701
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Well, sir.

702
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I want to tell you...

703
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
...that the only way to save Vega...

704
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
...is to use Duyung's Air Mata.

705
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Duyung's Air Mata?

706
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Okay, Alva.

707
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Let's go find Duyung's Air Mata...

708
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
...so that Vega can be saved.

709
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Come on.

710
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Alva, let me call Duyung.

711
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
No, sir.

712
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Duyung will be scared.

713
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Let me do it.

714
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Putri Duyung!

715
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Where are you?

716
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Putri Duyung!

717
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I need your help!

718
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Putri Duyung!

719
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Putri Duyung!

720
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Putri Duyung.

721
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Vega is still unconscious...

722
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
...because of the ancient sorcery.

723
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
They say the sorcery is your Air Mata.

724
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Can I ask for your Air Mata for Vega?

725
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Java, hold on tight!

726
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Alva, put it here.

727
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Thank you, Putri Duyung.

728
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You're so kind.

729
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Putri Duyung!

730
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Who did that?

731
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I did it.

732
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
What do you want?

733
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's none of your business.

734
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You should go now...

735
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
...and bring your friend's Air Mata.

736
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Now!

737
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Java, you should bring the Air Mata.

738
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Poor Vega.

739
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'll make sure...

740
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
...Putri Duyung will be fine.

741
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Go now.

742
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm sorry, Putri Duyung.

743
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I have to go now.

744
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But I'll help you.

745
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Roll the dice.

746
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Putri Duyung.

747
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I've been cured, Vega!

748
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I've been cured!

749
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I was bewitched by Professor Purwa.

750
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
What happened to Duyung?

751
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
He ran away.

752
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Thank God.

753
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But he came back.

754
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Why?

755
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Because the only way to make you aware...

756
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
...is Air Mata Duyung.

757
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
He came back...

758
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
...just to help me.

759
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yes.

760
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Because he came back...

761
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
...he was caught by Professor Purwa.

762
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
We have to help him.

763
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I don't want him to get caught.

764
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Let's go.

765
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I managed to catch Duyung.

766
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And now we can interrogate him...

767
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
...to find out where the students are.

768
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Come, I'll show you.

769
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's so good.

770
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Let's go home, honey.

771
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Luckily, you came here quickly.

772
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Otherwise, we could've kidnapped Duyung.

773
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Right, Tommy?

774
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Alva and Vega will be kidnapped by Duyung soon.

775
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
What's going on?

776
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Tommy, help me!

777
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What's going on?

778
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
What's going on?

779
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Tommy, help me!

780
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Tommy!

781
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Tommy, help me!

782
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Tommy, help me!

783
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Tommy!

784
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Tommy!

785
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Tommy!

786
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Tommy, help me!

787
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Tommy, help me!

788
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Tommy, help me!

789
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Tommy!

790
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Tommy, help me!

791
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Tommy, help me!

792
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
What's going on?

793
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Mike? Jack?

794
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Tommy?

795
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Why is he here?

796
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't know.

797
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Let me go!

798
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Open the door!

799
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Open the door!

800
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Let me go!

801
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Open the door!

802
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Open the door!

803
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
He's going to be kidnapped!

804
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You're so cruel, Jack!

805
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Let me go!

806
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Let me go!

807
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let me go!

808
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Let me go!

809
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Let me go!

810
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Let me go!

811
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Two more kids.

812
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Then your task will be done.

813
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And I will return your voice.

814
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Remember.

815
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
One of those kids...

816
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
must be named Alva.

817
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Alva.

818
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Alva.

819
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Alva.

820
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Alva.

821
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Alva.

822
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Alva.

823
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Alva.

824
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Alva.

825
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Alva.

826
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That voice is so familiar.

827
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah, I feel like I know him.

828
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
But who is he?

829
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah.

830
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah.

831
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah, it's so weird.

832
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Why does that person know Alva?

833
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Who is he?

834
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Alva.

835
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You're wrong if you think I always lose.

836
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I never lose, Alva.

837
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I will never lose.

838
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Where did he go?

839
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Aldebaran.

840
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Terror will continue.

841
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Until I get the chosen one.

842
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Everyone will attack the dungeon.

843
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
We can do it.

844
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
We can do it.

845
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Now, tell me where the students are hiding.

846
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Answer me.

847
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Answer me!

848
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Answer me!

849
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Answer me!

850
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Answer me!

851
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Don't joke!

852
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I will kill you!

853
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Calm down.

854
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Come in.

855
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Get out, professor.

856
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Out!

857
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Let's go.

858
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Tommy.

859
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
My son.

860
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
He's been kidnapped.

861
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Tommy.

862
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Tommy, I'm sorry.

863
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm so sorry.

864
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
What happened?

865
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Something happened.

866
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
A huge wave.

867
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Suddenly, a paradigm appeared.

868
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It pulled Tommy and his friends to the sea.

869
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Tommy.

870
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That's why we're here.

871
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
To ask for your help.

872
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
We have to find the paradigm and destroy the castle.

873
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I agree.

874
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Let's attack the paradigm.

875
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
They're too much.

876
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I disagree.

877
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Actually, Duyung is a good person.

878
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Megantara is right.

879
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
The proof is, he wants to give his treasure to Vega.

880
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
If Duyung is a good person,

881
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
why did they kidnap the students?

882
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I agree.

883
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I will help them.

884
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
There must be something forcing them to do that.

885
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Megantara.

886
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
If you're afraid, you can stay here.

887
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But you're too slow.

888
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Everyone, get ready.

889
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Let's go.

890
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Your friends have kidnapped the students.

891
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
We won't stay still.

892
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
We will attack your castle to free the students.

893
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Do you see where Duyung is going?

894
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
To the sea.

895
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Everyone wants to attack Duyung's castle.

896
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Alva, let's go to the sea.

897
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay.

898
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Alva.

899
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Megantara.

900
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Why are the students in danger?

901
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Wait.

902
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
You're wrong.

903
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Duyung is a good person.

904
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
They're evil.

905
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Professor Purwo.

906
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Did you hear what Alva said?

907
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yes.

908
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I think we should stop this attack.

909
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Instead of doing stupid things and endangering people.

910
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
No.

911
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I have to find my students.

912
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And I have to get revenge on Duyung.

913
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because he's my enemy.

914
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Alva must have been brainwashed by Duyung.

915
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
What should we do?

916
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
We're late, Vega.

917
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Let's just follow them.

918
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Alva.

919
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Vega.

920
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
What are you doing?

921
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You can swim.

922
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You can attack.

923
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Palm trees.

924
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Turquoise trees.

925
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
You can't attack.

926
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You can only attack.

927
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But we don't have a choice.

928
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
We don't want to hurt Duyung.

929
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We'll use this method.

930
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
This is the method.

931
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Javatang.

932
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Bevebaju.

933
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Beverenang.

934
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That's cool.

935
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
By using this, we can breathe and talk inside.

936
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay.

937
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Ready.

938
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
One, two, three.

939
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That's where Duyung's palace is.

940
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Let's call them.

941
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Hi, Duyung.

942
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Come out.

943
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
We've kidnapped one of your friends.

944
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
If you don't come out and surrender...

945
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
...we'll kill you.

946
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
If you don't come out and surrender...

947
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
...we'll kill your friend.

948
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Why aren't they showing up?

949
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Calm down.

950
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
We'll wait a little longer.

951
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
They'll show up sooner or later.

952
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Be ready.

953
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Be ready.

954
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You're being used as bait.

955
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You're a bait.

956
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Alva, it's dangerous.

957
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
We don't have a choice.

958
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
No, Mama.

959
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I'm scared. We're all scared.

960
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And hungry.

961
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Karim!

962
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I'll open it.

963
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Shut up.

964
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Remember this.

965
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
If you dare to do anything...

966
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
...I'll make sure you become a fish.

967
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
To be continued...

968
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
To be continued...
