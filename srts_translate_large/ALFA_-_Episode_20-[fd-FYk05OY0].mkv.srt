1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go! Go! Go!

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Be proud of yourself!

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go! Go! Go!

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream!

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it!

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will be your shield.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will empower him.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Go!

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Tell me the truth.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Alva and Tommy,

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you have to ride your bike into the forest.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And in the forest,

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you have to catch a ghost.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
After you catch the ghost,

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you have to bring it to the finish line.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's Alva.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She made me lose my faith in life.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will make her lose.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Alva, I'll go right, you go left.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's see who will catch the ghost first.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where are the ghosts?

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't find it.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Where is it?

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's not here.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Who threw the black cloth?

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It hurts.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's you.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How are you?

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm fine.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you want to surrender yourself?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
After that, I'll catch you.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I'll bring you to the finish line.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you want to help me?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Try to catch me if you can.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, right.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You've been taught the ritual.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What are you doing, Alva?

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's all?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're so stupid.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going up.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't catch you.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're so stupid.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can't catch me.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Run.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Come on.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Alva is gone.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ghost, sit behind me.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, I'm going to win.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My father has a lifeline.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So, if you want to be caught by me, I'll give you my lifeline.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This time, I want to be caught by you.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But, I'll give you my lifeline first.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tom, is it true that I was given a lifeline?

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, you're so stupid.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Just sit down.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sure that Alva hasn't caught the ghost yet.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sure that I'll win.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
My body is aching.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Pipi!

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, yes.

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I tried to save Professor Titan.

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then, where is Professor Titan?

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm so sure.

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He must be trapped by Professor Titan.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll tell Professor Agni.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm late for Alva's competition.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Professor Agni!

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, Vega?

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, Vega?

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's horrible, Prof.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Vega?

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't you watch the competition?

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There's something more important than the competition.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What is it, Vega?

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Professor Titan.

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong with Professor Titan?

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Professor Titan, who has been in our school, is a fake.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He's the eighth ghost.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The eighth ghost?

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes, Prof.

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Professor Titan was trapped in the closet.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I saw it, Prof.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I even helped Professor Titan.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But, when I didn't help him,

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the eighth ghost attacked me again.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you sure about this, Vega?

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, Prof.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's why Professor Titan followed me.

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's watch it together.

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go, Prof.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Where are you, Raya?

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why did you just disappear?

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't see the other ghosts.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Raya, where are you?

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Raya, don't disappear!

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Raya!

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's a pity that you didn't get the ghost.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I got the ghost.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now, I'm going to win.

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Bye.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Bye.

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't come in.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's why you shouldn't tease people.

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I should find another ghost.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So, I can win.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Bye.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ouch.

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Watch your bike.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't scratch it.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It hurts.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ouch.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Your body is stiff.

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It hurts.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's take a rest here.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Raya.

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The ghosts haven't come out yet.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Where are they?

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's look for them.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Poor Raya.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Raya is so brave.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's our duty to catch her.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She's a ghost hunter.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Where is she?

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She's over there.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She's over there.

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where is she?

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're done, Alva.

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The ghosts are hiding.

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You won't get the ghost.

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I got an idea.

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hey, there's a river of life.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's so cool.

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There's a river of life.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's a river of life.

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Alva, where's the river of life?

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Give it to me.

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's right here.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Where is it?

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can't go anywhere now.

145
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Alva, you cheated on me.

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let me go.

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Move.

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go inside.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, Vega.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not safe.

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's make sure it's true.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Professor Titan.

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Excuse me, Professor Titan.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Professor Titan.

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Please, come in.

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's go.

157
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Professor.

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Smile.

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's a beautiful and handsome Professor Agni.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The arrival of Professor Agni doesn't bother me.

162
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But, this is a blessing for me.

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Welcome.

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Welcome.

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I present this beautiful flower...

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
...to Professor Agni.

167
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's so beautiful.

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't pretend.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Where's the real Professor Titan?

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Vega, you have to be polite.

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's impossible.

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's impossible.

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Professor Titan.

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

176
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I didn't mean to suspect you.

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There have been a lot of strange things...

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
...that happened in our school.

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If I may know...

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
...and if you don't mind...

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
...may I know...

182
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
...the contents of that closet?

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The contents of that closet...

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
...are for my experiment, Professor.

185
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're lying.

186
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Professor Agni.

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ask him to open it.

188
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Professor.

189
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Can we see the contents of that closet?

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
If you don't mind.

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Of course not.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
For Professor Agni...

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
...I will prepare it.

194
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Let me go, Alva.

195
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let me go.

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let me go, Alva.

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're Alva, aren't you?

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let me go.

199
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mommy, you go first.

200
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Let me go, Alva.

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why is she there?

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Hurry up.

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes, be patient.

204
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Be strong.

205
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Get that liquid.

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let me go.

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Let me go, Alva.

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let me go, Alva.

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let me go, Alva.

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let me go, Alva.

211
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me go, Alva.

212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let me go, Alva.

213
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Alva, let me go.

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Professor.

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That baby is so cute.

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

217
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is impossible.

218
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I saw the real Professor Titan.

219
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is impossible.

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I saw it myself.

221
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I even helped him.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Vega.

223
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's enough, Vega.

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's just leave it there.

225
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The baby knows it now.

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Right?

227
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry, Professor Titan.

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Maybe Vega...

229
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
...is not feeling well.

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's why he can make up stories like that.

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not sick, Professor.

232
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're not sick, Vega.

233
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But we're stressed and nervous.

234
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's because you're always studying.

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Right?

236
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's right.

237
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm stressed and nervous.

238
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, I'm not.

239
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're lying.

240
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Vega.

241
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's enough, Vega.

242
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's enough, Professor.

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We'll leave now, Professor.

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Excuse me.

246
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes, Professor.

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Professor.

248
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Vega.

249
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're embarrassing me.

250
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not lying, Professor.

251
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I saw it myself.

252
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He's evil.

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He's a liar.

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He's a fake.

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's enough, Vega.

256
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're overreacting.

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If we're like this, it can be called a slander.

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you understand?

259
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No, Professor.

260
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm sure...

261
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
...the real Professor Titan...

262
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
...can be hidden by him.

263
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's enough, Vega.

264
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You should focus on the competition now.

265
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You should support Alfa...

266
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
...because Alfa needs your support.

267
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
How can I convince Professor Agni?

268
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sure...

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
...the real Professor Titan...

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
...can be hidden somewhere else.

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sure...

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
...the real Professor Titan...

273
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
...can be hidden somewhere else.

274
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sure...

275
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
...the real Professor Titan...

276
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
...can be hidden somewhere else.

277
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Now, it's time for me to take action.

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can't give up.

279
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I have to prove to Professor Agni...

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
...that Professor Titan is fake.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But, how?

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I know.

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Gosh.

284
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There are so many books.

285
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I must have read them for a long time.

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But, it's okay.

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can find it.

288
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I have to find out...

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
...where he is.

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Give me a smile.

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
There he is.

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Gosh.

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He's not here.

294
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
He must be investigating me.

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He's the only one...

296
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
...who doesn't trust me.

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Disguising...

298
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
...is the most perfect way.

299
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Maybe, this is the book.

300
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Disguising is the most perfect way.

301
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is a very difficult black magic.

302
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's controlled by a great sorcerer.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sure...

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
...this is the book's guide.

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes.

306
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's only one way to prove it.

307
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That is by using...

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
...the book.

309
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The book is flying.

310
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The book.

311
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What are you doing?

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Come here.

313
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The book.

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I want to read it.

315
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't go.

316
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The book.

317
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Where's the book?

318
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Where's the book?

319
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The book.

320
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The book.

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't go.

322
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Gosh.

323
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The book.

324
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The book.

325
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The book.

326
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Gosh.

327
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The book is gone.

328
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's gone again.

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The book.

330
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Wait.

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm going to find out...

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
...where it is.

333
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Ouch. It hurts.

334
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The book.

335
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why is this in the toilet?

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hi.

337
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Give me a smile.

338
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Feel the difference.

339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I still have a lot of work to do.

340
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Bye.

341
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The book.

342
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The book.

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What are you waiting for?

344
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The book.

345
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The book.

346
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's gone again.

347
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
There's only one way.

348
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The book.

349
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The book.

350
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Get ready.

351
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The time will come.

352
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The time will come.

353
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The time will come.

354
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The time will come.

355
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hurry up, Tom.

356
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
We're almost there.

357
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
We're almost there.

358
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We're almost there.

359
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The book.

360
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The book.

361
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The book.

362
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
This is weird.

363
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Why is the place different?

364
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What's that?

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's go.

366
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
To be continued...

367
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What's that?

368
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What's that?

369
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What's that?

370
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What's that?

371
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What's that?

372
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What's that?

373
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
This is dangerous.

374
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
SOS.

375
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Where is it coming from?

376
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Where is it coming from?

377
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Calm down.

378
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I think it's going to explode.

379
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Calm down.

380
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We don't know yet.

381
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That's SOS.

382
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's dangerous.

383
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
What if something happens?

384
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What should we do?

385
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Agni, take care of the kids.

386
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes, sir.

387
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm coming with you.

388
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Everyone is watching the race right now.

389
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can take over this place.

390
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Where is it coming from?

391
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Where is it coming from?

392
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Here it is.

393
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The soul stone that I've been looking for.

394
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I've got the soul stone.

395
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I can destroy this school.

396
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm going to destroy this school.

397
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I can destroy this school.

398
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Tommy.

399
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What's wrong?

400
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Did you make the SOS sign?

401
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes, sir.

402
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I made the SOS sign.

403
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because...

404
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The ticket is gone.

405
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And the alpha is gone too.

406
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We were holding the ticket.

407
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Then, there was a strong wind.

408
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We appeared in another place.

409
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Then, there was a raptor.

410
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It attacked me.

411
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Then, I brought the wind.

412
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And I came back here.

413
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But, the alpha didn't come back here.

414
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's it, sir.

415
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
How could it be?

416
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
How did you move places?

417
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't understand.

418
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What is this, sir?

419
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It looks like someone...

420
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
turned the winning ticket into a moving tool.

421
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That tool moved the alpha to another place.

422
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't know where it is.

423
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Why did Tommy come back? But, the alpha didn't.

424
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It looks like this person only wants the alpha.

425
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's why he brought Tommy back.

426
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
This must be the work of Professor Titan.

427
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I think...

428
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
he did this to hurt the alpha.

429
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That's nonsense.

430
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
A professor should learn something new.

431
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So, why did he hurt the alpha?

432
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He just got to know the alpha.

433
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm right.

434
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
There's a fake Professor Titan.

435
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And the real one is hidden in his room.

436
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Are you sure?

437
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yes, I'm very sure.

438
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
He's using a magical tool.

439
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Actually, he's the Dark Lord.

440
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
How did you know that he's the Dark Lord?

441
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Because I saw his shadow in the school mirror.

442
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The Dark Lord

443
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Don't tell me you're right, Vega.

444
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
He changed the world...

445
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
with the greatest transformation spell.

446
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yes, Professor.

447
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The spell is very powerful.

448
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Because I poured water on him.

449
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But he didn't change.

450
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Wow.

451
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Maybe this spell was made by the soldiers yesterday.

452
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The weakness is only the mirror.

453
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I don't know.

454
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You're so naive.

455
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We were taught to change the world by the soldiers.

456
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The weakness is only the mirror.

457
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So, if we look at the mirror, we can see the real one.

458
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I have to check everything.

459
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes, Professor.

460
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We have to go to school.

461
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We have to ask Professor Titan...

462
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
where he hid the alpha.

463
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Vega.

464
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Vega.

465
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Fire.

466
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Fire.

467
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Fire.

468
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Fire.

469
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Love with a smile.

470
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I've installed all the devices.

471
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Soon...

472
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
there will be a huge fire festival here.

473
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,800
The Triangle

474
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
What's that?

475
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What is this?

476
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What is it?

477
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Professor

478
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Professor

479
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Professor Rahmi

480
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Professor, it looks like someone is attacking our school

481
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Our school?

482
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Hurry up, we need to evacuate as soon as possible

483
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yes, Professor

484
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Let's go, Figa

485
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The Triangle

486
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Enjoy this mess, Adembaran

487
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Normal

488
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Ha ha ha ha

489
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
With this blood, my power will be truly perfect

490
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And soon, I will rule the world

491
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The Triangle

492
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Our school will be destroyed

493
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
If our school is destroyed, where are we going to study?

494
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Don't worry, our school will be closed

495
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh no

496
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Jack, don't say that

497
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What are we going to do?

498
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Let's go

499
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But I don't want to go there

500
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Professor Gita

501
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Professor Gita

502
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Professor Gita

503
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Professor Gita

504
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Professor Gita

505
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Professor Gita

506
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Professor Gita

507
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Professor Gita

508
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
What's that sound?

509
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Professor Gita, stay away from this wall

510
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I will destroy it

511
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
What do you mean destroy?

512
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Professor Gita

513
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Do you want to die?

514
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Thank you for your help

515
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Thank you very much

516
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You're welcome

517
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
We have to get out of here

518
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes

519
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Professor Gita

520
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Professor Gita

521
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Professor Gita

522
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Are you okay?

523
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I found Professor Gita behind the wall in his room

524
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Behind the wall?

525
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yes

526
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The Dark Lord possessed me

527
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
He even bewitched me

528
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, Vega's story is true

529
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What do you mean?

530
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Vega told me that the Professor Titan in the school is fake

531
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And the real one is hidden in the closet

532
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But I didn't believe him

533
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Do you mean that girl?

534
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Vega is not lying

535
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
He once helped me

536
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But the Dark Lord is stronger

537
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I was caught again

538
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And Vega was made to faint again

539
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Let's go!

540
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Let's go, Pindu!

541
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
She's so strong

542
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
She can't hide

543
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Professor!

544
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Professor!

545
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Professor!

546
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Professor!

547
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Professor!

548
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Where did he go?

549
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I think he's just looking for my blood

550
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Maybe

551
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Hey, wait!

552
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
What?

553
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The school is on fire

554
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Why is there always a problem in this school?

555
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Don't worry

556
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You can't change the situation

557
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Let's just look for Alpha

558
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The situation?

559
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Let's just look for Alpha

560
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Huh?

561
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Look for what?

562
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The telescope

563
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Hello!

564
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The telescope is in the old classroom

565
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Did you ask me to go there?

566
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You can burn the telescope?

567
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Hello! You can also use magic

568
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What about you?

569
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Hurry up!

570
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Get the telescope!

571
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's a tsunami!

572
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Freeze!

573
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Here!

574
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I want to look for Alpha

575
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
She's not here yet

576
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Did you find her?

577
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Not yet

578
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm still concentrating

579
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No, I'm concentrating

580
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I think the telescope is broken because of the fire

581
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I don't care

582
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Let's go to Pripin

583
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Let's look for Alpha using OPPO

584
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Oh no, Raptor

585
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
He's so fast today

586
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
How can I follow him?

587
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I have to use another way

588
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh, right

589
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I forgot to turn around

590
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Where's Lollipop?

591
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This is a good idea

592
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I have to find Lollipop

593
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's easier this way

594
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
There he is!

595
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I got you, Lollipop!

596
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I got you, Lollipop!

597
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's easier this way

598
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Why did the Raptor stop?

599
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Whatever, I'm going to stop too

600
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
He's still alive!

601
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Raptor!

602
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You've done what I told you to do

603
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You've got Alpha's tender

604
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Of course, I did it

605
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Good job!

606
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Good job!

607
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
A perfect plan

608
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You're right

609
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Your plan to make me turn into a Raptor

610
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's amazing

611
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Angkara!

612
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yes, sir

613
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Angkara

614
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Now, I want you to turn into a Raptor

615
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
What for, sir?

616
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The ring that I have

617
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
is now owned by Alpha

618
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and he can't be attacked

619
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
In fact, my attack goes back to me

620
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
That's why I want you to turn into a Raptor

621
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Because that ring

622
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
won't work

623
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
if I turn you into him

624
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yes, sir

625
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
How do I look, sir?

626
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Good, Angkara

627
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Perfect

628
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Raptor

629
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Go back to your place

630
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Now

631
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
take the ring

632
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and turn into a Raptor

633
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
What for, sir?

634
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But the best part is

635
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
you turned into Professor Titan

636
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Everything was easy

637
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Even Alpha

638
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So, Raptor is...

639
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Raptor is Professor Angkara?

640
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
What a perfect disguise

641
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Even Aldebaran was fooled

642
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But there's one person who wasn't

643
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Vega

644
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But we don't need to worry

645
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Because there's no one who trusts him

646
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
In fact

647
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
he was attacked by his own teacher

648
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Professor Titan

649
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So, Professor Titan

650
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
is the inspiration of the Dark Lord?

651
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Professor Titan

652
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
is the inspiration of the Dark Lord?

653
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So, I was attacked?

654
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
What?

655
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I woke up from my dream

656
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So, I think

657
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Professor Titan

658
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
has something to do with the Dark Lord

659
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Vega is right

660
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But I and Retole

661
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
don't trust Vega

662
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm mad at Vega

663
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm sorry, Vega

664
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't trust you anymore

665
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Actually, I'm a warrior

666
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
All of this can be avoided

667
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
With this blood

668
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
my power will be perfect

669
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And soon

670
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I will rule the world

671
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What should I do now?

672
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
To be continued...

673
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Look at the TV!

674
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Look at the TV!

675
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Fire! Fire!

676
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Fire! Fire!

677
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
How long will it take, sir?

678
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Soon, sir

679
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Soon, Ramuan will be ready

680
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And I will get perfect power

681
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Unlimited power!

682
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
We have to help Robert Dewi!

683
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But how, Vega?

684
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The fire is getting bigger!

685
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
If we go forward, we can burn it!

686
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Retole!

687
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Fire! Fire!

688
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
What should we do?

689
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Bro! Bro!

690
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Let us help Robert Dewi!

691
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yes, sir!

692
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
We are tired of being together

693
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let us help him!

694
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yes, sir!

695
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Let us help him!

696
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
We are special kids

697
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
We want to help too!

698
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Alright

699
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Be careful

700
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Are you sure this is the right way?

701
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Do you want me to help?

702
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You don't have to

703
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
There are three of us

704
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We can make it

705
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Let's go!

706
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Wait for me!

707
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Bye!

708
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Be careful!

709
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Be careful!

710
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Don't get close!

711
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Don't get close!

712
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Be careful!

713
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Help!

714
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Help!

715
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Be careful, Retole!

716
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Retole!

717
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I'm scared!

718
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm scared!

719
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Help me!

720
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Help me!

721
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Calm down!

722
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I will help Ray and Tole

723
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Megantara

724
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Megantara

725
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Let me and Prof. Titan help you

726
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Hi!

727
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Give me a smile, Prof. Agni

728
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Just leave it to me

729
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I can handle it myself

730
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Agni! Agni!

731
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Robert!

732
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Let's go to Prof. Dewi!

733
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
No!

734
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's dangerous!

735
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Agni!

736
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Let's jump!

737
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I will catch you from here!

738
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
No!

739
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
My face will be ruined!

740
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Agni!

741
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
If you don't jump, it will explode!

742
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
No!

743
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It will explode!

744
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It's time

745
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Ramuan...

746
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
...has been mixed with sempurna

747
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I can't wait any longer, sir

748
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Here's your water, sir

749
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Alva!

750
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Alva!

751
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Give me back the bottle, Alva!

752
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
How dare you take the bottle from me, Alva!

753
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Give it back!

754
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Why not?

755
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's clear

756
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
This is my tears, my sweat, and my blood

757
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So, this is mine!

758
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
The point is

759
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
The evil

760
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Will never win!

761
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The evil will never win!

762
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The evil will never win!

763
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
The evil will never win!

764
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
The evil will never win!

765
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Why are you interfering?

766
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I can't just stand by

767
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I have to help Pangeran in the dark

768
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
The evil will never win!

769
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's broken!

770
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The evil will never win!

771
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
The evil will never win!

772
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
The evil will never win!

773
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Drink it, Pangeran

774
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And get your power back

775
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Alva, run!

776
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Alva, run!

777
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Alva, run!

778
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The evil will never win!

779
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Alva

780
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
This time, you will lose

781
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Because Pangeran the Dark

782
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Will soon change its destiny

783
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I'll bite you!

784
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
The evil will never win!

785
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
The evil will never win!

786
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We won!

787
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We can do this!

788
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
We can do this!

789
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Now

790
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
My power has really increased

791
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Pangeran the Dark has become very strong

792
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
No one can defeat me

793
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Including you, Alva

794
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Congratulations, sir

795
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You can do this, sir

796
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Release him

797
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Let him help from below

798
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Release him

799
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Let's do it

800
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
There's no way Pangeran will catch us

801
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
All right, let's count to three

802
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
One

803
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Two

804
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Three

805
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Go!

806
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Are you all right?

807
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Thank you, sir

808
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Thank you, sir

809
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
No, help me!

810
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Come on, Doctor, please

811
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Jump!

812
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
If you don't, you'll get burned

813
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
What? Jump?

814
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Are you crazy?

815
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
No, no, no!

816
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Please!

817
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Hurry!

818
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Hurry!

819
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Jump!

820
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
We did it!

821
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It doesn't hurt

822
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It's so amazing!

823
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's okay, Doctor

824
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
But I can't be a magician

825
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I'm sorry, Professor

826
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Professor, what happened? Are you okay?

827
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Professor, are you okay?

828
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
What?

829
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Professor

830
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I'm sorry, Doctor

831
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm sorry

832
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I didn't mean to

833
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
The damage is severe

834
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
The damage is severe

835
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The soul stone is gone

836
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Pangeran will take it

837
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Professor Lodebaran

838
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
What about the damage?

839
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What's so bad about it?

840
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It's not about the damage

841
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's not a problem

842
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
We can always build this school with the power of magic

843
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
But now

844
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
There's a bigger problem

845
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Pangeran Kegelapan

846
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
He stole the soul stone from my room

847
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
What?

848
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
With the soul stone

849
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Pangeran Kegelapan will be difficult to defeat

850
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
He can split his soul into 12 parts

851
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And put those parts in different places

852
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Next

853
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He will be very difficult to defeat

854
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Unless we can destroy the 12 parts of the stone

855
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This is bad

856
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I'm going to kill you

857
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I'm going to kill you

858
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm going to kill you

859
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Call the ambulance

860
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Call the ambulance

861
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Now

862
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I'm going to kill you

863
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm sorry

864
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
This ring doesn't affect me anymore

865
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Because my power is now

866
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Much greater

867
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
What are you doing?

868
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I'm going to kill you

869
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm going to kill you

870
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
How is it?

871
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Do you want to see?

872
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
What is this?

873
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I'm going to kill you

874
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Hurry up

875
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I'm going to kill you

876
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I have to survive

877
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I don't want to be defeated like my father and mother

878
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Father

879
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Mother

880
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Please help me

881
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Father

882
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Mother

883
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Please help me

884
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
With these twelve stones

885
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I will divide my soul into twelve

886
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And I'm sure

887
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
The invaders will have a hard time facing me

888
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Huh?

889
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
What is this?

890
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
What is this?

891
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Help!

892
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Let us go!

893
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
That voice again

894
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Don't give up

895
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Chase your passion and dreams

896
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Go, go, go

897
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Achieve all your dreams

898
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Go, go, go

899
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Never stop

900
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Go, go, go

901
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Fight with your heart

902
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Go, go, go

903
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Make yourself proud

904
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Go, go, go

905
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Let's go

906
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
We can do it
