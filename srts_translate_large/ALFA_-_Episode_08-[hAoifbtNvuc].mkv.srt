1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,460
Keep going...

4
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,120
GO, GO, GO

5
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,940
Make yourself proud

6
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,620
GO, GO, GO

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,260
Come on let's dream

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,480
GO, GO, GO

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,880
We can definitely do this

10
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,640
Come Kids

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
We'll certainly find out what happened

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,200
Megantara

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,300
It is better that you take all the children out of here

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,960
and do not let a single one fly away

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
GO, GO, GO

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Professor

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,000
Who installed this horrible magic in this gate?

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know either, Megantara

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's clear is that you can't leave this village

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and we can't enter the village

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You saved Popo

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because you saved Popo

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now you're going to hurt Popo

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The magical door managed to beat the monster

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and locked it in a secret cave

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No one knows where the secret cave is

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This magic is not permanent

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the monster can be released

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And later we have to find out

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who is the descendant of the magical door

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
who can lock the monster in it?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm surprised

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How can a snake talk to you?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm also surprised

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I used to talk to a snake

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe it's the descendant of the magical door

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nonsense

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't be the descendant of the magical door

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I just came here once

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, nonsense

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can be the descendant of the magical door

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can lock the monster in it

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did your parents ever tell you about Uncle Wickham?

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know them

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't even know who they are

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My parents said

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They died a good man

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're so stupid

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't be silly

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dava, can you hear me?

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We have to learn magic from him

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If not, we'll be locked in a cave

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to learn too

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's learn together

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I want to learn too

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's that?

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a small magic for me

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can get rid of it

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Right?

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because he's a king

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm the king

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're pretending to be retired

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Just say it

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, I'm not

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm really retired

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It looks like they're more confident now

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because they've got a new magic

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's good

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But we can't give up

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We have to find out more about this attack

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Professor Purwa, what do you think?

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you have any clue?

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The book doesn't mention what kind of monster it is

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let alone the weakness

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If it's like this, how can we defeat it?

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And we can't go home

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because the village gate is haunted by a very powerful magic

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We're all trapped here

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alva, it's so scary

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's wrong, Vega?

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The teachers already know about the monster

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But they covered us so we won't be scared

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's worse, the village gate is haunted by a very powerful magic

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So the students can't get out

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's why the professor can't get in

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The professor can't get in

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think someone's trying to save us

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How is it?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The monster has attacked two of our students

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How long do I have to wait?

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Soon, sir

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They're locked in the village

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All the students will turn into stone

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Including that special student

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you just have to wait

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm bored here

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I want to go back to school

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes, the food is not good

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's a story

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's about a girl

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Her name is Alva

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Her name is Alva

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a story about a girl

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, tell us the story

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you want this?

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
My chocolate is taken, give it back

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My chocolate, give it back

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What's wrong?

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My chocolate is taken by Jack and Mike

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They ran away

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't care

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I know, in a situation like this

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You're still looking for trouble

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Rita, don't be sad

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll chase them

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't worry, I'll go with you

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ray, don't be late

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It smells good

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What's wrong?

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why did you stop?

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's chase Jack and Mike

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, let's go

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Ouch

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My foot hurts

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Wait for me

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mike?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mike!

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's Jack's voice

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe it's another monster

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mike!

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Help!

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Help!

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm scared

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Jack saw Mike being attacked

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's why he's still in shock

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's enough

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go inside

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry, Professor Furwa

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let Mike take care of it

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alva, let's go with them

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How?

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's go

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Kids

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't go anywhere

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Stay here

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And always be alert

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's wrong?

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Nothing

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Nothing?

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Nothing

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is a drink for you

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're welcome

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're welcome

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're welcome

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If you drink that

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You'll be calm

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now tell me what happened

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Just now

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I was putting on my shoes

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Then Mike ran away

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Then the monster came

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It was scary

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then it turned Mike into a rock

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's the first time

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Something like this happened

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Usually

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Students are attacked

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When they're alone

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Professor Agni

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's read his mind

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, Professor

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Ouch

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It hurts

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Mike, wait

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hurry

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Mike!

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Mike!

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Mike!

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The monster is huge

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Looks like

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The monster likes chocolate

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's weird

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
How can a monster this big

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like chocolate?

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wait, Professor Purwa

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I have to make sure

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
How is it, Professor Agni?

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Looks like it's true

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When Tole was attacked

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There was chocolate

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, Sir

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And when Nick was attacked

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
In Nick's test

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He was carrying chocolate

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't know

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But I'm sure

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There was chocolate

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, Sir

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But he was carrying chocolate

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Megantara

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Go back to your students

212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Watch them

213
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't let anyone panic

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And take care of them

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't let anyone pass through the village

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It can be very dangerous for them

217
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Professor

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Megantara

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How is Jake, Megantara?

220
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't worry

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Jake is resting

222
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's sleeping

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What about Mike?

224
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Mike is

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
On medication

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Medication with mushrooms

227
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Aren't you scared?

228
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, Sir

229
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We're not scared

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Right, guys?

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Good

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Who said we're not scared?

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This place is getting stranger

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And more dangerous

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But it's our turn to help

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Guys

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's get out of here

238
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Agree?

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Now we know

240
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The monster likes chocolate

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So we have to help our friends

242
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So they won't eat chocolate

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I agree

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So they won't be attacked by the monster

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Let's go

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Let's go

247
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's go

248
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's go

249
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hurry up!

250
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We're late

251
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's dangerous

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They're running away

253
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll go through the village gate

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I have to stop them

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Tantara!

256
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Tantara!

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Tantara!

258
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Tantara!

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Tantara!

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Tantara!

261
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Tantara!

262
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Tantara!

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Tantara!

264
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Where are you going?

265
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Tantara!

266
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Now

267
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's time for the monster to do its job

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
To be continued...

269
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You're not afraid

270
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But you want to run away

271
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Now go back to your house

273
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We want to go home

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We want to go back to school

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We want to go home

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This place is getting dangerous

277
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So that's all you got?

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Listen

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're special kids

280
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're spoiled kids

281
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're not loved by other kids

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you're afraid

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't have the courage

284
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What's the difference between you and other kids?

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Do you know why you're asked to stay here?

286
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you?

287
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Look at this

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Tantara!

289
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This place is haunted by a black magic

290
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If we go through it

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You'll all be destroyed

292
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What do we do now?

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What do we do now?

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's fight it

295
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Remember

296
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're special kids

297
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Go back to being farmers

298
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Go back to being heroes

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Agree?

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Agree!

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Louder! Agree?

302
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Agree!

303
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Courage?

304
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Courage!

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's it

306
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now you know the situation

307
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But

308
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't be alarmed

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You have to calm down

310
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And be ready to face it

311
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You have to be happy

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We can't, we're scared

313
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes, we're scared

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
This fear is our enemy's target

315
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If we're scared, the enemy will be happy

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But if we're happy

317
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The enemy will be jealous of us

318
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do you understand?

319
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes, sir!

320
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's a good idea

321
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry, sir

322
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Never mind

323
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Ms. Futar!

324
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
One

325
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Two

326
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Three

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Four

328
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Five

329
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's not fun

330
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's do it again

331
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I want to win

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We want to win!

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What if we lose?

334
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We want to win!

335
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
We want to win!

336
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We want to win!

337
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What if we lose?

338
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We want to win!

339
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Now it's your turn

340
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Ms. Futar

341
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes, I'm so happy

342
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sometimes I play alone

343
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't have friends here

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But from now on

345
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You won't be lonely

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Because we're your friends

347
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But if you go back to school

348
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll be lonely

349
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I promise

350
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We'll come here often

351
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
See you later

352
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Looks like they're having fun

353
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to take advantage of the situation

354
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What are you doing here?

355
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Me?

356
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You want to make trouble, don't you?

357
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's right

358
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And you

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You're going to help me do that

360
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Opo

361
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Are you going to help me do that?

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Opo

363
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What's this?

364
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
This is a communication mirror

365
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If you use this mirror

366
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Even if it's far away

367
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We can talk

368
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Cool

369
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Let's try it

370
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Fega

371
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Can you see me?

372
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yes, I can

373
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Can you see me?

374
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Of course, Fega

375
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Be careful, Fega

376
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Are you going to hurt Fega?

377
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Opo

378
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I know

379
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
How to make you happy

380
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
How, Opo?

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
How about

382
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We make something delicious

383
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What is it, Opo?

384
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Opo

385
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Opo

386
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Let's see

387
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Let's go

388
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Good

389
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Very good

390
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Finally, my plan went well

391
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And now

392
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's time for the monster legenda to do its job

393
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You have to destroy all the chocolates in the village

394
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
If necessary

395
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Destroy all the chocolate trees there

396
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So the villagers can't make chocolates anymore

397
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes, sir

398
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yes, sir

399
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And remember

400
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Watch the children

401
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Their safety is very important

402
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yes, sir

403
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I will try to find another way

404
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
To enter the village

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Hey, don't go

406
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Hey, don't go

407
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Hey, don't go

408
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Hey, don't go

409
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Opo

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Opo, Opo, Opo

411
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What are you doing here, Opo?

412
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Milk

413
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What?

414
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Kawat, Kawat

415
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We're all in danger

416
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Danger?

417
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What do you mean, Opo?

418
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The children

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I taught them how to make chocolates

420
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Children?

421
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Who are you?

422
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm their friend

423
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I told you to stay away

424
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Vega

425
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hey

426
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Vega

427
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The children are making chocolates

428
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Huh?

429
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Chocolates?

430
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That means

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That means

432
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The monster is coming

433
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yes

434
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We're in danger

435
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We have to stop it

436
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let's go

437
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Let's go

438
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It looks like a monster

439
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Opo

440
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Run

441
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It looks delicious

442
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Opo

443
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Tommy, Tommy

444
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Don't eat the chocolates here

445
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You all throw these chocolates away

446
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We're tired of making these chocolates

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Then, why did you tell us to throw these chocolates away?

448
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We don't know

449
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Tommy, Jack

450
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
These chocolates are dangerous

451
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
These chocolates can lure the monster here

452
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Don't lie

453
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There's no monster that likes chocolates

454
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's you

455
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Guys, take care of the chocolates

456
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Don't let Alva and Rai steal them

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Why?

458
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I don't want to be told

459
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Go away

460
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Go away

461
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Go away

462
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Tantara

463
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Tantara

464
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Tantara

465
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Tantara

466
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Why do I smell chocolate here?

467
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, Tantara

468
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
They're making chocolates

469
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Huh?

470
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes

471
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't understand

472
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Why are there so many chocolates here?

473
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Tantara told us to have fun

474
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But we're making chocolates

475
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Tantara, it's delicious

476
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Now, throw all these chocolates away

477
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Why do we have to throw them away?

478
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The chocolates are delicious

479
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
These chocolates

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Will make a disaster for all of you

481
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you know your friends?

482
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Mike, Jack, and Tole

483
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Why are they happy?

484
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because they're eating chocolates

485
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you're still making chocolates

486
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It means you're ready to be eaten by the monster

487
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Tantara, run!

488
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Tantara, run!

489
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Tantara, run!

490
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Go away

491
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And bring the food

492
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Go, Tantara

493
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Do your job

494
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And destroy them

495
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Tantara

496
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We can do it

497
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
We can do it

498
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Huh?

499
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is the only way

500
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
For me to join the organization

501
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Davatang Avanza

502
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yippie!

503
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yippie!

504
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We're back!

505
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why is he calling us?

506
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He must be working for us

507
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hey, young ladies

508
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm here

509
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
To invite you to a competition

510
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
A competition?

511
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yes

512
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The loser

513
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Has to follow the winner's will

514
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
What do you think?

515
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What do you think?

516
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Why?

517
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you scared?

518
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's delicious

519
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
We're never scared

520
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Especially with a man

521
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on, Yippie

522
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yippie, let's get changed

523
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Enough!

524
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I admit defeat

525
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You're amazing, Putri Angsa

526
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We don't believe in men's words

527
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
We're not men

528
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We're men

529
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Okay, okay

530
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Now, you can punish me

531
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Whatever it is

532
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'll do it

533
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You can punish me

534
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Whatever it is

535
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But please

536
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Don't put me in the water

537
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because I'm most afraid of water

538
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Especially in this lake

539
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
There's a hole

540
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That can lead to the magic village

541
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't take me there

542
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm afraid of the place

543
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm afraid of the hole

544
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He's afraid of the hole

545
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's just take him there

546
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So he won't be afraid

547
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because you're afraid of water

548
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Afraid of the lake

549
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We'll take you to the magic village

550
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Come here

551
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Let's go

552
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Let's go

553
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Thank you for showing me the way

554
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Let's go

555
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
One

556
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Two

557
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Three

558
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Tentara

559
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Tentara

560
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm scared, dad

561
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Lurah Galaksi

562
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You'd better hurry

563
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Let's go, professor

564
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's go

565
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Tentara

566
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Let's go

567
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Tentara

568
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Let's go

569
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm afraid of the hole

570
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Now you have to remember, Alva

571
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Don't look at the sparkling eyes

572
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Remember

573
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Don't look at the sparkling eyes

574
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Maybe

575
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The sparkling eyes

576
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Are the snake eyes

577
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Guys

578
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Don't look at the snake eyes

579
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Guys

580
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Wait for me

581
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
What's wrong?

582
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It's dangerous

583
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I have to help them

584
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't, dad

585
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It's dangerous

586
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Just run

587
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Help

588
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Don't, dad

589
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Alva

590
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Alva

591
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Alva

592
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Alva is so close

593
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yes

594
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm going to catch up with you, Nisa

595
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You're so slow

596
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Ri

597
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Ri

598
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
We can enter

599
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Let's go

600
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Wow, this is fun

601
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Ri, wake up

602
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Ri

603
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Alva

604
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Ri

605
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hey

606
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Don't look at the eyes

607
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Hey

608
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Don't look at the snake eyes

609
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Alva

610
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Alva

611
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Alva

612
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The phantom

613
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Help

614
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Help

615
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Alva

616
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Help

617
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Alva

618
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Help

619
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Alva

620
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
He's in there

621
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
He's come out

622
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Alva

623
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Happy Eid

624
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm glad I'm not a stone, Alva

625
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Happy Eid

626
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Alva

627
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Happy Eid

628
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Happy Eid

629
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Happy Eid

630
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Mike

631
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Mike

632
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Why did you turn into a stone?

633
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Anis also turned into a stone

634
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He's in there, Mike

635
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Let's attack him

636
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Infiltrate

637
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
We can do this

638
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We can do this

639
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We can do this

640
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
What are you two doing here?

641
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Praise be to Allah

642
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It's a normal quest

643
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Normal?

644
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What happened to me?

645
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You turned into a stone

646
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Enough

647
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We don't want to make a scene

648
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Let's get out of here

649
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm sure our friends know what happened to us

650
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Let's go

651
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Hurry up

652
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Let's go

653
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That snake is huge

654
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Don't be happy yet, Alva

655
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The snake is not dead

656
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It's just running away

657
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So the snake can come back?

658
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It can come back if it smells like chocolate

659
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We have to get out of here

660
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Take the kids out of this village

661
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I've found a way to get out of this village

662
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But Professor

663
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What about the mantra that has blocked this village?

664
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That mantra is for us

665
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Once we get out of here

666
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The mantra will be gone

667
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Rey

668
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Wake up

669
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Rey

670
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Wake up

671
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Alva

672
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You didn't eat the monster, did you?

673
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
No

674
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's all messed up

675
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What's going on?

676
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Maybe they're playing war

677
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Hurry up

678
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Hurry up

679
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Hold it

680
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Rey

681
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Kids

682
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Let's go back to school

683
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Let's go back to school

684
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Professor

685
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
What about the monster?

686
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We managed to get rid of the monster

687
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But it's not dead

688
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Only you

689
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
You have to stay alert

690
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And now

691
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
We have to go back to school

692
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Take the kids to a safer place

693
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But I and the teachers will come back here

694
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
To get rid of the monster

695
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Thank you very much, Professor Adebaran

696
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Rita

697
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I have to go

698
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You'll come back here, won't you?

699
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Of course

700
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But don't forget

701
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
To contact us through this number

702
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This well connects to the lake around our school

703
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And we'll go in there one by one

704
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
As soon as you get in

705
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You have to swim as fast as you can

706
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
To the lake

707
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You'll pair up

708
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And the teachers will help you

709
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Okay

710
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Let's go

711
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Let's go

712
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Let's go

713
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Let's go

714
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Let's go

715
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Let's go

716
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Let's go

717
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Let's go

718
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Let's go

719
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And the teachers will help you

720
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Wait

721
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Don't think you can easily leave this village

722
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Nice to meet you, Ankara

723
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But unfortunately

724
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
We have to say goodbye

725
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh

726
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Don't be arrogant, Adebaran

727
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The knowledge I have now

728
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Is far better than the last time we fought

729
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Ankara

730
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Don't talk too much

731
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You don't even want to defeat me

732
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
How can you defeat Professor Adebaran?

733
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Professor

734
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It's better

735
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
To bring your children

736
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So that one day

737
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm here

738
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
To be continued

739
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
To be continued

740
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
To be continued

741
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
To be continued

742
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
To be continued

743
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
To be continued

744
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
To be continued

745
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
To be continued

746
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I have not lost

747
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And I will never lose

748
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
To be continued

749
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Everyone is already home

750
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm the only one left alone

751
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Hi, Mahlis

752
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't want people to get hurt because of me

753
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I have to face this

754
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Don't tell anyone

755
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
To be continued

756
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
To be continued

757
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
To be continued

758
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Thank God, there's a miracle

759
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Thank God, there's a miracle

760
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
To be continued

761
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And you tell Alva

762
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
If Alva still wants this child to live

763
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Then she has to surrender

764
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Basar Dincik!

765
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's up to you what you want to say, Alva

766
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
What's important is that you have to find me in Rama

767
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Pelita and Antaboga will be waiting for you

768
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Huh? Antaboga?

769
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You only have 24 hours

770
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
If you're late

771
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Then this child will be gone forever

772
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Forever

773
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I will return to Sihir village

774
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
To lock the monster in Rama's cave

775
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You take care of the children

776
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And stay alert

777
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Because Angkara will not give up so easily

778
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
He will definitely do everything

779
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm sorry, Prof

780
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But the professor can

781
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because as far as I know

782
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
According to the legend

783
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Only the descendants of Mimasati

784
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Who can open and close the cave

785
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I will still try

786
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So that the people of Sihir village can live in peace

787
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Alva!

788
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Don't be stubborn

789
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
If you go there alone

790
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You'll be attacked by those monsters

791
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yes, sir

792
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's report it to the soldiers and the professor

793
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes

794
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They will definitely accompany you

795
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Besides

796
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
If you go with the professor

797
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You'll be protected

798
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yes, sir

799
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
The professor can turn into a bird

800
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yes, sir

801
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Professor Agni can also turn into a cat

802
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The soldiers will definitely change

803
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
No

804
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I have to help him

805
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Alva!

806
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Don't be stubborn

807
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No

808
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'll go back by myself

809
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't want people to be in trouble because of me

810
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I have to handle this

811
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You guys

812
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Don't tell anyone, okay?

813
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Alva!

814
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Alva!

815
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Why is it so close?

816
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's report it to the professor

817
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
God is evil!

818
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
God, leave Popo!

819
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Popo can suffer!

820
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Popo can suffer!

821
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Popo can die!

822
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Popo!

823
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It didn't work

824
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Popo

825
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
What are you doing here?

826
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Popo

827
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Just sit here

828
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Why?

829
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
God Alva

830
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Can come back again?

831
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yes

832
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I'm looking for the treasure

833
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Do you know where the treasure is?

834
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
What are you doing there?

835
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Popo was kidnapped

836
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Rite was arrested

837
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I have to help her

838
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Do you know?

839
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I don't know

840
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Good

841
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Accompany me there

842
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
God Alva

843
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It's so scary there

844
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
There's a ghost

845
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Popo has a bad experience with a ghost

846
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Experience?

847
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
What experience?

848
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So

849
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
At that time

850
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Popo accidentally

851
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Fell into the cave

852
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And

853
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Popo met a ghost

854
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Help me!

855
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Help!

856
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Popo

857
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Where are you?

858
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Help me!

859
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm scared

860
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'm scared

861
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Help me!

862
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Help!

863
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Help!

864
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Help!

865
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I need help

866
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Why on earth is there a homeless here?

867
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Why on earth is there a видели here?

868
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Do they know you came here?

869
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Why on earth is there a homeless here?

870
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The sound of a flute played by the dark lord

871
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
makes Antaboga calm and calm

872
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And since then, Popo became close to the dark lord

873
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So Antaboga can be calm if we play the flute?

874
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I can play the flute

875
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It's not just a flute

876
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Antaboga likes a special kind of music

877
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If you make a mistake, just hit the notes

878
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
If you're angry, Antaboga will slap you

879
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Teach me all the notes

880
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
How? I'll think about it

881
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Come on, Popo. Teach me. Please

882
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay, I'll teach you

883
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Seriously?

884
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Even if you don't like it, even if you're forced to

885
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Thank you, Popo

886
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I'm going back to that village

887
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Pelita wants to be kidnapped by Prof. Angkara

888
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And Prof. Angkara said that I have to go there

889
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
No one can accompany me. I have to go alone

890
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Pelita will be kidnapped

891
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I can do it!

892
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I can do it!

893
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Thank you for teaching me

894
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Popo was hugged

895
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Usually, all gods treat Popo harshly

896
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You shouldn't have brought me on this journey

897
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Do you really know where I am?

898
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Unfortunately, you're too late to know

899
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
To be continued...

900
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
To be continued...
