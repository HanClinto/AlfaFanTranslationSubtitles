1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To be continued...

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Make yourself proud. Go, go, go.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's dream.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can do it.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why don't you act according to my order?

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But, sir...

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shut up!

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't want all my plans to fail.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We'll wait until next month.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The time is now.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mom, what's wrong?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Dad!

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Think!

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What have you done?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Who are you?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You stole my parents.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't ask me.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not lying.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm Alva.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And they're my parents.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We don't have much time.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We only have a short time.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Before the sun sets.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I don't want...

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
...Srigala to become Panji.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you understand?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm ready.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What's wrong?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's wrong?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's wrong?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm scared.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm scared.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Help!

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Srigala!

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Boss, come here.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm scared.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm scared.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm scared.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's wrong?

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's wrong?

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm scared.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to buy a stone.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I can't do it alone.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sir!

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Help!

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's wrong?

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm attacked.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Attacked by what?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm attacked by Srigala.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Srigala?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Srigala came out of...

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
...Panji's house.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's take him to the village doctor.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Professor.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If that's the case.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In my opinion.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's only one way.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Starting tomorrow.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll train the kids.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, they're ready to fight.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But, can they do it?

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They're tough kids.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In the village.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I won't leave them alone.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If necessary.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm ready to sacrifice my life.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Until they run out of blood.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But, there's one more problem.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What is it?

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's about Alfa.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Until now.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I haven't heard from Vega.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm afraid.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They have a problem with Panji.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Professor.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can we...

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
...share the task?

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Me.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Professor Titan.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And Professor Agni.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We'll train the kids.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Meanwhile.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Professor Purwa.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think he's the right person.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
To bring Vega and his friends to Panji's house.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Look.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Panji left us.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Give it to Vega.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What if he wants it?

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He wants to hurt us.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where are we going?

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're right, Naya.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I know the way.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is it?

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Can we?

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If we become human again.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If we're hit by the sun.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's already late.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's only midnight.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So, it's 6 o'clock.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's right.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's 6 o'clock.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We're going to be chased.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I want to use the toilet first.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Ferita, go to sleep.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't.

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll try.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Ferita, sit down.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Where are you going?

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll try again.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ferita, be quiet.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Where are we going?

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm going to be chased.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't be chased.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's time.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's time.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My body...

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It hurts.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hang in there.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Looks like...

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Your wound isn't that bad.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You should rest.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And don't think too much.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All of this...

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Because of Serigala.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We can't stay silent.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We have to get rid of him.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If not...

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There will be other victims.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But, how can we defeat Serigala?

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Listen to me.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm a good hunter.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I know...

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How to defeat Serigala.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Serigala is afraid of fire.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And if we attack him...

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I burn him with eternal fire...

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Which comes from my soul...

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then, he will die.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're right.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We should gather men.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's burn him.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's go.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's burn him.

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're going to die, Panji.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's go down.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I want to try.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's burn him.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's go.

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I want to try.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I want to burn him.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Not yet.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want to join.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I want to join.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I want to burn him.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hey, you.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't push me.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm scared.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's burn him.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm tired.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Calm down.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's better to burn him than to stay alive.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's burn him.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I just remembered.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Serigala's arrow is so sharp.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Then, he will know where we are.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Really?

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's frozen.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you ready, Prita?

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't know.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Happy birthday.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you.

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Prita.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's frozen.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What should we do?

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll try again.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Wait.

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's hide first.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Come on.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There's no way to hide.

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There's someone down there.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Water.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Serigala

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Dad, I'm scared.

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Calm down.

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Serigala can be a good pet.

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
As long as you can touch his nose.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay?

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
My dad said,

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
if Serigala wants to be a pet,

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you have to touch his nose.

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't be ridiculous.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hold it.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Are you crazy?

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Just hold it.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't be ridiculous.

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What are you doing?

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What are you doing?

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Is that really Jinat?

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, it's Jinat.

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's scary.

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll try.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Lift one leg.

216
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's cold.

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Serigala,

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
now,

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you have to jump.

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll try.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Now, stay still.

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
One, two, three.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes, Jinat.

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's burn the monster.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's burn the monster.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's burn it.

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let's burn the monster.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Maji, come out.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Maji, come out.

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Maji, come out.

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What's going on?

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Maji, come out.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Serigala can be a good pet.

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You have to come out.

235
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Maji.

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Maji, come out.

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Professor Adebar.

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What do you want?

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I want you...

240
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
to come to my house.

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why do I have to go there?

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Until now,

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Vega and his friends...

244
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
haven't come back.

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And this is what worries me.

246
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You know how I am.

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm afraid...

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Vega and his friends will get into trouble there.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But why me, Professor?

250
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why not Megantara?

251
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Or Professor Yasmin? Or Professor Ragni?

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know that...

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I've never liked him.

254
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He's a weirdo.

255
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I know.

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But you're the only one who can go there.

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Because the other professors,

258
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Megantara, Yasmin, Ragni, and Titan,

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
they have other tasks.

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And one more thing.

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're the only one who can harm Paci.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What do you think?

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you ready?

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Whatever you say, Professor.

265
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll do it.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll count to three.

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you don't come out, I'll slam the door.

268
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Huh?

269
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Where are we?

270
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We've been waiting for so long.

271
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We've been waiting for so long.

273
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why didn't you come out?

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why didn't you come out?

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm scared.

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
One!

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Two!

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Three!

279
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let's go!

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Come on, Paci!

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There they are! Let's chase them!

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Don't run!

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Where do you think you're going?

284
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Let's go!

285
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Where do you think you're going?

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's burn them!

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't burn them!

288
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's a good idea.

289
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This is not a bad idea.

290
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is not a good idea.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's burn them!

292
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He's right.

293
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He's right.

294
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's just run away.

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I agree.

296
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's just run away.

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's just run away.

298
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's go.

299
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He knows about life.

300
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What if something happens to him?

301
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't live anymore.

302
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Let's just follow them.

303
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's just follow them.

304
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
How?

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Just follow them.

306
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Let's burn them!

307
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't listen to them.

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
People.

309
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't hesitate to attack those kids.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They're evil.

311
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They're evil.

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No.

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's a lie.

314
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's true.

315
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He's evil.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He's evil.

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You're all on his side.

318
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He's a liar.

319
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He's a traitor.

320
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He's a traitor.

321
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He's a traitor.

322
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes, people.

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't trust him.

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Kids.

325
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Who believes you?

326
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Come on, people.

327
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Let's attack them.

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Let's solve this problem.

329
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's burn them.

330
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's go.

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Be careful.

332
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's been 5 minutes.

333
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's been 5 years.

334
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't be stupid.

335
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This can be a truth book.

336
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Let's give it to them.

337
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's just talk to them.

338
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Let's go.

339
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's go.

340
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's run.

341
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Where are we going?

342
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's hide here.

343
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Let's go.

344
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's hide here.

345
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Luckily, this is a good place.

346
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If not, I won't be able to sleep.

347
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Don't be noisy.

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They'll be here soon.

349
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's hide here.

350
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Where should we hide?

351
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's hide under the leaves.

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Let's hide under the leaves.

353
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Let's hide under the leaves.

354
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They're here.

355
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm going to attack them.

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm going to kill them.

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Where are they?

358
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Where are they?

359
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Everyone.

360
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I told you.

361
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
They're evil.

362
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
They're evil.

363
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
They made us stupid.

364
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let's not waste our time.

365
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Let's go after them.

366
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm sure they're still here.

367
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Let's look for them somewhere else.

368
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's go.

369
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I don't know where they are.

370
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
If they're far away, let's hide here.

371
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They're here.

372
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They're over there.

373
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I think I heard their voices.

374
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Where are they?

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I think they're over there.

376
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Let's go after them.

377
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You're going to pay for this.

378
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Hold on.

379
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hold on.

380
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Let's go.

381
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Let's go.

382
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Where are you going?

383
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You can't go anywhere.

384
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Let's go.

385
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Hold on.

386
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go.

387
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You can't go anywhere this time.

388
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's go.

389
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Everyone.

390
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Listen to me.

391
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm Angkara.

392
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm a good slayer.

393
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And now...

394
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm going to burn this evil tribe...

395
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
with eternal fire.

396
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
As you know...

397
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
this eternal fire...

398
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
can't be extinguished by human magic.

399
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Let me go!

400
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Let go of that witch!

401
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Let go of that witch!

402
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Let go of that witch!

403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Let go of that witch!

404
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Let go of that witch!

405
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Don't touch me again!

406
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Let me go!

407
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And now...

408
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
it's time for me to burn her.

409
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Don't!

410
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Let me go!

411
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Let me go!

412
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Don't!

413
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Don't!

414
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Let me go!

415
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Let me go!

416
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Let me go!

417
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Feel this.

418
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Traitor.

419
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Now you can go.

420
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Let me see...

421
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
what you've done.

422
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Thank you, good slayer.

423
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Let's go home.

424
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
To be continued...

425
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And now for the second task.

426
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Which is to bring you to Alpha.

427
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I will take you to the Dark Abyss...

428
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
so you can be destroyed by him.

429
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Let us go!

430
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
What are you doing?

431
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Take that!

432
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Hurry up!

433
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Attack him!

434
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Go!

435
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
One, two, three!

436
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Attack him!

437
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Attack him!

438
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Attack him!

439
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
One, two, three!

440
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Attack him!

441
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Attack him!

442
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Serigala!

443
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Defend him!

444
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Where should we go?

445
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Where?

446
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'll go there.

447
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Pavanam!

448
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Sir!

449
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Let me try.

450
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Don't cut the water!

451
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Serigala!

452
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let me try.

453
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Let me try.

454
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Let me go!

455
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let me go!

456
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Let me go!

457
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
This is not funny.

458
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Where are they?

459
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
They're fighting!

460
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Wait for me!

461
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
We're going to die!

462
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Just like what Professor Akari said!

463
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Let me go!

464
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
We're going to die!

465
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Let me go!

466
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Just like what Professor Akari said.

467
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This is eternal fire.

468
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We're going to die.

469
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
What should we do?

470
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Go!

471
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Defend him!

472
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Go back to that place.

473
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Make sure he's safe.

474
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And bring his body here.

475
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yes.

476
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
He can use teleportation.

477
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
He can go from there.

478
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
That's impossible.

479
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
He can't talk.

480
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You're right.

481
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He has to move.

482
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So, we have to turn him into Mr. Panji.

483
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But how?

484
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes.

485
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
He's not a human anymore.

486
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If he's exposed to the sun, we have to steal the sun.

487
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Steal the sun?

488
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That's impossible.

489
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
If he's exposed to the sun, what should we do?

490
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Whatever it is, we have to try.

491
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Let's try to find him.

492
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What should we do?

493
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
He's too slow.

494
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He's going to turn into me.

495
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I know.

496
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I know what to do.

497
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Let's find him.

498
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Putri Bintang!

499
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Help me!

500
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm lost!

501
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Putri Bintang!

502
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Putri Bintang!

503
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Putri Bintang!

504
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Alva?

505
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Alva, Plita.

506
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
How are you?

507
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Hi, sister!

508
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
There's fire!

509
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You're making a fire?

510
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That's so exciting!

511
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's not a fire!

512
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's a serigala!

513
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Serigala is Mr. Panji!

514
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
He's a human!

515
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh my God!

516
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He's going to be burned!

517
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I want to ask you for a favor.

518
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Can you make the sun appear?

519
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
If there's a sun, he'll turn into a human.

520
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Can you make the sun appear?

521
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But don't take too long!

522
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It's still hot!

523
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm so sorry, guys.

524
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I can't help you.

525
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't know the sun.

526
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
He's a human.

527
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't know the sun.

528
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't know the sun.

529
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't know the sun.

530
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't know the sun.

531
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
He appears in the morning.

532
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I appear at night.

533
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh no!

534
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I can't do it!

535
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Where is it?

536
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Where is it?

537
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Oh, I know!

538
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I can call the stars and the moon...

539
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to hide.

540
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So, the morning will come faster.

541
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay, hurry up!

542
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Hurry up!

543
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay.

544
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Friends of the stars and the moon,

545
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
let's hide.

546
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So, the morning will come faster.

547
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes, it's morning!

548
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yes, it's morning!

549
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes, it's morning!

550
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Sir!

551
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You have to go there.

552
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You have to use your right hand.

553
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Right hand!

554
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Hurry up!

555
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Hurry up!

556
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Hurry up!

557
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What's the result, Angkar?

558
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I can't feel anything...

559
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
if I don't see Angkar and his friends there.

560
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And they make me feel nervous.

561
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm so nervous.

562
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Angkar!

563
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Why are you quiet?

564
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Angkar!

565
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Answer me!

566
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Sir.

567
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
This time,

568
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
the magic has worked, sir.

569
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I've managed to provoke...

570
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
all the villagers to burn all of that, sir.

571
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And now, all of that...

572
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
has become...

573
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
grilled meat, sir.

574
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You'll see for yourself when he's dead.

575
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
No, sir.

576
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But...

577
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
he can't get away.

578
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Because I've burned him with eternal fire.

579
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And eternal fire can't be extinguished, sir.

580
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Idiot!

581
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Now, go back to your place.

582
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Make sure you're safe.

583
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And bring his body here.

584
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes, sir.

585
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Alright, sir.

586
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Wait here.

587
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Angkar

588
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Angkar

589
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Angkar

590
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Sir.

591
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Sir.

592
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Sir.

593
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Sir.

594
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Sir.

595
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Why are they here?

596
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What's the story?

597
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The story...

598
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
is very sad.

599
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
In the past,

600
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I was the son of the 8th Prince.

601
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The 8th Prince...

602
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
taught me...

603
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
to be a cruel and evil ruler...

604
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
who doesn't harm anyone...

605
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
without my permission.

606
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Angkar

607
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Angkar

608
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Hurry up.

609
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Kill him.

610
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Angkar

611
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Good.

612
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Meanwhile,

613
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I have two friends.

614
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
They are your parents.

615
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Gama and Aquila.

616
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Actually,

617
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
they often advised me...

618
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
to leave the 8th Prince.

619
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But I don't want to.

620
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Because I want to be strong.

621
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
One day,

622
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I was assigned by the 8th Prince.

623
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But I failed.

624
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
When he found out about my failure,

625
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
the 8th Prince was very angry.

626
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
He wanted to kill me.

627
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
He wanted to kill me.

628
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But suddenly,

629
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
someone threw a smoke bomb...

630
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and killed me.

631
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That person is you.

632
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
In the end, I decided...

633
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
to leave the 8th Prince.

634
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But the 8th Prince didn't leave him alone.

635
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
He was very cruel.

636
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
He was very angry with Gama.

637
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And he insisted...

638
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
that he must destroy Gama and Aquila.

639
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Do it!

640
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
To be continued...

641
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
To be continued...

642
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
To be continued...

643
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
To be continued...

644
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Why?

645
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Only my parents were killed.

646
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Why not me?

647
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You mean,

648
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
he didn't kill you and let you live?

649
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
For that matter,

650
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
no one knows.

651
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But one thing is clear.

652
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
When the 8th Prince attacked you,

653
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
a power came out of you...

654
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and made the 8th Prince furious.

655
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
When he wanted to attack you again,

656
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
he realized...

657
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
that the 8th Prince...

658
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
realized...

659
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that he had lost all his power.

660
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
To be continued...

661
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
To be continued...

662
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It can't be!

663
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I can't lose my power!

664
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Then,

665
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
why did the 8th Prince faint...

666
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
when he attacked me?

667
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
According to Aldebaran,

668
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
that was my love mantra.

669
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
That mantra was created by your parents.

670
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Do you know Prince Aldebaran?

671
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yes.

672
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Back then,

673
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
he was the teacher of the 5 Earthlings in Sihir.

674
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
When I was still in school.

675
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
In Sihir School.

676
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Now, he's a school principal.

677
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Oh.

678
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So, you're a Sihir student.

679
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Aldebaran is half my age.

680
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So, that means...

681
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
you look really old.

682
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You scared me.

683
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Do you still want to hear the story?

684
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Of course.

685
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Of course I do.

686
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Don't worry.

687
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
The 8th Prince has lost all his power.

688
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
He's trying to find a way...

689
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
to regain all his power.

690
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
He's looking for all kinds of resources.

691
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Finally, he realizes...

692
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
that there's a way...

693
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
to regain all his power.

694
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That is with blood,

695
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
tears,

696
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and your sweat, Alva.

697
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Then, why are my parents here?

698
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Gamma, I'm lost.

699
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm lost.

700
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Gamma.

701
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Gamma, I'm lost.

702
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Panji.

703
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The chain of life.

704
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Put it on me.

705
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's in your closet.

706
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
No.

707
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The chain of life...

708
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
should be able to heal them.

709
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But because their wounds are so bad,

710
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
they can't be healed, Alva.

711
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
They can only sleep...

712
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and can't wake up again.

713
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
This chain of life...

714
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
only supports their lives.

715
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
As far as I know, they can only get married.

716
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So, the way my parents talk...

717
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
is just a dream.

718
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
You said they appeared in your dream?

719
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Yes.

720
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
No wonder.

721
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
They told me...

722
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
to pray and cheer up.

723
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Alva.

724
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
If Gamma and I said they appeared in your dream,

725
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
please ask them.

726
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Ask them what I should do...

727
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
to wake them up.

728
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Okay.

729
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'll tell them.

730
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Okay.

731
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Okay.

732
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I'll go now.

733
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I still have unfinished business.

734
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Sir, where are you going?

735
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I want to kill Angkara.

736
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm confused with him.

737
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Why is he attacking me?

738
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We've met before.

739
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Don't meet him.

740
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
He's the son of the 8th Prince.

741
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Angkara is the son of the 8th Prince?

742
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yes.

743
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They're getting stronger...

744
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
because they've got...

745
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
my tears, sweat, and blood.

746
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Angkara is the son of the 8th Prince.

747
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm sure the ant has been burned to ashes.

748
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But...

749
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
what should I bring home for the 8th Prince?

750
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
5 years later

751
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
This is for Kayu.

752
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
The 8th Prince will never be able to stop him.

753
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
5 years later

754
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Look, Sir.

755
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
This is his body.

756
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
He has become worse.

757
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I'm dead.

758
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
How do you know that's not Panji's body?

759
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm going there.

760
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I won't let you do anything to Panji.

761
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
5 years later

762
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Finally, I won.

763
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Shut up!

764
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Who told you to do that?

765
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I'm sorry, Sir.

766
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
5 years later

767
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Guys, Adi is coming.

768
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Don't be scared.

769
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
That's Professor Ankara.

770
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
As soon as the door is opened,

771
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
we'll attack Professor Ankara with the TV.

772
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Okay?

773
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Okay.

774
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Just go in.

775
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Don't lock the door.

776
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
TV!

777
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Professor Burua?

778
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Professor Burua?

779
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
What's going on?

780
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm sorry, Professor Burua.

781
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Shut up, Sir!

782
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Shut up, all of you!

783
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Let's go.

784
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
No one can go back.

785
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Shut up, all of you!

786
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Professor Burua.

787
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Why are you here, Sir?

788
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Shut up!

789
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
5 years later

790
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What's going on?

791
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Panji.

792
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
This must be you.

793
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You ordered the kids to attack me.

794
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Right?

795
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Don't you dare accuse me.

796
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
5 years later

797
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Professor Burua.

798
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm sorry.

799
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
We didn't mean to.

800
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
We thought you were Professor Ankara.

801
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yes, Sir.

802
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
We thought you were Professor Ankara.

803
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So, we avoided it.

804
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yes, Sir.

805
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
We avoided it.

806
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Professor Burua.

807
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
What are you doing here?

808
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I was ordered by Professor Aldebaran...

809
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
to come here...

810
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and pick all of you up...

811
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
to go back to school.

812
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
What?

813
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So, Professor Burua came here to pick us up?

814
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Yes.

815
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Sir.

816
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What should I do?

817
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Should I stay here and take care of you...

818
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
or should I go with Professor Burua?

819
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We'll send Aldebaran to the fire prison.

820
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And...

821
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I'll take you as the head of the magic school.

822
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We can do it.

823
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I order you...

824
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
to pack your things...

825
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and come with me to the magic school.

826
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

827
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I don't want to.

828
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I don't want to go home.

829
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Alva.

830
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Let me remind you.

831
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You're still a student of the magic school.

832
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I'm your teacher.

833
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And I'm responsible for your safety.

834
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So, you have to come with me.

835
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Toleng.

836
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Vega.

837
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Belita.

838
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Ray.

839
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Let's go.

840
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
We don't want to.

841
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I don't want to go home.

842
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I want to stay here.

843
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
We don't want to.

844
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I don't want to.

845
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yes, sir.

846
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It's like eating...

847
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
three meals a day.

848
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It's not good, sir.

849
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Sir.

850
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We still have important things to do.

851
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What are you doing?

852
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Panji.

853
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I know...

854
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
this must be you.

855
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You told the kids to stay here.

856
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You brainwashed them.

857
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Right?

858
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
No, sir.

859
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So, I was wrong?

860
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I told you...

861
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
not to accuse them.

862
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Right?

863
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's clear now.

864
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
They chose me...

865
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
over you.

866
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
We still have important things to do.

867
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You'll see.

868
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Alva.

869
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Let's go home.

870
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
No.

871
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Let's go.

872
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
No, sir.

873
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I don't want to go home.

874
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Shut up. You have to come with me.

875
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Let's go.

876
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
No, sir.

877
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I don't want to go home.

878
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Enough.

879
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Let Alva go.

880
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Let them go home.

881
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm warning you.

882
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Don't get involved in my business.

883
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Alva.

884
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Let's go home.

885
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Where are the other kids?

886
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Let's go home.

887
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Sir, don't go there.

888
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yes, sir.

889
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't want to go home with you.

890
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I want to stay here with Panji.

891
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm sorry, sir.

892
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I still have things to do here.

893
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Alright.

894
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
If that's what you want.

895
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Alva.

896
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'll let you stay here.

897
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But on one condition.

898
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
What is it, sir?

899
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You have to fight me.

900
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
If you lose.

901
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You and the others have to come with me to Sihir's school.

902
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But if you refuse.

903
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I'll let you stay here.

904
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
With the others.

905
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I don't want to go home.

906
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't want to go home.

907
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I don't want to go home.

908
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I don't want to go home.

909
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I don't want to go home.

910
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
How is it?

911
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
If you...

912
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Don't want to fight me.

913
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I'll assume that you give up.

914
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And it means that you fail.

915
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And due to that.

916
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You and the others have to come with me.

917
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Come on kids, let's go home.

918
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Dad.

919
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I want to fight.

920
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh my God.

921
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You're like this.

922
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You're always looking for trouble.

923
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Panji is not dead.

924
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Panji is dead, sir.

925
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So, what's our next plan?

926
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'll move on to the second list.

927
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
But before that.

928
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I want to give you a present, Angkara.

929
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Because you have successfully completed the mission perfectly.

930
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
What do you want, Angkara?

931
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'll grant it.

932
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I want to be the head of the magic school, sir.

933
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
What a coincidence, Angkara.

934
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
That's also on my mind.

935
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Then.

936
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
We'll send Aldebaran to the fire prison.

937
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And.

938
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'll promote you as the head of the magic school, Angkara.

939
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Thank you, sir.

940
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Thank you.

941
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Finally.

942
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
My chance to get rid of Aldebaran as the head of the magic school has come.

943
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
As the head of the magic school.

944
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I want to make the last vote.

945
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
To decide who deserves to be the head of the magic school.

946
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Please.

947
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
To be continued...

948
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
To be continued...

949
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
For the time being.

950
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
For Professor Aldebaran and Professor Angkara.

951
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's unanimous.

952
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
There's only one vote left.

953
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Please, Professor Agni.

954
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I will win.

955
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Because Agni will choose me.

956
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Professor Agni chooses.

957
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Professor Aldebaran.

958
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Long live Professor Aldebaran.

959
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Why did you choose Aldebaran?

960
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Because you're my future wife.

961
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Angkara.

962
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
We do have a close relationship.

963
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And the election of the head of the school.

964
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Has nothing to do with our relationship.

965
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm sure.

966
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Aldebaran can be a good head of the school.

967
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So, you mean...

968
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I'm not good?

969
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
No.

970
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
That's not what I mean.

971
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I'm disappointed in you.

972
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Finish him!

973
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Sir!

974
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
To be continued...

975
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
One.

976
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Two.

977
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Three.

978
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Sir!

979
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Finish him!

980
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Sir!

981
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I think this is just a small competition.

982
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Looks like...

983
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
No one supports me.

984
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
May I shake your hand...

985
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
For my first round victory.

986
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
We're a safe team.

987
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
We don't want to be a traitor.

988
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Yes.

989
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
We're a team.

990
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I don't want to be a traitor.

991
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
What's that?

992
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yes.

993
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Let's just vote. We're at risk.

994
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yes.

995
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Good morning, kids.

996
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Good morning, sir.

997
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Maybe you're all wondering...

998
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
About the writing in front of you.

999
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Here's the thing.

1000
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Our school will have a selection.

1001
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Who among you...

1002
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Has the ability and is ready to fight?

1003
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
The chosen one...

1004
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Will be a part of...

1005
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Laskar Aldebaran.

1006
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
The mission of Laskar Aldebaran...

1007
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Is, first...

1008
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You're ready to serve the school.

1009
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And second...

1010
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
You're ready to destroy...

1011
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Pangeran Kegelapan.

1012
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Pangeran Kegelapan?

1013
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Yes.

1014
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
That's right.

1015
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
So, we can't just choose a kid...

1016
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
To be a part of the team.

1017
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
We have to select him correctly.

1018
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's right, kids.

1019
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
What Professor Agni said.

1020
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That's right.

1021
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
This is my chance to be a champion.

1022
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I don't have Alpha anymore.

1023
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I'm joining the army.

1024
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Me too.

1025
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Mami, are you sure you want to join?

1026
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
When we fought the raptors, you ran away.

1027
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
We'll see.

1028
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I'm going to fight Pangeran Kegelapan.

1029
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
We've arrived at Sekolah Sihir, sir.

1030
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Okay, kids.

1031
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Before we start the activity.

1032
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Let's sing the song...

1033
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Mars Sekolah Sihir.

1034
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Kids.

1035
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Don't forget the style I taught you.

1036
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Yes, sir.

1037
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Kids.

1038
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Since this is the song of Mars.

1039
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
You have to sing it with spirit.

1040
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yes, sir.

1041
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Good.

1042
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Let's start on three.

1043
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
One.

1044
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Two.

1045
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Three.

1046
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Amkara.

1047
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
If you're the head of the school here.

1048
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Change the song.

1049
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
They all have to be my followers.

1050
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yes, sir.

1051
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I'll make this school the second head of the school.

1052
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You'll see, Agni.

1053
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
You'll know...

1054
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I'll make this school the second head of the school.

1055
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Try to imitate it.

1056
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Do it with a smile.

1057
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
How is this?

1058
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
How can you beat Pangeran Kegelapan?

1059
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You lost to the raptors.

1060
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Whose voice is that?

1061
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
That's his voice.

1062
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That's none of your business.

1063
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Don't give up.

1064
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Chase your dreams.

1065
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Go, go, go.

1066
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Achieve all your dreams.

1067
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Go, go, go.

1068
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Never stop.

1069
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Go, go, go.

1070
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Fight with your heart.

1071
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Go, go, go.

1072
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Be proud of yourself.

1073
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Go, go, go.

1074
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Let's dream.

1075
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Go, go, go.

1076
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
We'll make it.
