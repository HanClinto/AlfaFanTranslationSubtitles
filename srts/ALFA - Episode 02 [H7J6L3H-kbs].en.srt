6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Show your spirit, get your friends ready

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Be brave, don't give up

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 We can do it

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 What are you doing to my sister?

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I'm here to save you

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 You have obtained the power of the five

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 No one can stop you

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Good afternoon, kids

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Wow, I can do this with Mureh

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Wow, Mureh is so cool

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Don't you dare to enter that room

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Alpha enters the secret room and meets the third force

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 What we fear will happen

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 What we fear will happen

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 What's going on?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 What's going on?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 What's going on?

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Kids, calm down

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 What's going on?

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 There's a monster that successfully entered

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Is it a kid monster?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Yes, ma'am

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Shh, don't make noise

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 You better stay here and don't leave before I order you

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Do you understand?

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Yes, ma'am

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Come on

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Have you seen Vega?

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Vega?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Where's Vega?

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Vega, smart boy, where are you?

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I was with Vega and he said he wanted to go to the bathroom

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He's in the bathroom

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Don't, sir

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 We can't go out of the bathroom together because it's not safe

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 But he's our friend

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 What if he's in danger?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 You're brave

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 But it's dangerous

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Enough

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Sir, wait

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 It's a monster, sir

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Bro!

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Get out!

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Get out!

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Get out!

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Get out!

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Get out!

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Get out!

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Get out!

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Get out!

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Get out!

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Get out!

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Get out!

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Get out!

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Get out!

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Get out!

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Get out!

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Get out!

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Get out!

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Get out!

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Get out!

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Get out!

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Get out!

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Get out!

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 It's huge

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I hate monsters

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I'm so scared

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I'm scared

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Sir!

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Sir!

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Sir!

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Sir!

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Sir!

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Sir!

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Sir!

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Sir!

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Sir!

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 He's coming!

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Let's go!

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Let's go!

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Let's go!

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 You're mine!

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Where are we going?

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 I don't know

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Help!

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Let's go!

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Hurry up!

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Hurry up!

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Hurry up!

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Help!

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Rika!

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Run!

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Run!

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Run!

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Run!

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Show it to him!

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 No!

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 You're dead!

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Let the kid go!

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Here!

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 No!

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Argo!

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 What's that?

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's a...

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 No!

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 No!

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 No!

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I am...

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Argo!

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Anadol!

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 What's that?

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 No!

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 No!

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I am...

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Argo!

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Lolipop!

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 The teeth can kill, but you can kill it through the teeth!

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Argo!

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Concentrate and use your Lolipop!

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Yes!

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Argo!

136
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I am...

137
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Argo!

138
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 No!

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 No!

140
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 No!

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 No!

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 No!

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 No!

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 No!

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 No!

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 No!

147
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I am...

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Argo!

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 No!

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Argo!

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 No!

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 No!

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 No!

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Argo!

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 No!

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 No!

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 No!

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 No!

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 No!

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 No!

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 No!

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 No!

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 No!

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 No!

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 No!

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 No!

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 No!

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Alva!

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Thank you, Alva.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 We are not wrong anymore.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Only you can do this.

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Why me, Professor?

173
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Alva, promise me.

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 You will never tell anyone about what happened just now.

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Never tell anyone that you have defeated the monster.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Now, go back to the lab.

177
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Let your friends handle this.

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 The monster?

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 How?

180
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Barga is a very strong monster.

181
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 He is a monster that can be defeated by a single blow.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 He is the hand of the 8th Prince.

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 The only one who can defeat him is the 8th Prince and a chosen child.

184
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Who is he?

185
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Alva.

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 He is the chosen child.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 The daughter of Gamma and Aqilla.

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 He will be our savior.

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 That is why we must always protect him.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 With all our abilities.

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 So that when the time comes, Alva can fight the 8th Prince.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Agni, please keep this a secret.

193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Don't let anyone know that the chosen child is in this school.

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 If anyone finds out,

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 the 8th Prince will know what we are planning.

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Yes, sir.

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 We are ready to be sworn.

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I swear.

199
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 My monster!

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Where is my monster?

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Where is my monster?

202
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Where is my monster?

203
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Calm down, Ray.

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 There is no monster here.

205
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Oh, right.

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I can go to the bedroom.

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 We were fighting a monster, right?

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Yes.

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 You fainted, right?

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Then?

211
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Then where is my monster now?

212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Who is defeating it?

213
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Oh, right.

214
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Hey, Pegah.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Don't be a coward when you go in.

216
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I am so curious.

217
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 I woke up and found it in the bedroom.

218
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 You fainted, right?

219
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Then the teachers and Professor Aldebaran came.

220
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Professor Aldebaran defeated the monster, right?

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Yes, that's right.

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I am the monster.

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Professor Aldebaran was defeated.

224
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I am the monster.

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 As long as Professor Aldebaran is here, we are safe.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 That's right.

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Why am I here?

228
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Thank God.

229
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 You both are awake.

230
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Professor Ali.

231
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Where is the monster?

232
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Calm down, Professor Purwa.

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 The monster has been defeated.

234
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 That means the 8th prince is here.

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Because only he can defeat it.

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Calm down, Professor Purwa.

237
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 The 8th prince is not here.

238
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 But the chosen one has succeeded in defeating him.

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Who is he?

240
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I am sorry.

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 But I have promised not to tell anyone.

242
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Clearly, the chosen one is among our students here.

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The 8th Prince

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Alva?

245
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Alva?

246
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Alva?

247
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Alva?

248
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Alva?

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Alva?

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Alva, you have to protect the Stone of Eternity in this school.

251
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 What is the Stone of Eternity?

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 The Stone of Eternity is a very strong stone.

253
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 The stone cannot fall into the wrong hands.

254
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 You have to protect the stone.

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But how do I protect it?

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Protect it with your heart, Alva.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 How do you know this school?

258
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And you know my name?

259
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Who are you?

260
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 One day you will know who we really are.

261
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The Stone of Eternity

262
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Hey!

263
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Who are you?

264
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 What is it?

265
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I had a weird dream.

266
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 What dream?

267
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 This.

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 What is that?

269
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 The Stone of Eternity

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 What?

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I was visited by someone.

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And that person is really nice.

273
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I can feel that they love me.

274
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And the weirdest thing is,

275
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 they told me to protect the Stone of Eternity in this school.

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 The Stone of Eternity?

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 What is that?

278
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I just heard it.

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Maybe it's just a dream.

280
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I'm going to sleep.

281
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I'm sleepy.

282
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Wait!

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 The dream is real.

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 It's real.

285
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The person in the dream must be serious.

286
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Who is the person in your dream?

287
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I don't know. I don't know him.

288
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Let's do this.

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Tomorrow we ask the teacher.

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Maybe he knows.

291
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The person in your dream must be serious.

292
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Where is he?

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 There he is.

294
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Oh, yeah.

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Let's go.

296
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Tentara.

297
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 What is the Stone of Eternity?

298
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 The Stone of Eternity

299
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 is the Stone that is protected by the Three-Headed Dragon.

300
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So, the Stone of Eternity really exists?

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Alva.

302
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 You...

303
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 How do you know the Stone of Eternity?

304
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 You're just in the first grade.

305
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 You don't know that yet.

306
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Come on.

307
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Over there.

308
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I'm busy cooking for the Three-Headed Dragon.

309
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 So, the Three-Headed Dragon...

310
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 likes Rendang, Gudeg, and Salted Fish.

311
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 This.

312
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 This is my food.

313
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I love eating Gudeg, Salted Fish, and Rendang.

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 I'm hungry.

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Don't disturb me.

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Come on.

317
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Let's go.

318
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 This is the mouth.

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 This is the mouth.

320
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 There's a stone behind the dragon.

321
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And the dragon guards the stone.

322
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 What's with the stone?

323
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Why is it guarded?

324
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I don't know.

325
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 To be continued...

326
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 To be continued...

327
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 To be continued...

328
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 To be continued...

329
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 To be continued...

330
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 To be continued...

331
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 To be continued...

332
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 To be continued...

333
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 To be continued...

334
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Don't you dare to eat or do anything...

335
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 during my class time.

336
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 You all know that...

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 the students have entered our school.

338
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And for that, there's a new rule that will be applied.

339
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 After 8 PM,

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 all students are forbidden to leave the classroom.

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And if anyone steps,

342
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 the perpetrator will be punished.

343
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And one classroom will be punished.

344
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Do you understand?

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Yes, sir.

346
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Good.

347
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Now, I will teach a new mantra...

348
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 that you can use to take other things.

349
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Pay attention.

350
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Nafatang Buku.

351
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Sambung.

352
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Now,

353
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 focus.

354
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And you all try it.

355
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Now, start.

356
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Nafatang Buku.

357
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Nafatang Buku.

358
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Nafatang Buku.

359
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Nafatang Buku.

360
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Nafatang Buku.

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Nafatang Buku.

362
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Nafatang Buku.

363
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

364
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 That's so cool.

365
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Nafatang Buku.

366
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

367
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Nafatang Buku.

368
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

369
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

370
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

371
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

372
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

373
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

374
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

375
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 (The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

376
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Alva.

377
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 You are to clean this page.

378
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 How long do you need?

379
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Three hours, sir.

380
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 To live in this world.

381
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 It's not as easy as living in the real world.

382
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 You have three minutes...

383
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 to clean this page.

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And you have to finish it.

385
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Do you understand?

386
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Three minutes?

387
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Sir.

388
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I think, sir...

389
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 for Alva's size...

390
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 the punishment is too heavy.

391
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 This is still in my class.

392
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 So I have the right to decide...

393
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 anything for the students' education.

394
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I forgot, sir.

395
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 If so, please continue.

396
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Thank you.

397
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Alva.

398
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Do as I say.

399
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 If you can't finish it...

400
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 your punishment will be heavier.

401
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 (Alva's punishment is heavier.)

402
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Three.

403
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Two minutes and 59 seconds.

404
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Two minutes and 58 seconds.

405
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 A box of fruit.

406
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 There's a ripe fruit.

407
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I'm hungry.

408
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I'll try it.

409
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 It must be delicious.

410
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Get the fruit.

411
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Get the fruit.

412
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 I've learned the mantra, "Mindai Menda".

413
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 It's a good idea.

414
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I can use the mantra for this punishment.

415
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Let's try.

416
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Get the small piece of paper.

417
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Get the paper.

418
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Get the paper.

419
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Get the paper.

420
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Get the paper.

421
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I did it!

422
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 I've finished it all!

423
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

424
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

425
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

426
00:29:46,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

427
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

428
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

429
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

430
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

431
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 (The punishment is heavier.)

432
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 You have to answer my question.

433
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Who is the chosen one?

434
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 I can't answer, Prof.

435
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Because my mouth has been sworn by the mantra to tell anyone.

436
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 I see.

437
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Now, you have to do what I ask you to do.

438
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Because you know who the chosen one is.

439
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 You have to make the chosen one...

440
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 ...enter the secret room...

441
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 ...and take the stone to the body.

442
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Yes, Prof.

443
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 One more thing.

444
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 You have to lead the chosen one to take the stone to the body.

445
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Alva, we want to help you with the punishment.

446
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Yes.

447
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Do we still need to work?

448
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 No, the punishment is over.

449
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Why is it so fast?

450
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Yes, how come?

451
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Alva, come to my room now.

452
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 What's wrong with me?

453
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 You're smart.

454
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 You know everything.

455
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 But I don't know everything.

456
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 I'm going to find out.

457
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Alva, I'm calling you because you have to do something for me.

458
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Tonight.

459
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Before the sun rises, you have to go back to the secret room...

460
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 ...and take the stone to the body for me.

461
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Isn't that forbidden?

462
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I'm not going to do it.

463
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 I'm not going to do it.

464
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I'm not going to do it.

465
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I'm not going to do it.

466
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Alva, this school is in danger.

467
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And only the stone of eternity can save us all.

468
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 But why should I take the stone?

469
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Because you have defeated the monster.

470
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 It will come back to life when the sun rises.

471
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 But how, ma'am?

472
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 There's a third head dragon there.

473
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And that dragon is very strong.

474
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I will tell you about the third head dragon.

475
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 300 years ago, there lived three great and brave dragon warriors.

476
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 They were very loyal to their country.

477
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 They fed their livestock.

478
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

479
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And the man who was responsible for the dragon's head...

480
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 ...was killed by the dragon itself.

481
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And the dragon was left alone.

482
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Until one day, they were faced by the dark dragon's army.

483
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 The dark dragon's army was defeated by the dragon's head.

484
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 But the dragon's head was cut off.

485
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And the dragon was left alone.

486
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

487
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And the dragon was left alone.

488
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And the dragon was left alone.

489
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

490
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And the dragon was left alone.

491
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

492
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 And the dragon was left alone.

493
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 [music]

494
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And the third dragon was defeated.

495
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 [music]

496
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Ashifa and Imran were killed.

497
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 The three dragons were very sad because they lost their parents.

498
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 [music]

499
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 The three dragons' tears shed light on the world.

500
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 This made the three dragons unite.

501
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Senua became the head of the three great dragons.

502
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 [music]

503
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 So the three dragons can fight if we give them the same food as their parents.

504
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 I saw the army cooking three different foods.

505
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Is that right for the three dragons?

506
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 That's right, Alva.

507
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 I've told you everything.

508
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Now it's up to you.

509
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Only you can take the Stone of Eternity and save all our lives.

510
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 [music]

511
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000

512
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 [music]

513
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 [music]

514
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 [music]

515
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 [music]

516
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 It's scary when it's narrow.

517
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 [music]

518
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Now we have to make three different foods.

519
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 The three dragons' favorite foods are rendang, kuduk, and nasinan.

520
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 The dragons don't need us.

521
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 We will help the eternity.

522
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 So now we have to go to the kitchen.

523
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 That's right. Let's go.

524
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 [music]

525
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Professor!

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 [music]

527
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Who's there?

528
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 [music]

529
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Come out!

530
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 [music]

531
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 I said come out or I'll have to use magic.

532
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 [music]

533
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 One.

534
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 [music]

535
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Two.

536
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 [music]

537
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 Three.

538
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 [music]

539
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 I want to talk to you.

540
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Can you come out?

541
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 [music]

542
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Come.

543
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 [music]

544
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Oh my.

545
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Don't wait. Let's just take off the mask.

546
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 [sigh]

547
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Let's talk later.

548
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 Now let's go to the kitchen to cook.

549
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Yes.

550
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Be careful.

551
00:40:43,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 [music]

552
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 It's time.

553
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Come out.

554
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 [music]

555
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 It's like someone is cooking.

556
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 [music]

557
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Who's inside?

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:52,000

559
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000

563
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 It's heavy.

00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 [music]

565
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Be careful.

 Ray, Vega.

569
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 If the third-world soldiers don't like these foods and get more and more fierce,

570
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 you have to defend yourselves.

571
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Let me face it.

572
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000

573
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Be careful. It can drown the cloud.

581
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 Ray, where are you going?

582
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Ray, his face is blue.

583
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Ray, he's poisoned.

00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000

00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 Ray, his face is blue.

616
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Ray, he's poisoned.

617
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Poison gas can kill if there is no supply in two hours.

 Where are we?

620
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 We have to take him to the clinic.

621
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 No, no, no.

622
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 You just continue your task.

623
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 You have to take the stone to the shrine before the sun sets.

624
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 Let me take care of it, Ray.

625
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 But...

626
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 It's okay.

632
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 You have to succeed.

634
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 I'm afraid this stone is not ready yet.

 [music]

636
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 You'd better go to the shrine now.

 [scream]

638
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 They are not just a bunch of angsa.

639
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 But they are the daughter of an angsa.

640
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 [music]

641
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 Alpha, why did you ask for the stone?

642
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Professor Agni asked for it, Professor.

643
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 Because this school is in danger.

644
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 Only that stone can save this school.

645
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 Alpha must be released.

646
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Three days until the lunar month.

647
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 And if in the lunar month, the dark lord gets the stone of peace.

648
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 He will get unlimited power.

649
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 And will destroy this world.

650
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000

651
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to chase your friends.

652
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 Run, jump, climb, climb the stars.

653
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 Be brave, don't give up.

654
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes.

655
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams.

656
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Go, go, go, never stop.

657
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart.

658
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:21,460
 Go, Go, Go. make yourself proud, Go, Go, Go. let's dream, Go, Go, Go, we will.
