What are you doing to my sister?

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm here to save you

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You have obtained the power of the five

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No one can stop you

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Good afternoon, kids

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wow, I can do this with Mureh

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Wow, Mureh is so cool

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't you dare to enter that room

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alpha enters the secret room and meets the third force

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What we fear will happen

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's going on?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Kids, calm down

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's going on?

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There's a monster that successfully entered

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Is it a kid monster?

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, ma'am

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Shh, don't make noise

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You better stay here and don't leave before I order you

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do you understand?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes, ma'am

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Come on

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Have you seen Vega?

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Vega?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Where's Vega?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Vega, smart boy, where are you?

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was with Vega and he said he wanted to go to the bathroom

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He's in the bathroom

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't, sir

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We can't go out of the bathroom together because it's not safe

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But he's our friend

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What if he's in danger?

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're brave

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But it's dangerous

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Enough

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sir, wait

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's a monster, sir

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Bro!

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Get out!

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's huge

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I hate monsters

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm so scared

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm scared

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sir!

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He's coming!

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go!

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're mine!

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Where are we going?

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Help!

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's go!

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hurry up!

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Help!

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Rika!

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Run!

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Show it to him!

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No!

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're dead!

72
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let the kid go!

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Here!

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No!

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Argo!

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's that?

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a...

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No!

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am...

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Argo!

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Anadol!

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What's that?

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No!

84
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I am...

85
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Argo!

86
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Lolipop!

87
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The teeth can kill, but you can kill it through the teeth!

88
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Argo!

89
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Concentrate and use your Lolipop!

90
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes!

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Argo!

92
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I am...

93
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Argo!

94
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No!

95
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I am...

96
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Argo!

97
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No!

98
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Argo!

99
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No!

100
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Argo!

101
00:11:34,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No!

102
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Alfa!

103
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thank you, Alfa.

104
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We are not wrong anymore.

105
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Only you can do this.

106
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why me, Professor?

107
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Alfa, promise me.

108
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You will never tell anyone about what happened just now.

109
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Never tell anyone that you have defeated the monster.

110
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now, go back to the lab.

111
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let your friends handle this.

112
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The monster?

113
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
How?

114
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Barga is a very strong monster.

115
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He is a monster that can be defeated by a single blow.

116
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He is the hand of the 8th Prince.

117
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The only one who can defeat him is the 8th Prince and a chosen child.

118
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Who is he?

119
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Alfa.

120
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He is the chosen child.

121
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The daughter of Gamma and Aqilla.

122
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He will be our savior.

123
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That is why we must always protect him.

124
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
With all our abilities.

125
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So that when the time comes, Alfa can fight the 8th Prince.

126
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Agni, please keep this a secret.

127
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't let anyone know that the chosen child is in this school.

128
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If anyone finds out,

129
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
the 8th Prince will know what we are planning.

130
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes, sir.

131
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We are ready to be sworn.

132
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I swear.

133
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
My monster!

134
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Where is my monster?

135
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Calm down, Ray.

136
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There is no monster here.

137
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, right.

138
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can go to the bedroom.

139
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We were fighting a monster, right?

140
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

141
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You fainted, right?

142
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then?

143
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Then where is my monster now?

144
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Who is defeating it?

145
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, right.

146
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hey, Pegah.

147
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't be a coward when you go in.

148
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I am so curious.

149
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I woke up and found it in the bedroom.

150
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You fainted, right?

151
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Then the teachers and Professor Aldebaran came.

152
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Professor Aldebaran defeated the monster, right?

153
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes, that's right.

154
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I am the monster.

155
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Professor Aldebaran was defeated.

156
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I am the monster.

157
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
As long as Professor Aldebaran is here, we are safe.

158
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's right.

159
00:15:43,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why am I here?

160
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Thank God.

161
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You both are awake.

162
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Professor Ali.

163
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Where is the monster?

164
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Calm down, Professor Purwa.

165
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The monster has been defeated.

166
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That means the 8th prince is here.

167
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Because only he can defeat it.

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Calm down, Professor Purwa.

169
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The 8th prince is not here.

170
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But the chosen one has succeeded in defeating him.

171
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Who is he?

172
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I am sorry.

173
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But I have promised not to tell anyone.

174
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Clearly, the chosen one is among our students here.

175
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The 8th Prince

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Alfa?

177
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Alfa, you have to protect the Stone of Eternity in this school.

178
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What is the Stone of Eternity?

179
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The Stone of Eternity is a very strong stone.

180
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The stone cannot fall into the wrong hands.

181
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You have to protect the stone.

182
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But how do I protect it?

183
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Protect it with your heart, Alfa.

184
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How do you know this school?

185
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And you know my name?

186
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Who are you?

187
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
One day you will know who we really are.

188
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The Stone of Eternity

189
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hey!

190
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Who are you?

191
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What is it?

192
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I had a weird dream.

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What dream?

194
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This.

195
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What is that?

196
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The Stone of Eternity

197
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What?

198
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I was visited by someone.

199
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And that person is really nice.

200
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I can feel that they love me.

201
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And the weirdest thing is,

202
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
they told me to protect the Stone of Eternity in this school.

203
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The Stone of Eternity?

204
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What is that?

205
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I just heard it.

206
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Maybe it's just a dream.

207
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm going to sleep.

208
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sleepy.

209
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Wait!

210
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The dream is real.

211
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's real.

212
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The person in the dream must be serious.

213
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Who is the person in your dream?

214
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know. I don't know him.

215
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's do this.

216
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Tomorrow we ask the teacher.

217
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Maybe he knows.

218
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The person in your dream must be serious.

219
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Where is he?

220
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There he is.

221
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, yeah.

222
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Let's go.

223
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Tentara.

224
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What is the Stone of Eternity?

225
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The Stone of Eternity

226
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
is the Stone that is protected by the Three-Headed Dragon.

227
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So, the Stone of Eternity really exists?

228
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Alfa.

229
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You...

230
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
How do you know the Stone of Eternity?

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You're just in the first grade.

232
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You don't know that yet.

233
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Come on.

234
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Over there.

235
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm busy cooking for the Three-Headed Dragon.

236
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So, the Three-Headed Dragon...

237
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
likes Rendang, Gudeg, and Salted Fish.

238
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This.

239
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This is my food.

240
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I love eating Gudeg, Salted Fish, and Rendang.

241
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm hungry.

242
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Don't disturb me.

243
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Come on.

244
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Let's go.

245
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This is the mouth.

246
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There's a stone behind the dragon.

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And the dragon guards the stone.

248
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What's with the stone?

249
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why is it guarded?

250
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't know.

251
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Don't you dare to eat or do anything...

252
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
during my class time.

253
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You all know that...

254
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
the students have entered our school.

255
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And for that, there's a new rule that will be applied.

256
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
After 8 PM,

257
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
all students are forbidden to leave the classroom.

258
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And if anyone steps,

259
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the perpetrator will be punished.

260
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And one classroom will be punished.

261
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Do you understand?

262
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes, sir.

263
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Good.

264
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Now, I will teach a new mantra...

265
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that you can use to take other things.

266
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Pay attention.

267
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Nafatang Buku.

268
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Sambung.

269
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Now,

270
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
focus.

271
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And you all try it.

272
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Now, start.

273
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Nafatang Buku.

274
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
(The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

275
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's so cool.

276
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Nafatang Buku.

277
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
(The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

278
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Nafatang Buku.

279
00:25:34,000 --> 00:26:08,000
(The perpetrator is Nafatang Buku.)

280
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Alfa.

281
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You are to clean this page.

282
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
How long do you need?

283
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Three hours, sir.

284
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
To live in this world.

285
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's not as easy as living in the real world.

286
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You have three minutes...

287
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
to clean this page.

288
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And you have to finish it.

289
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Do you understand?

290
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Three minutes?

291
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Sir.

292
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I think, sir...

293
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
for Alfa's size...

294
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the punishment is too heavy.

295
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This is still in my class.

296
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So I have the right to decide...

297
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
anything for the students' education.

298
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I forgot, sir.

299
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
If so, please continue.

300
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Thank you.

301
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Alfa.

302
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Do as I say.

303
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If you can't finish it...

304
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
your punishment will be heavier.

305
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
(Alfa's punishment is heavier.)

306
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Three.

307
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Two minutes and 59 seconds.

308
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Two minutes and 58 seconds.

309
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:57,000
A box of fruit.

310
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
There's a ripe fruit.

311
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm hungry.

312
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll try it.

313
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It must be delicious.

314
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Get the fruit.

315
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I've learned the mantra, "Mindai Menda".

316
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's a good idea.

317
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I can use the mantra for this punishment.

318
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Let's try.

319
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Get the small piece of paper.

320
00:28:30,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Get the paper.

321
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I did it!

322
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I've finished it all!

323
00:29:35,000 --> 00:30:49,000
(The punishment is heavier.)

324
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You have to answer my question.

325
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Who is the chosen one?

326
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I can't answer, Prof.

327
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Because my mouth has been sworn by the mantra to tell anyone.

328
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I see.

329
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Now, you have to do what I ask you to do.

330
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because you know who the chosen one is.

331
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You have to make the chosen one...

332
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
...enter the secret room...

333
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
...and take the stone to the body.

334
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yes, Prof.

335
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
One more thing.

336
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You have to lead the chosen one to take the stone to the body.

337
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Alfa, we want to help you with the punishment.

338
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yes.

339
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Do we still need to work?

340
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
No, the punishment is over.

341
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Why is it so fast?

342
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yes, how come?

343
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Alfa, come to my room now.

344
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:21,000
What's wrong with me?

345
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You're smart.

346
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You know everything.

347
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But I don't know everything.

348
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm going to find out.

349
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Alfa, I'm calling you because you have to do something for me.

350
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Tonight.

351
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Before the sun rises, you have to go back to the secret room...

352
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
...and take the stone to the body for me.

353
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Isn't that forbidden?

354
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm not going to do it.

355
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Alfa, this school is in danger.

356
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And only the stone of eternity can save us all.

357
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But why should I take the stone?

358
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Because you have defeated the monster.

359
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It will come back to life when the sun rises.

360
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But how, ma'am?

361
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
There's a third head dragon there.

362
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And that dragon is very strong.

363
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I will tell you about the third head dragon.

364
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,000
300 years ago, there lived three great and brave dragon warriors.

365
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They were very loyal to their country.

366
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
They fed their livestock.

367
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

368
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And the man who was responsible for the dragon's head...

369
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
...was killed by the dragon itself.

370
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And the dragon was left alone.

371
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Until one day, they were faced by the dark dragon's army.

372
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The dark dragon's army was defeated by the dragon's head.

373
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But the dragon's head was cut off.

374
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And the dragon was left alone.

375
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

376
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And the dragon was left alone.

377
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

378
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And the dragon was left alone.

379
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Until one day, the dragon's head was cut off.

380
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And the dragon was left alone.

381
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:28,000
[music]

382
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And the third dragon was defeated.

383
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
[music]

384
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Ashifa and Imran were killed.

385
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The three dragons were very sad because they lost their parents.

386
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
[music]

387
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
The three dragons' tears shed light on the world.

388
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This made the three dragons unite.

389
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Senua became the head of the three great dragons.

390
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:39,000
[music]

391
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So the three dragons can fight if we give them the same food as their parents.

392
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I saw the army cooking three different foods.

393
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Is that right for the three dragons?

394
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That's right, Alfa.

395
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I've told you everything.

396
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Now it's up to you.

397
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Only you can take the Stone of Eternity and save all our lives.

398
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:48,000
[music]

399
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's scary when it's narrow.

400
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:10,000
[music]

401
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Now we have to make three different foods.

402
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The three dragons' favorite foods are rendang, kuduk, and nasinan.

403
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The dragons don't need us.

404
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We will help the eternity.

405
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So now we have to go to the kitchen.

406
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That's right. Let's go.

407
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:43,000
[music]

408
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Professor!

409
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:56,000
[music]

410
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Who's there?

411
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
[music]

412
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Come out!

413
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
[music]

414
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I said come out or I'll have to use magic.

415
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
[music]

416
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
One.

417
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
[music]

418
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Two.

419
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:45,000
[music]

420
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Three.

421
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
[music]

422
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I want to talk to you.

423
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Can you come out?

424
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:01,000
[music]

425
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Come.

426
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:28,000
[music]

427
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh my.

428
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Don't wait. Let's just take off the mask.

429
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
[sigh]

430
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Let's talk later.

431
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Now let's go to the kitchen to cook.

432
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes.

433
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Be careful.

434
00:40:43,000 --> 00:41:06,000
[music]

435
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's time.

436
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Come out.

437
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
[music]

438
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's like someone is cooking.

439
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
[music]

440
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Who's inside?

441
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:52,000
[music]

442
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
[sigh]

443
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:18,000

444
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000

445
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
[music]

446
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's heavy.

447
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
[music]

448
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Be careful.

449
00:42:32,000 --> 00:43:08,000
[music]

450
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Ray, Vega.

451
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
If the third-world soldiers don't like these foods and get more and more fierce,

452
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
you have to defend yourselves.

453
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Let me face it.

454
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
[music]

455
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yuda, let's go.

456
00:43:24,000 --> 00:44:18,000
[music]

457
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's scary.

458
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Be careful. It can drown the cloud.

459
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
[music]

460
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
[music]

462
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Ray, where are you going?

463
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Ray, his face is blue.

464
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Ray, he's poisoned.

465
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:54,000
[music]

466
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000

[music]

472
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We go.

473
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:51,000
[music]

474
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Ray.

475
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:18,000

476
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000

490
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I'm going to get you.

494
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray.

495
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Ray, his face is blue.

496
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Ray, he's poisoned.

497
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Poison gas can kill if there is no supply in two hours.

498
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
[music]

499
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Where are we?

500
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We have to take him to the clinic.

501
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
No, no, no.

502
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You just continue your task.

503
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You have to take the stone to the shrine before the sun sets.

504
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Let me take care of it, Ray.

505
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But...

506
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's okay.

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:58,000
[music]

508
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000

510
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Alpha.

[music]

512
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You have to succeed.

513
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:41,000
[music]

514
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm afraid this stone is not ready yet.

[music]

516
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
You'd better go to the shrine now.

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
[scream]

518
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
They are not just a bunch of angsa.

519
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But they are the daughter of an angsa.

520
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
[music]

521
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Alpha, why did you ask for the stone?

522
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Professor Agni asked for it, Professor.

523
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Because this school is in danger.

524
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Only that stone can save this school.

525
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Alpha must be released.

526
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Three days until the lunar month.

527
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And if in the lunar month, the dark lord gets the stone of peace.

528
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
He will get unlimited power.

529
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And will destroy this world.

530
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
[music]

531
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Show your spirit, get ready to chase your friends.

532
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Run, jump, climb, climb the stars.

533
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Be brave, don't give up.

534
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Chase your dreams and hopes.

535
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams.

536
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Go, go, go, never stop.

537
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart.

538
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:21,460
Go, Go, Go. make yourself proud, Go, Go, Go. let's dream, Go, Go, Go, we will.
