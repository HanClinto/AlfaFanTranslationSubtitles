 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 To be continued...

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Attack!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We won't stop until we get that fire crystal

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So we can all unite

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Damn, they're all united

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We can't let this happen, I have to stop them

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Don't touch me!

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Rita, you're so brave

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 You know, only bad people dare to attack their own friends

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I'm a bad person

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 She's not a bad person, she just can't control herself

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I'm glad I can help you

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 But you have to remember, you can't use your feelings

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 You have to control yourself, think of yourself

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And you have to let go of your love for others

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Let me go, help!

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Shut up!

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 It's useless to call them, they won't come for you

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Finally, the police called me

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Ah, I'm so lucky

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Oh no, what should I do?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I'm so sleepy

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Help!

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Help!

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Help!

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Rita!

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Where are you?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Rita, I'm here!

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 What should I do? I can't help you like this

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I'm stuck here!

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Rita!

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Help!

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I've learned Pegasus' spell

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 This is good, let me try

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Pegasus!

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 This is so small, how can it help me?

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Tell me!

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Bulgarda, I need Bulgarda

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Bulgarda

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Pegasus!

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Pegasus

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Wow, it's so big

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Bulgarda, let go of my rope

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Thank you Bulgarda

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Tell me!

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Rita, Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Rita, Ray, Pegasus

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Ray, Rita, where are you?

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Ray, Pegasus, Rita, where are you?

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I'll look for Rita

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Okay, bye

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Let me go!

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Help!

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Help me, Sir!

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Rita, you have to gather your strength and attack them

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Pegasus, Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Now you throw the people who hurt you, hurry up!

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Pegasus, Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Pegasus, Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Rita, where are you?

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Where is Rita?

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I don't know, when I got here, Rita was gone

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Where is she?

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Rita!

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Rita!

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Ray, use your thunder

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Okay

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Sir, Rita is under that man's roof

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Sir, Rita is under that man's roof

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Stop!

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Rita, let's go back to school

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Yes, let's go back to school

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Don't follow him anymore

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Don't be fooled, boy

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Do you remember? They've made you sad, they've divorced you

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Rita, let's go back to school

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 We want to play the snake again

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Yes

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Let's go, Rita

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Let's go, Rita

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Let's go

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Pegasus!

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Pegasus, are you okay?

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Pegasus, are you okay?

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Vega, Vega

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Vega, don't force yourself

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Just write it down

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Pelita is so brave

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 She made Vega become like this

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I told you, she's a monster

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 That's why we shouldn't get close to her anymore

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I'm so sorry for what happened to Vega

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I shouldn't have gone

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Forgive me, Sir

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 You don't have to regret

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Make this a learning experience for you

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 You have to remember

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I will never leave you in any condition

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And this is your place

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I'm always by your side

 [The Snakes' Claw]

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 There's a truth

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Pelita has a very dangerous power

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And we have to be careful to catch her

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 We have to prepare more to fight that girl

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 If we can catch her

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 All the snakes will be gone

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Tri, you have to make a new weapon

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 A very powerful weapon

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 A weapon that can defeat the girl named Pelita

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Alright, we will take them down

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Pelita, let's go home

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Let's go home

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Let's go back to school

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Let's play together again

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

142
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 I feel so sorry for Vega

143
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Come on, Pelita

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 She must be so sad

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 She must be thinking about us

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Let's go home, Pelita

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Come on, Pelita

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Pelita

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Come on, Pelita

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Wake up, Pelita

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Wake up

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 What's wrong?

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Are you sick?

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 I'm not sick

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I feel so sorry for Vega

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Come on, Pelita

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Let's go home and play together again

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

159
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Pelita, let's go home

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Tentara, we have to help Vega

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 We have to take Vega to Pelita's place

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Tentara, will you?

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 I feel sorry for her

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Ava, don't be nervous

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's a very far place

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It's not only far, it's also dangerous

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 That's why I need your help

168
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 To make me safe

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Can you help me?

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Please, Tentara

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I feel sorry for Vega

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Please, I'm begging you

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Yes, Ava

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 We'll go there

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 What are you wearing?

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 How about this?

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 What do you think?

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It's a good idea, right?

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Buy a card, eh

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 It's full of coconut

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Good idea, eh

182
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It's Alva's idea

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Good, good

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Let's go

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I am the third head dragon

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I bring your favorite food

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Please enjoy

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Sorry for disturbing your time

 I'm sorry

192
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I'm sorry

193
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 For disturbing your time

194
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Change

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

196
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Come on, finish it

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Eat it

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Hold it tight

200
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Hold it tight

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Hold it tight

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Hold it

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 We'll succeed

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 This arrow is very powerful

207
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Whatever it hits

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Will turn into a stone

209
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Good

210
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Let's go

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So what should I do now?

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 We have to defend ourselves

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Until I can control the little one

214
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Hi, little one

215
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 That's the one who kidnapped me

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 How did he know you?

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Besides, you don't have to worry

218
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I've made a promise with the teachers at the magic school

219
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 To fight back against the elf warriors

220
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 So they won't disturb our plan now

221
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Good, Angkara

222
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Now your job is to eliminate Ray and Vicky

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I'll make the elf warriors destroy your elf

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 You have to kidnap the elf

225
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Yes, sir

226
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Just a moment

227
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Soon, Alva will be mine

229
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 What's that?

230
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

231
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 What are you doing?

232
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Stay there

233
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 You're a bad guy

234
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I won't let you hurt KvK

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Don't run, Kelita

236
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

237
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Where are you going?

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 It's late, go to bed

239
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I'll teach you a new skill tomorrow

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I don't want to

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I know everything

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 You're a bad guy

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 You're friends with the one who kidnapped me

244
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 You want to hurt KvK and Alva

245
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I don't want to be your friend

246
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Good, you're here

247
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Come here

248
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 How dare you

249
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

250
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

251
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

252
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

253
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

254
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

255
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

257
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Kelita!

258
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Kelita!

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

260
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Come on

261
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Thank you, Naga

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Thank you, Naga

263
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I think the place is near

264
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Thank you, Naga

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Thank you, Naga

266
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 I think the place is near

267
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

268
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

269
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

271
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

272
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

273
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

274
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

275
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Kelita!

276
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

277
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

278
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

279
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

280
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

281
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Kelita!

282
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Kelita, wake up!

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Kelita, wake up!

284
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Kelita, wake up!

285
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Kelita, wake up!

286
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Kelita, wake up!

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Keep going, Naga!

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Finish them off!

289
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Wake up!

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Wake up, Fega!

291
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Wake up, Fega!

292
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Wake up, Fega!

293
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Fega!

294
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Fega!

295
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Wake up!

296
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Wait, Fega!

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Wake up, Fega!

298
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Wake up, Fega!

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

300
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Wake up, Fega!

301
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

302
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Yes! Five!

303
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 One, two, three, four, five!

304
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Yeah!

305
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Wake up, Fega!

306
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Wake up!

307
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Wake up, Fega!

308
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

309
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

310
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Fega!

311
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

312
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 You're alive!

313
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I got you!

314
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Fega!

315
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

316
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I'm so glad you're not frozen again.

317
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 I'm so happy and proud.

318
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I'm not frozen again because of you.

319
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Because I love you so much.

320
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So, the ice cream melted.

321
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

322
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Felita.

323
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 From now on, fill your heart with love.

324
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Okay?

325
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And don't hate people.

326
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Okay?

327
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 One more thing.

328
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Don't be afraid to leave.

329
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 We'll always be with you.

330
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Okay?

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Okay.

332
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

333
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 It's all trees.

334
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 The plants here are my friends.

335
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

336
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

337
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I'm sorry.

338
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

339
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

340
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 [We can do it!]

341
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Where's Papua?

342
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Where's Papua?

343
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Kauat, he's after us!

344
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

345
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Purwocer!

346
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

347
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

348
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

349
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

350
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

351
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

352
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

353
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Look!

354
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 The ice is melting!

355
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Everything is back to normal.

356
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 This means that the firecrackers will return to us.

357
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

358
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

359
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

360
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

361
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 It's too late!

362
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

363
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

364
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

365
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 We did it!

366
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Yeah!

367
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 [The Snakes' Claw]

368
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 So, Vega succeeded in making the princess realize the meaning of love and sacrifice.

369
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And finally, all this mess ended.

370
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 That's right, Professor.

371
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And you, Megantara.

372
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Why did you let Alva and Vega run away from school?

373
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 You brought the Chief of the Three without reporting to me.

374
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Eating the snake's fish,

375
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 and sharing it with the coconut.

376
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I'm sorry.

377
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Again, I forgot.

378
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 I failed again.

379
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 I thought I could get the power to become a weapon.

380
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So, I don't have to face Aldebaran directly.

381
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Angara!

382
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Yes, sir.

383
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Do you know what you have to do?

384
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Yes, sir.

385
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 The Star of Destiny will appear tomorrow night.

386
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 I will get it and give it to you.

387
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 So you can get the power from the Star of Destiny.

388
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 No.

389
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 You have to get it, Angara.

390
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Don't fail.

391
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Yes, sir.

392
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 The falling star.

393
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 The falling star is...

394
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 a falling star...

395
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 that falls to the earth.

396
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And when it falls to the earth,

397
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 the star changes its form...

398
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 and becomes a falling woman.

399
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Then...

400
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Tommy.

401
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Tommy.

402
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Yes, sir.

403
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 When will the falling star appear?

404
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I don't know.

405
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Tommy.

406
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Tommy.

407
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Tommy!

408
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 When will the falling star appear?

409
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I don't know, sir.

410
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I don't know, sir.

411
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Listen.

412
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Vega knows when the falling star will appear.

413
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 The falling star...

414
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 fell about a thousand years ago.

415
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Good.

416
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 You're right.

417
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Good.

418
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Then, the question is...

419
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 why are the falling stars...

420
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 awaited by the people?

421
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Ray.

422
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Why are the falling stars...

423
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 awaited by the people?

424
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Maybe because...

425
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Maybe because...

426
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Because what?

427
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Because it's beautiful.

428
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 I don't know.

429
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Vega.

430
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Why are the falling stars...

431
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 awaited by the people?

432
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Because the falling star gives power.

433
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 There's no limit...

434
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 to what it can do.

435
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Especially the heart.

436
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Correct.

437
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Give Vega a round of applause.

438
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Why are the falling stars...

439
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 awaited by the people?

440
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Because the falling stars...

441
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 will be fought by the people...

442
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 who are thirsty for power.

443
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Therefore...

444
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Professor Aldebaran has confirmed...

445
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 that we are all...

446
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 forbidden to catch the falling stars.

447
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 [The Falling Stars]

448
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Thank you, Aldebaran.

449
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 [The Falling Stars]

450
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 There's a party.

451
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Party.

452
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 I like parties.

453
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Popo.

454
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 What?

455
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Don't touch me.

456
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 You'll turn into ice.

457
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 I'm afraid of the cold.

458
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Don't be afraid, Popo.

459
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 I can handle my power.

460
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Forgive me.

461
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 I made you freeze.

462
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Really?

463
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 You're a jinak.

464
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 What am I?

465
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Popo.

466
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Let's go home.

467
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Home?

468
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 I'm fine.

469
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 I'm free.

470
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 I'm not helping anyone.

471
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 I'm doing this for Alva's good.

472
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 I don't want to be a jinak.

473
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 We're sorry.

474
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 We're going to hurt you.

475
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 It's okay.

476
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Okay.

477
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 We'll go now.

478
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 [The Falling Stars]

479
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Let's gather.

480
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 There's a firework party.

481
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Yeah!

482
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 [The Falling Stars]

483
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 [The Falling Stars]

484
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 [The Falling Stars]

485
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 [The Falling Stars]

486
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 [The Falling Stars]

487
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 That's not a firework.

488
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 You better give up.

489
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Before the dark lord comes.

490
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 [The Falling Stars]

491
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 [The Falling Stars]

492
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 [The Falling Stars]

493
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 That's not a firework.

494
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Of course I like fireworks.

495
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 I'm with Bambu.

496
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 They look happy.

497
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 I'll find out.

498
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I was happy with the girl.

499
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 This is a trap.

500
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 We have to get the falling star.

501
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Let's go.

502
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 [The Falling Stars]

503
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 I'm sorry.

504
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 It's my fault.

505
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 That's the falling star.

506
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 I can't fail this time.

507
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 [The Falling Stars]

508
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 [The Falling Stars]

509
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 [The Falling Stars]

510
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 [The Falling Stars]

511
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Hey, get out of here.

512
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 [The Falling Stars]

513
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 [The Falling Stars]

514
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 [The Falling Stars]

515
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 [The Falling Stars]

516
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 [The Falling Stars]

517
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 [The Falling Stars]

518
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 [The Falling Stars]

519
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 [The Falling Stars]

520
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 You better give up.

521
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 Before the 8th prince comes here,

522
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 we won't let him go.

523
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Before we get his heart.

524
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Don't dream.

525
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Everyone wants his heart.

526
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 But it's not that easy.

527
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 Step on my body first.

528
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 Step on my body first.

529
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 [The Falling Stars]

530
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Step on my body first.

531
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 [The Falling Stars]

532
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 [The Falling Stars]

533
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 [The Falling Stars]

534
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 [The Falling Stars]

535
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 [The Falling Stars]

536
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 [The Falling Stars]

537
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 It's so heavy.

538
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 Here, take a rest.

539
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 It's heavy.

540
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 You want to take my heart, right?

541
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 No, it's not me.

542
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Go away, you're a bad person.

543
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 [The Falling Stars]

544
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 [The Falling Stars]

545
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 [The Falling Stars]

546
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 [The Falling Stars]

547
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 God, help me.

548
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 Alright, I'll help you.

549
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 [The Falling Stars]

550
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 I'll make you sleep forever.

551
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 You're a bad person.

552
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 You're rude.

553
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 It turns out you can use my magic.

554
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 But I won't lose.

555
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 [The Falling Stars]

556
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 [The Falling Stars]

557
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 [The Falling Stars]

558
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Hey, you!

559
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 [The Falling Stars]

560
00:44:42,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Thank you for helping me.

561
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 I'm sorry, I misjudged you.

562
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 I hit you too.

563
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 Yes, when you landed, they were fighting for your battle.

564
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 So I took you away from there.

565
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 I'm so sorry.

566
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 I'm so bad.

567
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 You want to forgive me, right?

568
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Yes.

569
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 [The Falling Stars]

570
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 [The Falling Stars]

571
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 [The Falling Stars]

572
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 Where's the falling star?

573
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 The falling star is gone.

574
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 It's all your fault.

575
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 You should be punished.

576
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 [The Falling Stars]

577
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 [The Falling Stars]

578
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Listen!

579
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 The falling star is mine.

580
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 If you meet it, you can't touch it.

581
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Not even see it.

582
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Do you understand?

583
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Good.

584
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Goodbye.

585
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 [The Falling Stars]

586
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 [The Falling Stars]

587
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 [The Falling Stars]

588
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 I think this belongs to the Sido School.

589
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 They must have taken the falling star.

590
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 Yes, they did.

591
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Let's go there.

592
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 My name is Selena.

593
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Alva, I'm from Sido School.

594
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Alva, I beg you.

595
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 Don't tell anyone that I'm the falling star.

596
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Because they will all fight me.

597
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 My hair will be cut.

598
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 Because my hair can make any kind of clothes.

599
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 And my tears will be squeezed.

600
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 Because my tears can create new power.

601
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 And can cure any kind of disease.

602
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 And my heart.

603
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 If my heart is taken and eaten.

604
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 It can create unlimited power.

605
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 [The Falling Stars]

606
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 They will fight to get you.

607
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 I'm scared, Alva.

608
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 I want to go back to heaven.

609
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 Okay, don't be sad.

610
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 I promise I won't tell anyone about you.

611
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 And I will help you until you go back to heaven.

612
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 Are you serious?

613
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 Yes.

614
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 You're so kind.

615
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 Thank you, Alva.

616
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 Promise.

617
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 Don't go anywhere.

618
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 Because this place is safe.

619
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 I will go back to the party.

620
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 Because they are looking for me.

621
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Okay.

622
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 If you don't want to tell us where the falling star is.

623
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 We will find it ourselves.

624
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 [The Falling Stars]

625
00:49:43,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 Ali Baran!

626
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Why are you all here?

627
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 [The Falling Stars]

628
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 Are you the soldiers?

629
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Or the rebels?

630
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 Hey, what's the truth?

631
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 Where did you hide the falling star?

632
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 Hurry, return it. Because it's ours.

633
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 [The Falling Stars]

634
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 The falling star.

635
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 I don't understand.

636
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 Don't pretend.

637
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 This is the proof.

638
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 [The Falling Stars]

639
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 We found this brooch at the place where the falling star was.

640
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 Calm down.

641
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding.

642
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 The proof is with us.

643
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 And it can't be wrong.

644
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 If you don't want to tell us where the falling star is.

645
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 We will find it ourselves.

646
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 Wait.

647
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 I won't let you in without my permission.

648
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Or you have to face me.

649
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 [The Falling Stars]

650
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 Okay, let's go.

651
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 The bottom line is that they are really dead.

652
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 But, they were just crushed a little.

653
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 And now they are gone.

654
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 Professor Nadia Bara.

655
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 What do we do now?

656
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 This seems like a very serious problem.

657
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 I will find out about the falling star.

658
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 You stay alert.

659
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 I will find the answer.

660
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 Agni, bring the kids inside.

661
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 Come on, kids.

662
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Alva, where are you from?

663
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 Alva, where are you from?

664
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 We are looking for the answer.

665
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 I can't tell you that I'm a fan of The Falling Stars.

666
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 I have promised.

667
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 I have a stomachache.

668
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 That's why I have been in the toilet.

669
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 Alva has a stomachache.

670
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 I will take the medicine at the clinic.

671
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 No need.

672
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 I'm already well.

673
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 Let's go there.

674
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 The teachers will look for us.

675
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Let's go.

676
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 It's been a long time since I've been here.

677
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 What is he doing?

678
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 He thinks I'm just singing.

 To be continued...

696
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 Alva, where are we?

697
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 We're at the toilet.

698
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 Toilet?

699
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 Why are we at the toilet?

700
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 We're at the toilet.

701
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 Why are we at the toilet?

702
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 We're at the toilet.

703
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 If you're a princess...

704
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 Just hold my hand...

705
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 Princess...

706
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 Princess...

707
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 Princess...

708
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 Alva?

709
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 Selena?

710
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 Why is it so crowded here?

711
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 What are you doing here?

712
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 Do you want to join the dance and sing?

713
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 Come on.

714
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 No, no, no.

715
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 Come here.

716
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 No, no, no.

717
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 I don't want to.

718
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 I don't want to dance and sing.

719
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 Then, what are you doing here?

720
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 I want you to be quiet.

721
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Why should I be quiet?

722
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 Because if you dance and sing...

723
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 Your voice will be heard by my neighbors.

724
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 People will be suspicious.

725
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 Then, what should I do?

726
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 Just sleep.

727
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 It's late now.

728
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 Alva, I'm a star.

729
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 My duty is to light up the night.

730
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 So, I can't sleep at night.

731
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 But you can't be noisy.

732
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 If you're caught,

733
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 and you're taken by the heart,

734
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 what will happen?

735
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 You'll be taken by the heart.

736
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 That's why...

737
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 you can't be noisy.

738
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 I'll go now.

739
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 Bye.

740
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 Idiot.

741
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 You can't do that.

742
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 I'm sorry, sir.

743
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 It's all because of me, the Elven warriors.

744
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:57,000
 I don't want to hear your excuses.

745
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 Why did you let her go?

746
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 I have to get the fallen star.

747
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 Help!

748
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Help!

749
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 The fallen star.

750
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 You're great, sir!

751
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 How can I be in that cave?

752
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 It's so cold.

00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000

00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:10,680
 Running, sprinting, jumping, galloping

756

 Brave, unfamiliar, confessions

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,680
 Go, go, go!

761
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,680
 Never stop

762
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,680
 Go, go, go!

763
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,680
