1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Attack!

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We won't stop until we get that fire crystal

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So we can all unite

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Damn, they're all united

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We can't let this happen, I have to stop them

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't touch me!

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Rita, you're so brave

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You know, only bad people dare to attack their own friends

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm a bad person

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She's not a bad person, she just can't control herself

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm glad I can help you

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But you have to remember, you can't use your feelings

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You have to control yourself, think of yourself

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And you have to let go of your love for others

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let me go, help!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Shut up!

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's useless to call them, they won't come for you

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Finally, the police called me

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ah, I'm so lucky

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh no, what should I do?

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm so sleepy

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Help!

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Rita!

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where are you?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Rita, I'm here!

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What should I do? I can't help you like this

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm stuck here!

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Rita!

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Help!

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've learned Pegasus' spell

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is good, let me try

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Pegasus!

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is so small, how can it help me?

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tell me!

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Bulgarda, I need Bulgarda

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Bulgarda

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Pegasus!

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Pegasus

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Wow, it's so big

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Bulgarda, let go of my rope

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you Bulgarda

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Tell me!

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Rita, Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Rita, Ray, Pegasus

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ray, Rita, where are you?

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Ray, Pegasus, Rita, where are you?

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll look for Rita

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay, bye

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let me go!

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Help!

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Help me, Sir!

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Rita, you have to gather your strength and attack them

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Pegasus, Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now you throw the people who hurt you, hurry up!

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Pegasus, Ray, Pegasus, where are you?

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Rita, where are you?

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where is Rita?

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't know, when I got here, Rita was gone

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Where is she?

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Rita!

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ray, use your thunder

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sir, Rita is under that man's roof

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Stop!

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Rita, let's go back to school

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes, let's go back to school

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't follow him anymore

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't be fooled, boy

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you remember? They've made you sad, they've divorced you

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Rita, let's go back to school

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We want to play the snake again

83
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes

84
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's go, Rita

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's go

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Pegasus!

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Pegasus, are you okay?

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Vega, Vega

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Vega, don't force yourself

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Just write it down

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Pelita is so brave

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She made Vega become like this

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I told you, she's a monster

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's why we shouldn't get close to her anymore

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm so sorry for what happened to Vega

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I shouldn't have gone

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Forgive me, Sir

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You don't have to regret

99
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Make this a learning experience for you

100
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You have to remember

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I will never leave you in any condition

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And this is your place

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm always by your side

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There's a truth

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Pelita has a very dangerous power

107
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And we have to be careful to catch her

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We have to prepare more to fight that girl

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If we can catch her

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
All the snakes will be gone

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Tri, you have to make a new weapon

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A very powerful weapon

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A weapon that can defeat the girl named Pelita

114
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Alright, we will take them down

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

116
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Pelita, let's go home

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's go home

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's go back to school

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's play together again

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

121
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I feel so sorry for Vega

122
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come on, Pelita

123
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She must be so sad

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
She must be thinking about us

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go home, Pelita

126
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Come on, Pelita

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Pelita

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Come on, Pelita

129
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wake up, Pelita

130
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wake up

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What's wrong?

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you sick?

133
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm not sick

134
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I feel so sorry for Vega

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Come on, Pelita

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's go home and play together again

137
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Pelita, let's go home

139
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Tentara, we have to help Vega

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We have to take Vega to Pelita's place

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tentara, will you?

142
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I feel sorry for her

143
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Ava, don't be nervous

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's a very far place

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's not only far, it's also dangerous

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's why I need your help

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
To make me safe

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Can you help me?

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Please, Tentara

150
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I feel sorry for Vega

151
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Please, I'm begging you

152
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes, Ava

153
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We'll go there

154
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What are you wearing?

155
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How about this?

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you think?

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a good idea, right?

158
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Buy a card, eh

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's full of coconut

160
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Good idea, eh

161
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's Alfa's idea

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Good, good

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's go

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I am the third head dragon

166
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I bring your favorite food

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Please enjoy

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Sorry for disturbing your time

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry

170
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
For disturbing your time

171
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Change

172
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Come on, finish it

174
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Eat it

175
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Hold it tight

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hold it

178
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:15,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

179
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We'll succeed

180
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This arrow is very powerful

181
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Whatever it hits

182
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Will turn into a stone

183
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Good

184
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Let's go

185
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So what should I do now?

186
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We have to defend ourselves

187
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Until I can control the little one

188
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hi, little one

189
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's the one who kidnapped me

190
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
How did he know you?

191
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Besides, you don't have to worry

192
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I've made a promise with the teachers at the magic school

193
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
To fight back against the elf warriors

194
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So they won't disturb our plan now

195
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Good, Angkara

196
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Now your job is to eliminate Ray and Vicky

197
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll make the elf warriors destroy your elf

198
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You have to kidnap the elf

199
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes, sir

200
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Just a moment

201
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

202
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Soon, Alfa will be mine

203
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What's that?

204
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

205
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What are you doing?

206
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Stay there

207
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're a bad guy

208
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I won't let you hurt KvK

209
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't run, Kelita

210
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

211
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Where are you going?

212
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's late, go to bed

213
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll teach you a new skill tomorrow

214
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't want to

215
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I know everything

216
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're a bad guy

217
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You're friends with the one who kidnapped me

218
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You want to hurt KvK and Alfa

219
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't want to be your friend

220
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Good, you're here

221
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Come here

222
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How dare you

223
00:18:36,000 --> 00:19:19,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

224
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Kelita!

225
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

226
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Come on

227
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Thank you, Naga

228
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think the place is near

229
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Thank you, Naga

230
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I think the place is near

231
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:26,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

232
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Kelita!

233
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:54,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

234
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Kelita!

235
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Kelita, wake up!

236
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Keep going, Naga!

237
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Finish them off!

238
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Wake up!

239
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Wake up, Fega!

240
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Fega!

241
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Wake up!

242
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Wait, Fega!

243
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wake up, Fega!

244
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:19,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

245
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Wake up, Fega!

246
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:39,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

247
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes! Five!

248
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
One, two, three, four, five!

249
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah!

250
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Wake up, Fega!

251
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Wake up!

252
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Wake up, Fega!

253
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:35,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

254
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Fega!

255
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:52,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

256
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You're alive!

257
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I got you!

258
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Fega!

259
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:16,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

260
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm so glad you're not frozen again.

261
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm so happy and proud.

262
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm not frozen again because of you.

263
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because I love you so much.

264
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So, the ice cream melted.

265
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:41,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

266
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Felita.

267
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
From now on, fill your heart with love.

268
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay?

269
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And don't hate people.

270
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay?

271
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
One more thing.

272
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't be afraid to leave.

273
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We'll always be with you.

274
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Okay?

275
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay.

276
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:21,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

277
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's all trees.

278
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The plants here are my friends.

279
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:47,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

280
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:59,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

282
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
[We can do it!]

283
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Where's Papua?

284
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Kauat, he's after us!

285
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

286
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Purwocer!

287
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:25,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

288
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Look!

289
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The ice is melting!

290
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Everything is back to normal.

291
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
This means that the firecrackers will return to us.

292
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:49,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

293
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's too late!

294
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

295
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We did it!

296
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah!

297
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
[The Snakes' Claw]

298
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, Vega succeeded in making the princess realize the meaning of love and sacrifice.

299
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And finally, all this mess ended.

300
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That's right, Professor.

301
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And you, Megantara.

302
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Why did you let Alfa and Vega run away from school?

303
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You brought the Chief of the Three without reporting to me.

304
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Eating the snake's fish,

305
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and sharing it with the coconut.

306
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Again, I forgot.

308
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I failed again.

309
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I thought I could get the power to become a weapon.

310
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So, I don't have to face Aldebaran directly.

311
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Angara!

312
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, sir.

313
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Do you know what you have to do?

314
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes, sir.

315
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The Star of Destiny will appear tomorrow night.

316
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I will get it and give it to you.

317
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So you can get the power from the Star of Destiny.

318
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
No.

319
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You have to get it, Angara.

320
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Don't fail.

321
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yes, sir.

322
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The falling star.

323
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The falling star is...

324
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
a falling star...

325
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
that falls to the earth.

326
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And when it falls to the earth,

327
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
the star changes its form...

328
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and becomes a falling woman.

329
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Then...

330
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Tommy.

331
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes, sir.

332
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
When will the falling star appear?

333
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't know.

334
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Tommy.

335
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Tommy!

336
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
When will the falling star appear?

337
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't know, sir.

338
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Listen.

339
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Vega knows when the falling star will appear.

340
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The falling star...

341
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
fell about a thousand years ago.

342
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Good.

343
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You're right.

344
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Good.

345
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Then, the question is...

346
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
why are the falling stars...

347
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
awaited by the people?

348
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Ray.

349
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Why are the falling stars...

350
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
awaited by the people?

351
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Maybe because...

352
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because what?

353
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because it's beautiful.

354
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I don't know.

355
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Vega.

356
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Why are the falling stars...

357
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
awaited by the people?

358
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Because the falling star gives power.

359
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There's no limit...

360
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
to what it can do.

361
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Especially the heart.

362
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Correct.

363
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Give Vega a round of applause.

364
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Why are the falling stars...

365
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
awaited by the people?

366
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Because the falling stars...

367
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
will be fought by the people...

368
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
who are thirsty for power.

369
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Therefore...

370
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Professor Aldebaran has confirmed...

371
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
that we are all...

372
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
forbidden to catch the falling stars.

373
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
[The Falling Stars]

374
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Thank you, Aldebaran.

375
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
[The Falling Stars]

376
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
There's a party.

377
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Party.

378
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I like parties.

379
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Popo.

380
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What?

381
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Don't touch me.

382
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You'll turn into ice.

383
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm afraid of the cold.

384
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Don't be afraid, Popo.

385
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I can handle my power.

386
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Forgive me.

387
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I made you freeze.

388
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Really?

389
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You're a jinak.

390
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What am I?

391
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Popo.

392
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Let's go home.

393
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Home?

394
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm fine.

395
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm free.

396
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not helping anyone.

397
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm doing this for Alfa's good.

398
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't want to be a jinak.

399
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We're sorry.

400
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We're going to hurt you.

401
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's okay.

402
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Okay.

403
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We'll go now.

404
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
[The Falling Stars]

405
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Let's gather.

406
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
There's a firework party.

407
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah!

408
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:22,000
[The Falling Stars]

409
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's not a firework.

410
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You better give up.

411
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Before the dark lord comes.

412
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:18,000
[The Falling Stars]

413
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That's not a firework.

414
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Of course I like fireworks.

415
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm with Bambu.

416
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
They look happy.

417
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'll find out.

418
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I was happy with the girl.

419
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This is a trap.

420
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
We have to get the falling star.

421
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Let's go.

422
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
[The Falling Stars]

423
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's my fault.

425
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:53,000
That's the falling star.

426
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I can't fail this time.

427
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:20,000
[The Falling Stars]

428
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Hey, get out of here.

429
00:38:43,000 --> 00:39:52,000
[The Falling Stars]

430
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You better give up.

431
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Before the 8th prince comes here,

432
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
we won't let him go.

433
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Before we get his heart.

434
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Don't dream.

435
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Everyone wants his heart.

436
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But it's not that easy.

437
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Step on my body first.

438
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
[The Falling Stars]

439
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Step on my body first.

440
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:34,000
[The Falling Stars]

441
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's so heavy.

442
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Here, take a rest.

443
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's heavy.

444
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You want to take my heart, right?

445
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
No, it's not me.

446
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Go away, you're a bad person.

447
00:42:27,000 --> 00:43:03,000
[The Falling Stars]

448
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:18,000
God, help me.

449
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Alright, I'll help you.

450
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
[The Falling Stars]

451
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'll make you sleep forever.

452
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You're a bad person.

453
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You're rude.

454
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It turns out you can use my magic.

455
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
But I won't lose.

456
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:15,000
[The Falling Stars]

457
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Hey, you!

458
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
[The Falling Stars]

459
00:44:42,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Thank you for helping me.

460
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm sorry, I misjudged you.

461
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I hit you too.

462
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes, when you landed, they were fighting for your battle.

463
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So I took you away from there.

464
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm so sorry.

465
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm so bad.

466
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You want to forgive me, right?

467
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yes.

468
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:37,000
[The Falling Stars]

469
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Where's the falling star?

470
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The falling star is gone.

471
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's all your fault.

472
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You should be punished.

473
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:27,000
[The Falling Stars]

474
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Listen!

475
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
The falling star is mine.

476
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
If you meet it, you can't touch it.

477
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Not even see it.

478
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Do you understand?

479
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Good.

480
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Goodbye.

481
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:25,000
[The Falling Stars]

482
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I think this belongs to the Sido School.

483
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
They must have taken the falling star.

484
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yes, they did.

485
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Let's go there.

486
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
My name is Selena.

487
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Alfa, I'm from Sido School.

488
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Alfa, I beg you.

489
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Don't tell anyone that I'm the falling star.

490
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Because they will all fight me.

491
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
My hair will be cut.

492
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because my hair can make any kind of clothes.

493
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And my tears will be squeezed.

494
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Because my tears can create new power.

495
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And can cure any kind of disease.

496
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And my heart.

497
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
If my heart is taken and eaten.

498
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It can create unlimited power.

499
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
[The Falling Stars]

500
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
They will fight to get you.

501
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm scared, Alfa.

502
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I want to go back to heaven.

503
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Okay, don't be sad.

504
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I promise I won't tell anyone about you.

505
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And I will help you until you go back to heaven.

506
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Are you serious?

507
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yes.

508
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You're so kind.

509
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Thank you, Alfa.

510
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Promise.

511
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Don't go anywhere.

512
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Because this place is safe.

513
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I will go back to the party.

514
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because they are looking for me.

515
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Okay.

516
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:36,000
If you don't want to tell us where the falling star is.

517
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
We will find it ourselves.

518
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
[The Falling Stars]

519
00:49:43,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Ali Baran!

520
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Why are you all here?

521
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
[The Falling Stars]

522
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Are you the soldiers?

523
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Or the rebels?

524
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Hey, what's the truth?

525
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Where did you hide the falling star?

526
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Hurry, return it. Because it's ours.

527
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
[The Falling Stars]

528
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:50,000
The falling star.

529
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I don't understand.

530
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Don't pretend.

531
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
This is the proof.

532
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
[The Falling Stars]

533
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
We found this brooch at the place where the falling star was.

534
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Calm down.

535
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding.

536
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The proof is with us.

537
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And it can't be wrong.

538
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
If you don't want to tell us where the falling star is.

539
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We will find it ourselves.

540
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Wait.

541
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I won't let you in without my permission.

542
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Or you have to face me.

543
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
[The Falling Stars]

544
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Okay, let's go.

545
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:15,000
The bottom line is that they are really dead.

546
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But, they were just crushed a little.

547
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And now they are gone.

548
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Professor Nadia Bara.

549
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
What do we do now?

550
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
This seems like a very serious problem.

551
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I will find out about the falling star.

552
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You stay alert.

553
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I will find the answer.

554
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Agni, bring the kids inside.

555
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Come on, kids.

556
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Alfa, where are you from?

557
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
We are looking for the answer.

558
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I can't tell you that I'm a fan of The Falling Stars.

559
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I have promised.

560
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I have a stomachache.

561
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
That's why I have been in the toilet.

562
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Alfa has a stomachache.

563
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I will take the medicine at the clinic.

564
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
No need.

565
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm already well.

566
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Let's go there.

567
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The teachers will look for us.

568
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Let's go.

569
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It's been a long time since I've been here.

570
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
What is he doing?

571
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:49,000
He thinks I'm just singing.

572
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Alfa, where are we?

573
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
We're at the toilet.

574
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Toilet?

575
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Why are we at the toilet?

576
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
We're at the toilet.

577
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Why are we at the toilet?

578
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
We're at the toilet.

579
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
If you're a princess...

580
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Just hold my hand...

581
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Princess...

582
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Alfa?

583
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Selena?

584
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Why is it so crowded here?

585
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What are you doing here?

586
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Do you want to join the dance and sing?

587
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Come on.

588
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
No, no, no.

589
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Come here.

590
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
No, no, no.

591
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't want to.

592
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't want to dance and sing.

593
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Then, what are you doing here?

594
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I want you to be quiet.

595
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Why should I be quiet?

596
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Because if you dance and sing...

597
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Your voice will be heard by my neighbors.

598
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
People will be suspicious.

599
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Then, what should I do?

600
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Just sleep.

601
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It's late now.

602
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Alfa, I'm a star.

603
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
My duty is to light up the night.

604
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So, I can't sleep at night.

605
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
But you can't be noisy.

606
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
If you're caught,

607
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
and you're taken by the heart,

608
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
what will happen?

609
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You'll be taken by the heart.

610
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
That's why...

611
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
you can't be noisy.

612
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I'll go now.

613
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Bye.

614
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Idiot.

615
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You can't do that.

616
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I'm sorry, sir.

617
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's all because of me, the Elven warriors.

618
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I don't want to hear your excuses.

619
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Why did you let her go?

620
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I have to get the fallen star.

621
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Help!

622
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The fallen star.

623
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You're great, sir!

624
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:54,000
How can I be in that cave?

625
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's so cold.

626
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
[music]

627
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:10,680
Running, sprinting, jumping, galloping

628
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:17,480
Brave, unfamiliar, confessions

629
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:24,680
Chase, hope, and dreams

630
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,000
Go, go, go!

631
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Get everywhere dreams

632
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,680
Go, go, go!

633
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,680
Never stop

634
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,680
Go, go, go!

635
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,680
Fight with the power of your heart

636
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,680
Go, go, go!

637
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,680
Make yourself proud

638
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,680
Go, go, go!

639
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,680
Let's dream!

640
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,680
Go, go, go!

641
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,680
We will!
