1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will make him my son

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will make him proud

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it true, my teacher?

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alva and Tommy, you have to ride your bike into the forest

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And in the forest, you have to catch a ghost

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
After you catch the ghost, you have to bring it to the finish line

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's Alva, she made me lose my faith in life

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will make her lose

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Alva, I'm going right, you go left, let's see who gets the ghost first

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Where is the ghost? I can't find it

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Where is it?

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's not here

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ouch, who threw the black cloth?

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It hurts

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, it's you

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How are you?

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm fine

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you want to surrender yourself, then I will catch you and bring you to the finish line

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you want to? I need your help

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Try to catch me if you can

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, you have been taught the ghost mantra

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What are you doing, Alva?

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ghost!

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's all? You're so stupid

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going up

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Where are you going?

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I missed

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're so stupid, you can't catch me

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Run!

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Alva is gone

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ghost!

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ghost, sit behind me

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now I will win

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My dad has a life fluid

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So if you want to be caught by me, I will give you the life fluid

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's right, this time I want to be caught by you, but the life fluid first

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tom, is it true that I was given a life fluid?

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes, you're so stupid, just sit down

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sure Alva hasn't caught the ghost yet

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sure I will win

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:42,000
My body hurts

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm in pain

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is it here?

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ghost!

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, I tried to save Professor Titan

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where is Professor Titan?

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sure he's in the fake Professor Titan's lab

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I told Professor Agni

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm late for Alva and Tom's competition

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Professor Agni!

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, Vega?

64
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's so scary

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Vega, you didn't watch the competition?

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There's something more important than the competition

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What is it, Vega?

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Professor Titan

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What about Professor Titan?

70
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Professor Titan, who has been in our school, is fake

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's the eighth ghost

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The eighth ghost?

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes, Professor

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The real Professor Titan is hidden in the closet

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I saw it myself, Prof

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I even helped Professor Titan

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But when I didn't help him, the ghost attacked me again

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you sure about this, Vega?

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, Prof

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's why Professor followed me until we saw it together

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go, Prof

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Where is the ghost?

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How could it just disappear?

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't see the other ghosts

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Raya, where are you?

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Raya, don't disappear!

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I feel sorry for you, you haven't got the ghost yet

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I already got the ghost

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm going to win now

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Bye

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Bye, Prof

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't come in!

93
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's why you shouldn't tease people

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll look for the ghost again

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So I can win

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm going to win

97
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're the one who should be the one to ride the bike, not me

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It hurts

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're always angry, that's why it hurts

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's just rest here

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Where is it? I haven't seen it

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Where is it?

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's look for it

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Poor Raya

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's so brave

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Even though our job is to catch her

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She's a ghost

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm going to catch it

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There it is!

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where is it?

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're done, Alva

112
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The ghost is hiding

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You won't get the ghost

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Here it is

115
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's a life line!

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Raybounty, there's a life line!

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's a life line!

118
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hey!

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alva, where's the life line?

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Give it to me

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Here it is

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Ghost!

123
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to pull it

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can't go anywhere now

125
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Alva, you lied to me

126
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let me go

127
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Move!

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go inside

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't, Vega. That's not nice

130
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We should make sure it's true

131
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Professor Titan

132
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Excuse me, Professor Titan

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Professor Titan

134
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, please come in

135
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Professor!

136
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry, Professor

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Ahoy!

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Smile, everyone

139
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's a beautiful and talented professor

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Professor Agni's presence is not embarrassing

141
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But this is a blessing for me, Professor

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Welcome

143
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The flower!

144
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I present this beautiful flower to Professor Agni

145
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Super beautiful

146
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't pretend, Grandpa

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Where's the real Professor Titan?

148
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Vega, you have to be polite

149
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry, Grandpa

150
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is impossible!

151
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Professor Titan

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry, Professor

153
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I didn't mean to suspect you

154
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There have been a lot of strange things happening in our school

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If I may know, and if you don't mind

156
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
May I know what's in that cupboard?

157
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ahoy!

158
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That cupboard is filled with Centaurus's baby for my experiment, Professor

159
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Liar!

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Professor Agni, ask him to open it

161
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Professor, may we see the baby Centaurus?

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
If you don't mind

163
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Of course not!

164
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I will be ready to make Professor Agni

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let me go, Alva!

166
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He's not Alva

167
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let me go!

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Mommy, I'm going first

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let me go!

170
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
How can he hold that?

171
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hurry up!

172
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes, yes, yes, be patient!

173
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Be strong! Get that baby!

174
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Let me go!

175
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let me go, Alva!

176
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let me go!

177
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let me go, Alva!

178
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me go!

179
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let me go, Alva!

180
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let me go!

181
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Open the door!

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Professor, Centaurus's baby is so cute

183
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes

184
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No way! This is impossible!

185
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I saw the real Professor Titan!

186
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This is impossible! I saw it myself!

187
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I even helped him!

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Vega, enough!

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's put the baby there

190
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Centaurus's baby, right?

191
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Right!

192
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry, Professor Titan

193
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Maybe Vega is not feeling well

194
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's why he can make up stories like that

195
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not sick, Professor!

196
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Aha!

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're not sick, Vega!

198
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But you're stressed and nervous

199
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes, you're the one who always studies, right?

200
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's fine! I'm not stressed and nervous!

201
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, I'm not!

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're lying!

203
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Vega, enough!

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay, then, Professor

205
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We'll leave now

206
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes

207
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Excuse me

208
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes, Professor

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Professor!

210
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Vega, you're embarrassing me!

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not lying, Professor!

212
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I saw it myself!

213
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He's a bad guy! A liar!

214
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And he's a fake!

215
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Enough, Vega!

216
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're overreacting!

217
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If we do this, it'll be called a slander

218
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you understand?

219
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No, Professor

220
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm sure that Professor Titan is hiding something from him

221
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Enough, Vega!

222
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You should focus on the competition

223
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You should support Alpha

224
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Because he needs your support

225
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
How can I convince Professor Agni?

226
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sure that Professor Titan is hiding somewhere else

227
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry, Professor

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm sorry

229
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

230
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can't give up

231
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I have to prove to Professor Agni

232
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That Professor Titan is a fake

233
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But how?

234
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I know!

235
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I know! I have a book!

236
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh no!

237
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There are so many books!

238
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I must have read it for a long time

239
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But it's okay, I can find it

240
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I have to find out where he keeps his book

241
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Let's go

242
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hi!

243
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Give me a smile

244
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's him again!

245
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh no!

246
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I thought he's not here

247
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He will definitely investigate me

248
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He's the only one who doesn't trust me

249
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh no!

250
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The most perfect conspiracy

251
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Maybe this is the book!

252
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There's a most perfect conspiracy

253
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is a very difficult black magic

254
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Only controlled by a very powerful evil sorcerer

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm sure this is the book's guide

256
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes!

257
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's only one way to prove it

258
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Which is by using...

259
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The book!

260
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The book flew away!

261
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The book!

262
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hey!

263
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What are you doing?

264
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Come here!

265
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The book!

266
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm going to give it to Professor Agni!

267
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't go!

268
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The book!

269
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Po-po-party!

270
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The book!

271
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Where's the book?

272
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The book!

273
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm going to give it to Professor Agni!

274
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The book! Don't go!

275
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh no!

276
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The book!

277
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Why is it so heavy?

278
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The book!

279
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What is this?

280
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's wrong, Po-po?

281
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's not hitting me

282
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Po-po, wait!

283
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm going to find out about the spell!

284
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Ouch, it hurts!

285
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why is it still in the toilet?

286
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll give you a smile!

287
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Feel this, Kwek!

288
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I still have a lot of other jobs!

289
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Bye!

290
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The book!

291
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What are you waiting for?

292
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The book!

293
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm not smart anymore!

294
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I can't do this anymore!

295
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm going to kill you!

296
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Get ready, Kwek!

297
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The time will come!

298
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Tom, hurry up!

299
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The time will come!

300
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Tom, help me!

301
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I can't reach it!

302
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Hurry up, Tom!

303
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The time will come!

304
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Help me!

305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hurry up!

306
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Help me!

307
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Ouch!

308
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's weird!

309
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Why is this place different from the other one?

310
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What's going on?

311
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Ouch!

312
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We can do this!

313
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's a trap!

314
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Where's Rafa?

315
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
This is dangerous!

316
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
SOS!

317
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Where is he? Who is he?

318
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Where is he from?

319
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I just got out of the fridge.

320
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Hurry up, Sata!

321
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He's still not here.

322
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm getting SOS!

323
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
He's dangerous!

324
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He's going to be a bad guy!

325
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What should we do?

326
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Agni, take care of the kids.

327
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes, sir.

328
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm coming with you!

329
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Hold on!

330
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Everyone is watching the competition.

331
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm the king of this place.

332
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Where did he hide the stone?

333
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Here it is.

334
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
A very special stone.

335
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I've got the soul stone.

336
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I can destroy this school!

337
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Tommy, what's wrong?

338
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You're the one who made the SOS sign.

339
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes, sir.

340
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I made the SOS sign.

341
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because...

342
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Because the ticket is gone.

343
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And the alpha is gone, too.

344
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm going to destroy this school!

345
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We were holding the trophy.

346
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Then, there was a strong wind.

347
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We appeared in another place.

348
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Then, there was a raptor.

349
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It attacked me.

350
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Then, I brought the wind.

351
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And I came back here.

352
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But, the alpha didn't come back here.

353
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's it, sir.

354
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
How could it be?

355
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
How did you move the place?

356
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't understand, either.

357
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What's this, sir?

358
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It seems like someone changed the trophy...

359
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
...into a moving tool.

360
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The tool moved the alpha to another place.

361
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't know where it is.

362
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
How come Tommy can come back? But, the alpha can't.

363
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It seems like this person just wants the alpha.

364
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's why he turned Tommy back.

365
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It must be made by Professor Titan.

366
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I think he did this to hurt the alpha.

367
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's not what you said.

368
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
A professor should teach the new students.

369
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So, why did he hurt the alpha?

370
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He just met the alpha.

371
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm sure.

372
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
There's a fake Professor Titan.

373
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And the real one is hidden in his room.

374
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Are you sure?

375
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yes, I'm sure.

376
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
He's wearing a shadow.

377
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Actually, he's the Dark Knight.

378
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:10,000
How could you know that he's the Dark Knight?

379
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Because I saw his shadow in the school mirror.

380
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The Dark Knight

381
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I think you're right, Vega.

382
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
He changed the universe...

383
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
...with the greatest transformation.

384
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yes, Professor.

385
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
His magic is so powerful.

386
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I poured water on him, but he didn't change.

387
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Maybe, this is the same magic as the one in the army.

388
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The only weakness is the mirror.

389
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I don't know.

390
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You're so naive.

391
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We were taught how to transform by the army.

392
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The only weakness is the mirror.

393
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So, if we look at the mirror, we can see the real one.

394
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I have to check everything.

395
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yes, Professor. We have to go to school.

396
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We have to ask Professor Titan where he hid the alpha.

397
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Vega.

398
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm still smiling.

399
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I've installed all the grenades.

400
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Soon, there will be a huge fire festival here.

401
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The Dark Knight

402
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What's going on?

403
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The Dark Knight

404
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What's this?

405
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Professor.

406
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Professor, I think someone is attacking our school.

407
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Our school?

408
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We have to evacuate the children.

409
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yes, Professor.

410
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Vega, run.

411
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Enjoy this mess, Aldebaran.

412
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You're crazy.

413
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Normal.

414
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The Dark Knight

415
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:28,000
With this blood, my power will be perfect.

416
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And soon, I will rule the world.

417
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The Dark Knight

418
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:52,000
This is my wife.

419
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Our school is on fire.

420
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We have to go to school.

421
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Where can we go to school?

422
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
What if our school is closed?

423
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Jack, don't say that.

424
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What if we can't go to school?

425
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yes, that's right.

426
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But, that's just a rumor.

427
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Professor Titan.

428
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
What's that sound?

429
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Professor Titan, stay away from this wall.

430
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I will destroy it.

431
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Destroy it.

432
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Thank you, Professor Titan.

433
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Thank you very much.

434
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You're welcome.

435
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
We have to get out of here.

436
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Let's go.

437
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Aldebaran.

438
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Professor Titan.

439
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Please, look at me.

440
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I found Professor Titan behind the wall.

441
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
In this room.

442
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Behind the wall?

443
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yes.

444
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The Dark Knight is haunting me.

445
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
He even possessed my soul.

446
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, Vega's story is true.

447
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What do you mean?

448
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Vega told me...

449
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
...that Professor Titan is fake.

450
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And the real one is hidden in the closet.

451
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But...

452
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I didn't believe him.

453
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You mean, that girl...

454
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Vega is not lying.

455
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
He helped me once.

456
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But the Dark Knight is stronger.

457
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I was captured again.

458
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And Vega was made to faint.

459
00:38:43,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Here we go.

460
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
[Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

461
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's so scary.

462
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'll kill you.

463
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Take that.

464
00:39:35,000 --> 00:40:05,000
[Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

465
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Why is he gone?

466
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I think he's just after my blood.

467
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
No, no.

468
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Hey, wait!

469
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What?

470
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
The school is on fire.

471
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Why is there always a problem in this school?

472
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Stop it.

473
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You can't change the situation.

474
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Let's just look for Alva.

475
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What?

476
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What do we look for?

477
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The telescope.

478
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Hello.

479
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The telescope is inside the school.

480
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You want me to go there?

481
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I can burn the telescope.

482
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Hello, you can use your magic.

483
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What about you?

484
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Hurry up.

485
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I got the telescope.

486
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's a tsunami!

487
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Freeze!

488
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Flow!

489
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Come here.

490
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm going to look for Alva.

491
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I haven't opened it yet.

492
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Did you find her?

493
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Not yet.

494
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm still concentrating.

495
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No, I'm concentrating.

496
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I think the telescope is broken because of the fire.

497
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And what do we look for at the door?

498
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What do we use?

499
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Raptor.

500
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's so fast.

501
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
How do I follow it?

502
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I have to use another way.

503
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm going to use this.

504
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I forgot to turn it on.

505
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Where's the lollipop?

506
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
This is good.

507
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm going to look for the lollipop.

508
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's so easy.

509
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There it is!

510
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I found the lollipop.

511
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's easy to control.

512
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Why did the raptor stop?

513
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm going to stop too.

514
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Stop!

515
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The raptor is still alive.

516
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Raptor.

517
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You've done what I told you to do.

518
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You've got Alva's tender.

519
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I've succeeded.

520
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Very good.

521
00:43:46,000 --> 00:44:09,000
A perfect plan.

522
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's true.

523
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Your plan to turn me into a raptor...

524
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
...is amazing.

525
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Angkara!

526
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yes, sir.

527
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Angkara.

528
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I want you to turn into a raptor.

529
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
What for?

530
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The ring I have...

531
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
...is now owned by Alva.

532
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And she can't be attacked.

533
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
In fact, my attack will turn me back.

534
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That's why I want you to turn into a raptor.

535
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Because that ring...

536
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
...won't work...

537
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
...if you use my body.

538
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm going to turn you into a raptor.

539
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Turn into him.

540
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yes, sir.

541
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:22,000
How is my attack, sir?

542
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Good, Angkara.

543
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Perfect.

544
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Raptor.

545
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Go back to your place.

546
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Now...

547
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
...take Alva's blood.

548
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,000
But the best part is...

549
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
...you turned into Professor Titan.

550
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Everything was easily fooled.

551
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Even Alva.

552
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes, sir.

553
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm sorry, sir.

554
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So, the raptor...

556
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The raptor is Professor Angkara?

557
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
A perfect deception.

558
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Even Aldebaran was fooled.

559
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But there's one person who wasn't.

560
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Vega.

561
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But we don't have to worry.

562
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Because no one believes in him.

563
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Even...

564
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
...he was blamed by his own teacher.

565
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Professor Titan.

566
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So, Professor Titan is the raptor?

567
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Professor T...

568
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Professor Titan is a raptor?

569
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Then, I was attacked.

570
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
What? I woke up from my dream.

571
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Ang...

572
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So, I think...

573
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
...Professor Titan has something to do with the dark side.

574
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Vega is right.

575
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But I and Re Tole...

576
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
...don't believe in Vega.

577
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm mad at Vega.

578
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm sorry, Vega.

579
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't believe in you anymore.

580
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Actually, I'm more confident...

581
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
...that all of this can be avoided.

582
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
With this blood.

583
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
My power will be perfect.

584
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And soon...

585
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I will rule the world.

586
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What should I do now?

587
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:22,000
To be continued...

588
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Tara!

589
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Tara, I need your help.

590
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
What's wrong?

591
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Help me!

592
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm not dead yet!

593
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Help me!

594
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Professor Titan is here!

595
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Help me!

596
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Fire! Fire! Help me!

597
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Help me!

598
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:24,000
How long will this conspiracy last, sir?

599
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Soon, sir.

600
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Soon, the conspiracy will be ready.

601
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And I will get the perfect power.

602
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The unlimited power!

603
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
We have to help Mrs. Bertiwi!

604
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But how, Vega?

605
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The fire is too big.

606
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
If we go in, we can burn.

607
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Open the gate!

608
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Fire! Fire! Help me!

609
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
How?

610
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Sir!

611
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Let us help Mrs. Bertiwi!

612
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But you're tired of being together.

613
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You can't help her.

614
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let us help her.

615
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Yes, sir. Let us help her.

616
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
We're special kids. We want to help.

617
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Okay.

618
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But be careful.

619
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You're just a kid.

620
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'll help you.

621
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
No, don't.

622
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
There are three of us.

623
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
We might be late. Let's go.

624
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Wait for me.

625
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Bye.

626
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Be careful, sir.

627
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Don't come near me.

628
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
What's that?

629
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Help!

630
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Be careful, sir!

631
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
They're being attacked.

632
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm scared!

633
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Help me!

634
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Calm down.

635
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I'll help Ray and Toleh.

636
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Wait.

637
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Let me and Prof. Titan help Mrs. Bertiwi.

638
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Smile, Prof. Agni.

639
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Leave it to me.

640
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I can handle it myself.

641
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Help me!

642
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Jump, Mrs. Bertiwi!

643
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
No!

644
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's dangerous!

645
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Jump!

646
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I'll catch you from here.

647
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
No!

648
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
What if my face is burnt?

649
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I'm scared.

650
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
If you don't jump, you'll be burnt.

651
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
No!

652
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm going to be burnt.

653
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It's time.

654
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
This conspiracy...

655
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
is mixed with a trap.

656
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I can't wait, sir.

657
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I'm here.

658
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Alva!

659
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Give me back the bottle.

660
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
How dare you take the bottle from me?

661
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Give it back!

662
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Why not?

663
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's clear.

664
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
This is my tears, sweat, and blood.

665
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So, this is my business.

666
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
The point is,

667
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
you're chasing me.

668
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm not going to let you go.

669
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I won't let you win.

670
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:40,000
The water is running out!

671
00:53:40,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Why are you disturbing me?

672
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I can't just stand here.

673
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I have to help the dark side.

674
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'm here.

675
00:54:38,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Help!

676
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Drink it, Hera.

677
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And get the power.

678
00:55:13,000 --> 00:56:00,000
What's that?

679
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Alva.

680
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
You're going to lose this time.

681
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Because the dark side...

682
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
will soon come to an end.

683
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You're going to lose!

684
00:56:41,000 --> 00:57:25,000
To be continued...

685
00:57:49,000 --> 00:58:09,000
We can do this!

686
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Now...

687
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
My power has increased.

688
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
The dark side is very strong.

689
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
No one can defeat me.

690
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Including you, Alva.

691
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Good luck.

692
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Hey!

693
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Let go of his hand.

694
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
So I can help you from below.

695
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Come on, let go of him.

696
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay, let's just let him go.

697
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Be careful, the soldiers are catching us.

698
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Okay, let's count to three.

699
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
One.

700
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Two.

701
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Three.

702
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
He's here.

703
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:27,000
What's wrong with him?

704
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Thank you, Wikendara.

705
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Thank you, Tindara.

706
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
No, help me!

707
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Come on, Doctor. Please, jump!

708
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
If you don't, you'll get burned!

709
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
What? Jump? Are you crazy?

710
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
No, no, no!

711
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Please, pull! Hurry!

712
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Hurry! Jump!

713
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
We did it!

714
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It doesn't hurt.

715
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It's amazing!

716
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's okay, Doctor.

717
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
But I'm a bit dizzy.

718
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I'm sorry, Professor!

719
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
What happened? Are you okay?

720
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Professor, are you okay?

721
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
What's wrong?

722
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Professor?

723
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I'm so sorry!

724
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'm sorry!

725
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:56,000
The damage is severe.

726
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The soul stone is gone.

727
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Maybe the dark energy took it.

728
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
What?

729
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Professor Lodebaran, what about the damage to the school?

730
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Is it severe?

731
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
The damage is not a problem.

732
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
We can always build this school with the power of magic.

733
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
But now, there's a bigger problem.

734
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The Dark Lord has stolen the soul stone from my room.

735
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
What?

736
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
With the soul stone,

737
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the Dark Lord will be hard to defeat.

738
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
He can split his soul into 12 parts...

739
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and put each part in a different place.

740
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Because of that, he will be very hard to defeat.

741
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Unless we can destroy all 12 parts of the stone.

742
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Evil power!

743
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:52,000
What's that?

744
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Evil power!

745
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
What's that?

747

What's that?

01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Now, I will split you into 12 parts.

01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's useless, Alva.

751
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
This ring has no effect on me now.

752
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Because my power now...

753
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
is much greater.

754
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:37,000
What's that?

755
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's a whip!

I... I have to survive.

With these 12 souls,

I will divide my soul into 12.
