 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I will make him my son

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I will make him proud

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Is it true, my teacher?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Alva and Tommy, you have to ride your bike into the forest

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And in the forest, you have to catch a ghost

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 After you catch the ghost, you have to bring it to the finish line

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 That's Alva, she made me lose my faith in life

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I will make her lose

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Alva, I'm going right, you go left, let's see who gets the ghost first

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Alva, I'm going right, you go left, let's see who gets the ghost first

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Where is the ghost? I can't find it

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Where is it?

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 It's not here

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Ouch, who threw the black cloth?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 It hurts

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Oh, it's you

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 How are you?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I'm fine

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Do you want to surrender yourself, then I will catch you and bring you to the finish line

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Do you want to? I need your help

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Try to catch me if you can

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Oh, you have been taught the ghost mantra

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 What are you doing, Alva?

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Ghost!

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 That's all? You're so stupid

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I'm going up

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Where are you going?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I missed

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 You're so stupid, you can't catch me

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Run!

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Alva is gone

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Ghost!

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Ghost, sit behind me

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Now I will win

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 My dad has a life fluid

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So if you want to be caught by me, I will give you the life fluid

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 That's right, this time I want to be caught by you, but the life fluid first

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Okay

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Tom, is it true that I was given a life fluid?

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Yes, you're so stupid, just sit down

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I'm sure Alva hasn't caught the ghost yet

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I'm sure I will win

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 My body hurts

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I'm in pain

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Is it here?

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Ghost!

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Oh, I tried to save Professor Titan

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Where is Professor Titan?

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I'm sure he's in the fake Professor Titan's lab

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I told Professor Agni

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I'm late for Alva and Tom's competition

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Professor Agni!

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Yes, Vega?

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 It's so scary

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Vega, you didn't watch the competition?

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 There's something more important than the competition

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 What is it, Vega?

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Professor Titan

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 What about Professor Titan?

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Professor Titan, who has been in our school, is fake

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 He's the eighth ghost

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 The eighth ghost?

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Yes, Professor

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 The real Professor Titan is hidden in the closet

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I saw it myself, Prof

83
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I even helped Professor Titan

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 But when I didn't help him, the ghost attacked me again

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Are you sure about this, Vega?

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Yes, Prof

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 That's why Professor followed me until we saw it together

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Let's go, Prof

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Where is the ghost?

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 How could it just disappear?

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I can't see the other ghosts

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Raya, where are you?

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Raya, don't disappear!

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I feel sorry for you, you haven't got the ghost yet

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I already got the ghost

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I'm going to win now

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Bye

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Bye, Prof

99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Bye, Prof

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Don't come in!

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 That's why you shouldn't tease people

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I'll look for the ghost again

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 So I can win

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I'm going to win

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 You're the one who should be the one to ride the bike, not me

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 It hurts

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 You're always angry, that's why it hurts

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Let's just rest here

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Where is it? I haven't seen it

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Where is it?

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Let's look for it

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Poor Raya

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 She's so brave

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Even though our job is to catch her

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 She's a ghost

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I'm going to catch it

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 There it is!

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 There it is!

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Where is it?

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 You're done, Alva

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 The ghost is hiding

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 You won't get the ghost

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Here it is

124
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 There's a life line!

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Raybounty, there's a life line!

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 There's a life line!

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Hey!

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Alva, where's the life line?

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Give it to me

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Here it is

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Ghost!

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I'm going to pull it

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 You can't go anywhere now

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Alva, you lied to me

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Let me go

136
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Move!

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Let's go inside

138
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Don't, Vega. That's not nice

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 We should make sure it's true

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Professor Titan

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Excuse me, Professor Titan

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Professor Titan

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Yes, please come in

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Professor!

145
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I'm sorry, Professor

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Ahoy!

147
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Smile, everyone

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 There's a beautiful and talented professor

149
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Professor Agni's presence is not embarrassing

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 But this is a blessing for me, Professor

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Welcome

152
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 The flower!

153
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 I present this beautiful flower to Professor Agni

154
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Super beautiful

155
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Don't pretend, Grandpa

156
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Where's the real Professor Titan?

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Vega, you have to be polite

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I'm sorry, Grandpa

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 I'm sorry, Grandpa

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I'm sorry, Grandpa

161
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 This is impossible!

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 This is impossible!

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 This is impossible!

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 This is impossible!

165
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 This is impossible!

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 This is impossible!

167
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 This is impossible!

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Professor Titan

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I'm sorry, Professor

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I didn't mean to suspect you

171
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 There have been a lot of strange things happening in our school

172
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 If I may know, and if you don't mind

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 May I know what's in that cupboard?

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Ahoy!

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 That cupboard is filled with Centaurus's baby for my experiment, Professor

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Liar!

177
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Professor Agni, ask him to open it

178
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Professor, may we see the baby Centaurus?

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 If you don't mind

180
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Of course not!

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I will be ready to make Professor Agni

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Let me go, Alva!

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Let me go, Alva!

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 He's not Alva

185
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Let me go!

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Mommy, I'm going first

187
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Let me go!

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 How can he hold that?

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Hurry up!

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Yes, yes, yes, be patient!

191
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Be strong! Get that baby!

192
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Let me go!

193
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Let me go, Alva!

194
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Let me go!

195
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Let me go, Alva!

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Let me go!

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Let me go, Alva!

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Let me go!

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Open the door!

200
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Open the door!

201
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Professor, Centaurus's baby is so cute

202
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Yes

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 No way! This is impossible!

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I saw the real Professor Titan!

205
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 This is impossible! I saw it myself!

206
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I even helped him!

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Vega, enough!

208
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Let's put the baby there

209
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Centaurus's baby, right?

210
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Right!

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I'm sorry, Professor Titan

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Maybe Vega is not feeling well

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 That's why he can make up stories like that

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I'm not sick, Professor!

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Aha!

216
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 You're not sick, Vega!

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 But you're stressed and nervous

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Yes, you're the one who always studies, right?

219
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's fine! I'm not stressed and nervous!

220
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 No, I'm not!

221
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 You're lying!

222
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Vega, enough!

223
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Okay, then, Professor

224
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 We'll leave now

225
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Yes

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Excuse me

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Yes, Professor

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Professor!

229
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Vega, you're embarrassing me!

230
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I'm not lying, Professor!

231
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I saw it myself!

232
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 He's a bad guy! A liar!

233
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And he's a fake!

234
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Enough, Vega!

235
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 You're overreacting!

236
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 If we do this, it'll be called a slander

237
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Do you understand?

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 No, Professor

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 I'm sure that Professor Titan is hiding something from him

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Enough, Vega!

241
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 You should focus on the competition

242
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 You should support Alpha

243
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Because he needs your support

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 How can I convince Professor Agni?

245
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 I'm sure that Professor Titan is hiding somewhere else

246
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I'm sure that Professor Titan is hiding somewhere else

247
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I'm sorry, Professor

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 I'm sorry

249
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

250
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

251
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I can't give up

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I have to prove to Professor Agni

254
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 That Professor Titan is a fake

255
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But how?

256
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I know!

257
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I know! I have a book!

258
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Oh no!

259
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 There are so many books!

260
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I must have read it for a long time

261
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 But it's okay, I can find it

262
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I have to find out where he keeps his book

263
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Let's go

264
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Hi!

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Give me a smile

266
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It's him again!

267
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Oh no!

268
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I thought he's not here

269
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 He will definitely investigate me

270
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 He's the only one who doesn't trust me

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Oh no!

272
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 The most perfect conspiracy

273
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Maybe this is the book!

274
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 There's a most perfect conspiracy

275
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 This is a very difficult black magic

276
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Only controlled by a very powerful evil sorcerer

277
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I'm sure this is the book's guide

278
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Yes!

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 There's only one way to prove it

280
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Which is by using...

281
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 The book!

282
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 The book flew away!

283
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 The book!

284
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Hey!

285
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 What are you doing?

286
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Come here!

287
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 The book!

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I'm going to give it to Professor Agni!

289
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Don't go!

290
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 The book!

291
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Po-po-party!

292
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 The book!

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Where's the book?

294
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Where's the book?

295
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 The book!

296
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I'm going to give it to Professor Agni!

297
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 The book! Don't go!

298
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Oh no!

299
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 The book!

300
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Why is it so heavy?

301
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 The book!

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 What is this?

303
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 What's wrong, Po-po?

304
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 It's not hitting me

305
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Po-po, wait!

306
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I'm going to find out about the spell!

307
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Ouch, it hurts!

308
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Why is it still in the toilet?

309
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 I'll give you a smile!

310
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Feel this, Kwek!

311
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I still have a lot of other jobs!

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Bye!

313
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 The book!

314
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 What are you waiting for?

315
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 The book!

316
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 The book!

317
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I'm not smart anymore!

318
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I can't do this anymore!

319
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I can't do this anymore!

320
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I'm going to kill you!

321
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Get ready, Kwek!

322
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 The time will come!

323
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 The time will come!

324
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 The time will come!

325
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Tom, hurry up!

326
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 The time will come!

327
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Tom, help me!

328
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I can't reach it!

329
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Hurry up, Tom!

330
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 The time will come!

331
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 The time will come!

332
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 The time will come!

333
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 The time will come!

334
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 The time will come!

335
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 The time will come!

336
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Help me!

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Hurry up!

338
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Help me!

339
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Help me!

340
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Help me!

341
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Help me!

342
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Ouch!

343
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It's weird!

344
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Why is this place different from the other one?

345
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 What's going on?

346
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Ouch!

347
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Ouch!

348
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Ouch!

349
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 We can do this!

350
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 We can do this!

351
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 We can do this!

352
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 It's a trap!

353
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 It's a trap!

354
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 It's a trap!

355
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 It's a trap!

356
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Where's Rafa?

357
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 This is dangerous!

358
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 SOS!

359
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Where is he? Who is he?

360
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Where is he from?

361
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Where is he from?

362
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I just got out of the fridge.

363
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Hurry up, Sata!

364
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 He's still not here.

365
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 I'm getting SOS!

366
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 He's dangerous!

367
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He's going to be a bad guy!

368
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 What should we do?

369
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Agni, take care of the kids.

370
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Yes, sir.

371
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I'm coming with you!

372
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Hold on!

373
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Everyone is watching the competition.

374
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 I'm the king of this place.

375
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 I'm the king of this place.

376
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Where did he hide the stone?

377
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Where did he hide the stone?

378
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Here it is.

379
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 A very special stone.

380
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 A very special stone.

381
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I've got the soul stone.

382
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 I can destroy this school!

383
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Tommy, what's wrong?

384
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 You're the one who made the SOS sign.

385
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Yes, sir.

386
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I made the SOS sign.

387
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Because...

388
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Because the ticket is gone.

389
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And the alpha is gone, too.

390
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 I'm going to destroy this school!

391
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I'm going to destroy this school!

392
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I'm going to destroy this school!

393
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I'm going to destroy this school!

394
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 We were holding the trophy.

395
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Then, there was a strong wind.

396
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 We appeared in another place.

397
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Then, there was a raptor.

398
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 It attacked me.

399
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Then, I brought the wind.

400
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And I came back here.

401
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 But, the alpha didn't come back here.

402
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 That's it, sir.

403
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 How could it be?

404
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 How did you move the place?

405
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I don't understand, either.

406
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 What's this, sir?

407
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It seems like someone changed the trophy...

408
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 ...into a moving tool.

409
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 The tool moved the alpha to another place.

410
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 I don't know where it is.

411
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 How come Tommy can come back? But, the alpha can't.

412
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 It seems like this person just wants the alpha.

413
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 That's why he turned Tommy back.

414
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 It must be made by Professor Titan.

415
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 I think he did this to hurt the alpha.

416
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's not what you said.

417
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 A professor should teach the new students.

418
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 So, why did he hurt the alpha?

419
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 He just met the alpha.

420
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 I'm sure.

421
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 There's a fake Professor Titan.

422
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And the real one is hidden in his room.

423
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Are you sure?

424
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Yes, I'm sure.

425
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 He's wearing a shadow.

426
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Actually, he's the Dark Knight.

427
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 How could you know that he's the Dark Knight?

428
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Because I saw his shadow in the school mirror.

429
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 The Dark Knight

430
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 I think you're right, Vega.

431
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 He changed the universe...

432
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 ...with the greatest transformation.

433
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Yes, Professor.

434
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 His magic is so powerful.

435
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 I poured water on him, but he didn't change.

436
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Maybe, this is the same magic as the one in the army.

437
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 The only weakness is the mirror.

438
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 I don't know.

439
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 You're so naive.

440
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 We were taught how to transform by the army.

441
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 The only weakness is the mirror.

442
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 So, if we look at the mirror, we can see the real one.

443
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 I have to check everything.

444
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Yes, Professor. We have to go to school.

445
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 We have to ask Professor Titan where he hid the alpha.

446
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Vega.

447
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Vega.

448
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I'm still smiling.

449
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I've installed all the grenades.

450
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Soon, there will be a huge fire festival here.

451
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 The Dark Knight

452
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 What's going on?

453
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 The Dark Knight

454
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 What's this?

455
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 What's this?

456
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Professor.

457
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Professor.

458
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Professor, I think someone is attacking our school.

459
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Our school?

460
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 We have to evacuate the children.

461
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Yes, Professor.

462
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Vega, run.

463
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Enjoy this mess, Aldebaran.

464
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 You're crazy.

465
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Normal.

466
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 The Dark Knight

467
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 With this blood, my power will be perfect.

468
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And soon, I will rule the world.

469
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 The Dark Knight

470
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 The Dark Knight

471
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 This is my wife.

472
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Our school is on fire.

473
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 We have to go to school.

474
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Where can we go to school?

475
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 What if our school is closed?

476
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Jack, don't say that.

477
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 What if we can't go to school?

478
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Yes, that's right.

479
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 But, that's just a rumor.

480
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Professor Titan.

481
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Professor Titan.

482
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Professor Titan.

483
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Professor Titan.

484
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Professor Titan.

485
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Professor Titan.

486
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Professor Titan.

487
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Professor Titan.

488
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 What's that sound?

489
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Professor Titan, stay away from this wall.

490
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 I will destroy it.

491
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Destroy it.

492
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Destroy it.

493
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Destroy it.

494
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Thank you, Professor Titan.

495
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Thank you very much.

496
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 You're welcome.

497
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 We have to get out of here.

498
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Let's go.

499
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Aldebaran.

500
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Professor Titan.

501
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Please, look at me.

502
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 I found Professor Titan behind the wall.

503
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 In this room.

504
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Behind the wall?

505
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Yes.

506
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 The Dark Knight is haunting me.

507
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 He even possessed my soul.

508
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 So, Vega's story is true.

509
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 What do you mean?

510
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Vega told me...

511
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 ...that Professor Titan is fake.

512
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 And the real one is hidden in the closet.

513
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 But...

514
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I didn't believe him.

515
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 You mean, that girl...

516
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Vega is not lying.

517
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 He helped me once.

518
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 But the Dark Knight is stronger.

519
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 I was captured again.

520
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 And Vega was made to faint.

521
00:38:43,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Here we go.

522
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 [Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

523
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 It's so scary.

524
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 It's so scary.

525
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 I'll kill you.

526
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Take that.

527
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 [Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

528
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 [Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

529
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 [Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

530
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 [Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

531
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 [Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

532
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 [Vega is now possessed by the Dark Knight]

533
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Why is he gone?

534
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 I think he's just after my blood.

535
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 No, no.

536
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Hey, wait!

537
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 What?

538
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 The school is on fire.

539
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Why is there always a problem in this school?

540
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Stop it.

541
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 You can't change the situation.

542
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Let's just look for Alva.

543
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 What?

544
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 What do we look for?

545
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 The telescope.

546
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Hello.

547
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 The telescope is inside the school.

548
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 You want me to go there?

549
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 I can burn the telescope.

550
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Hello, you can use your magic.

551
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 What about you?

552
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Hurry up.

553
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 I got the telescope.

554
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 It's a tsunami!

555
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Freeze!

556
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Flow!

557
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 Come here.

558
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 I'm going to look for Alva.

559
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 I'm going to look for Alva.

560
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 I haven't opened it yet.

561
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Did you find her?

562
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Not yet.

563
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 I'm still concentrating.

564
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 No, I'm concentrating.

565
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 I think the telescope is broken because of the fire.

566
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And what do we look for at the door?

567
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 What do we use?

568
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Raptor.

569
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 It's so fast.

570
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 How do I follow it?

571
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 I have to use another way.

572
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 I'm going to use this.

573
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 I forgot to turn it on.

574
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Where's the lollipop?

575
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 This is good.

576
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 I'm going to look for the lollipop.

577
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 It's so easy.

578
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 There it is!

579
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 I found the lollipop.

580
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 It's easy to control.

581
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Why did the raptor stop?

582
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 I'm going to stop too.

583
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Stop!

584
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 The raptor is still alive.

585
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Raptor.

586
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 You've done what I told you to do.

587
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 You've got Alva's tender.

588
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 I've succeeded.

589
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Very good.

590
00:43:46,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 A perfect plan.

591
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 It's true.

592
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Your plan to turn me into a raptor...

593
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 ...is amazing.

594
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Angkara!

595
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Yes, sir.

596
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 Angkara.

597
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 I want you to turn into a raptor.

598
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 What for?

599
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 The ring I have...

600
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 ...is now owned by Alva.

601
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 And she can't be attacked.

602
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 In fact, my attack will turn me back.

603
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 That's why I want you to turn into a raptor.

604
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 Because that ring...

605
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 ...won't work...

606
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 ...if you use my body.

607
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 I'm going to turn you into a raptor.

608
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 Turn into him.

609
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Yes, sir.

610
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 How is my attack, sir?

611
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Good, Angkara.

612
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Perfect.

613
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 Raptor.

614
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Go back to your place.

615
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Now...

616
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 ...take Alva's blood.

617
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 But the best part is...

618
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 ...you turned into Professor Titan.

619
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Everything was easily fooled.

620
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Even Alva.

621
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Yes, sir.

622
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 I'm sorry, sir.

623
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 I'm sorry.

624
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 So, the raptor...

625
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 The raptor is Professor Angkara?

626
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 A perfect deception.

627
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Even Aldebaran was fooled.

628
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 But there's one person who wasn't.

629
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 Vega.

630
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 But we don't have to worry.

631
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Because no one believes in him.

632
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Even...

633
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 ...he was blamed by his own teacher.

634
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Professor Titan.

635
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 So, Professor Titan is the raptor?

636
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 Professor T...

637
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Professor Titan is a raptor?

638
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Then, I was attacked.

639
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 What? I woke up from my dream.

640
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 Ang...

641
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 So, I think...

642
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 ...Professor Titan has something to do with the dark side.

643
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Vega is right.

644
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 But I and Re Tole...

645
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 ...don't believe in Vega.

646
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 I'm mad at Vega.

647
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I'm sorry, Vega.

648
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 I don't believe in you anymore.

649
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 Actually, I'm more confident...

650
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 ...that all of this can be avoided.

651
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 With this blood.

652
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 My power will be perfect.

653
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 And soon...

654
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 I will rule the world.

655
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 What should I do now?

656
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 To be continued...

657
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 To be continued...

658
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 To be continued...

659
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 To be continued...

660
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 To be continued...

661
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 To be continued...

662
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 Tara!

663
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 Tara, I need your help.

664
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 What's wrong?

665
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 Help me!

666
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 I'm not dead yet!

667
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 Help me!

668
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 Professor Titan is here!

669
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 Professor Titan is here!

670
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Help me!

671
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 Fire! Fire! Help me!

672
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 Help me!

673
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 Help me!

674
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Help me!

675
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Help me!

676
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 Help me!

677
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 Help me!

678
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 How long will this conspiracy last, sir?

679
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Soon, sir.

680
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Soon, the conspiracy will be ready.

681
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 And I will get the perfect power.

682
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 The unlimited power!

683
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 We have to help Mrs. Bertiwi!

684
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 But how, Vega?

685
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 The fire is too big.

686
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 If we go in, we can burn.

687
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 Open the gate!

688
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 Fire! Fire! Help me!

689
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 How?

690
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 Sir!

691
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Let us help Mrs. Bertiwi!

692
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 But you're tired of being together.

693
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 You can't help her.

694
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Let us help her.

695
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 Yes, sir. Let us help her.

696
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 We're special kids. We want to help.

697
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 Okay.

698
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 But be careful.

699
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 You're just a kid.

700
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 I'll help you.

701
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 No, don't.

702
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 There are three of us.

703
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 We might be late. Let's go.

704
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 Wait for me.

705
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 Bye.

706
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 Be careful, sir.

707
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 Be careful, sir.

708
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 Don't come near me.

709
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Don't come near me.

710
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 What's that?

711
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 Help!

712
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 Help!

713
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 Help!

714
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 Be careful, sir!

715
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 They're being attacked.

716
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 I'm scared!

717
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 Help me!

718
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 Help me!

719
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 Calm down.

720
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 I'll help Ray and Toleh.

721
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 Wait.

722
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 Let me and Prof. Titan help Mrs. Bertiwi.

723
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 Smile, Prof. Agni.

724
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 Leave it to me.

725
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 I can handle it myself.

726
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 Help me!

727
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 Jump, Mrs. Bertiwi!

728
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 No!

729
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 It's dangerous!

730
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 Jump!

731
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 I'll catch you from here.

732
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 No!

733
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 What if my face is burnt?

734
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 I'm scared.

735
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 If you don't jump, you'll be burnt.

736
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 No!

737
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 I'm going to be burnt.

738
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 It's time.

739
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 This conspiracy...

740
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 is mixed with a trap.

741
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 I can't wait, sir.

742
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 I'm here.

743
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 Alva!

744
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 Alva!

745
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 Give me back the bottle.

746
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 How dare you take the bottle from me?

747
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Give it back!

748
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Why not?

749
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 It's clear.

750
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 This is my tears, sweat, and blood.

751
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 So, this is my business.

752
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 The point is,

753
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 you're chasing me.

754
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 I'm not going to let you go.

755
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 I won't let you win.

756
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 The water is running out!

757
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 The water is running out!

758
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 The water is running out!

759
00:53:40,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 Why are you disturbing me?

760
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 I can't just stand here.

761
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 I have to help the dark side.

762
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 I'm here.

763
00:54:38,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 Help!

764
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Help!

765
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 Drink it, Hera.

766
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 And get the power.

767
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 What's that?

768
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000

779
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 Alva.

780
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 You're going to lose this time.

781
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 Because the dark side...

782
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000

783
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000

 We can do this!

797
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 Now...

798
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 My power has increased.

799
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 The dark side is very strong.

800
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 No one can defeat me.

801
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000

802
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 Good luck.

803
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 Hey!

804
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 Let go of his hand.

805
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 So I can help you from below.

806
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 Come on, let go of him.

807
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 Okay, let's just let him go.

808
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 Be careful, the soldiers are catching us.

809
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Okay, let's count to three.

810
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 One.

811
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000

812
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000

813
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 He's here.

814
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 What's wrong with him?

815
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 Thank you, Wikendara.

816
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Thank you, Tindara.

817
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 No, help me!

818
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 Come on, Doctor. Please, jump!

819
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 If you don't, you'll get burned!

820
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 What? Jump? Are you crazy?

821
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 No, no, no!

822
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 Please, pull! Hurry!

823
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 Hurry! Jump!

824
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 We did it!

825
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 It doesn't hurt.

826
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 It's amazing!

827
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,000
 It's okay, Doctor.

828
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 But I'm a bit dizzy.

829
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 I'm sorry, Professor!

830
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
 What happened? Are you okay?

831
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 Professor, are you okay?

832
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 What's wrong?

833
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 Professor?

834
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 I'm so sorry!

835
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 I'm sorry!

836
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 I'm sorry!

837
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 I'm sorry!

838
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:56,000
 The damage is severe.

839
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 The soul stone is gone.

840
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 Maybe the dark energy took it.

841
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 What?

842
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:25,000
 Professor Lodebaran, what about the damage to the school?

843
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Is it severe?

844
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 The damage is not a problem.

845
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 We can always build this school with the power of magic.

846
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
 But now, there's a bigger problem.

847
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
 The Dark Lord has stolen the soul stone from my room.

848
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 What?

849
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 With the soul stone,

850
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 the Dark Lord will be hard to defeat.

851
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 He can split his soul into 12 parts...

852
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 and put each part in a different place.

853
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 Because of that, he will be very hard to defeat.

854
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
 Unless we can destroy all 12 parts of the stone.

855
