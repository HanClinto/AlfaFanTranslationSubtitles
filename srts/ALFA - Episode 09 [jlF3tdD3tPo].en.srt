The monster likes chocolate

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How can a cruel monster like chocolate?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have to destroy all the chocolates in the village

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If necessary, destroy all the chocolate trees there

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The monster is coming

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The monster is great

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The monster is not dead, it just escaped

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the monster can come back?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It can come back if it smells chocolate

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The chocolate is in my hand

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And you tell Alfa

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If Alfa still wants this child to live

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then she has to give up

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The flute played by the dark craftsman

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Makes the monster calm, becomes a beast

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You teach the flute, okay?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, I'll teach

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Seriously?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Even though you don't like it, even though you force it

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Eat it, Momo

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Professor, Professor

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong, Vega?

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alfa went back to the village

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's wrong with Alfa?

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because the news said Professor Ankara kidnapped her

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And Professor Ankara said Alfa has to go there

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No one will accompany her, she has to be alone

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If not, the news will be spoiled

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm in a hurry, I'll go after Alfa

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't let Ankara take Alfa

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll go too, Prof

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I have to go save Alfa

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If Ankara gets there

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If Alfa gets a single hair on her head

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll tear her body apart

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll go with you, Prof

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can go with me

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But there's a condition

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What condition?

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Miphi is Vega's daughter

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why is Professor Ankara a demon?

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That means we're going to be like this

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What? We're going to be small?

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes, we're going to be small

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:17,000
With you being small like this

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It'll be easier for me to hold your hands

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry, Prof

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm Megantara Ankara

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wow, Professor's clothes smell so good

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
[Megantara Ankara]

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Eat this, Vega

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wow, a demon's toy

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That toy won't run out in a week

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you, Professor

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm stuck

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm stuck, Prof

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Professor!

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm stuck, Prof!

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Chicken satay and fermented fish

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Relax, man

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's still a long way

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's still a long way?

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can't breathe here

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm going to die

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Tara!

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm coming!

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Tara, when is the last time you took a shower?

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
For me, cleanliness is number one

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The last time I took a shower was three weeks ago

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Huh? Three weeks ago?

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Tara! I'm so hungry!

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Excuse me

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Professor, I'm so glad you came

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Please help me, Professor

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Plita was kidnapped! Please, Professor!

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, I know

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's why we came here together

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you, Professor

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sure you can find Plita

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come on, Professor

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll show you my way

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Come on, Professor

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Ouch!

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not like that, Alfa!

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You taught me!

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sorry, I'm learning too

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll try again

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
[Siren]

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Enough!

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're always wrong!

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You should just continue!

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're going to fail!

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Not like that, Pooh!

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll try again!

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
[Siren]

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Where is she?

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, you're right!

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Because of you, I'm sure she's dancing with the music

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Hooray! I did it!

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes! Hooray! I did it!

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hooray! Yes! Yes!

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Thank you! Thank you for teaching me!

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you!

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Huh?

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Pooh is hugged?

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Usually, all gods treat Pooh with love

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Pooh, why are you crying?

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Huh?

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, no!

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Please, just a little bit!

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, you can do it!

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go to the cave!

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, let's go!

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's go there!

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, let's go!

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Galaxy, are you still there?

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We're still going straight there, Sir

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Felita!

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh my God, I'm leading Felita!

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Poor thing, she's still alone there!

135
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Felita, it's me! Can you hear me?

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why did you hide me, Sir?

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm so scared, it's so dark here, Sir!

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Stay there, I'll hide you, Pooh!

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What's going on?

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why did you suddenly hide me, Sir?

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sir!

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Shut up!

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now, you can't talk to a kid anymore!

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've never been through that road with my dad!

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's full of rocks and dark, Sir!

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Please, help me, Sir!

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm going to use that mirror without my permission!

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Felita!

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Professor!

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Professor Edelberen!

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think this is not the right way!

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Galaxy, who's actually leading Felita?

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Alcara, Sir!

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How do you know?

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wasn't that the news in the room?

156
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And why did you bring us on this journey?

157
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Shouldn't you be taking us on a rocky road?

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you actually know the right way?

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know, Sir.

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Unfortunately, you're too late to know that.

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This is the sand of the sandstorm!

162
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're right, Sir!

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The sandstorm is a sign of magic.

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
All the magic is here!

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

166
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't take you to the magic.

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Only Alfa can go there.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Galaxy!

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Where is it?

170
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Popo, it's still far away.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's over there.

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, let's go there.

173
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Be careful!

174
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
[Scream]

175
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's over there.

176
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Popo, thank you for saving me.

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's go.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Professor, it's over there!

179
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm so angry!

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Ray, Vega, help me!

181
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Help me, don't just stand there!

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You find a rope or something that can help them.

183
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hurry up!

184
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We have to go, Sir!

185
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Come on, Ray!

186
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We're almost there.

187
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Come on, keep going!

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Keep going!

189
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Megatara.

190
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hold on, Megatara.

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
[Scream]

192
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank God, we're safe.

193
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Vega, Ray, thank you.

194
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You two have saved us.

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're welcome, Sir.

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Right, Sir?

197
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's not a loss if you bring me and Vega.

198
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why, Galaxy?

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why did you do that?

200
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's none of your business, Professor.

201
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why, Galaxy?

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why?

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I was threatened by these backwards.

205
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
If every news they send is just a lie,

206
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't want to lose the news, Professor.

207
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

208
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Galaxy.

209
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But you know...

210
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
where the real treasure is, right?

211
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I know, Professor.

212
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Come on.

213
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll show you the way.

214
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So, how do we get in?

215
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I know how to open the door.

216
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And then?

217
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,000
[Chanting]

218
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Come on, Popo.

219
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm scared.

220
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If I'm still there,

221
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll be killed by Professor Ankara.

222
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because I've betrayed him.

223
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If you're scared, you don't have to go in.

224
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let me go in alone.

225
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't.

226
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Even though I don't want to.

227
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Even though I'm suffering.

228
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I have to go in.

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Alright, I'll go in.

230
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But you have to be careful.

231
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Alright.

232
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm not a ghost!

233
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
[Screams]

234
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm not a ghost!

235
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Popo!

236
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Prita!

237
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Where are you, Prita?

238
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Where are you?

239
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Prita!

240
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Where are you, Prita?

241
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Alfas!

242
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

243
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I have to go in.

244
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Welcome, Alfa.

245
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And thank you for keeping your promise to come here alone.

246
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Very good.

247
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Antaboga.

248
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Come on!

249
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm scared, Kak.

250
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No one can help you now, Alfa.

251
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Fight Antaboga.

252
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Prita, hurry up and hide in the bushes.

253
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Hurry up!

254
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
[Laughter]

255
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Prita, hurry up!

256
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What is that?

257
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Dad, wake up!

258
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Wake up, Alfa!

259
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Dad, wake up!

260
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm scared, Alfa!

261
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Come on, Prita!

262
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Finally, we're the same, Kak.

263
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes.

264
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Thank you, Popo, for helping us.

265
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Kak Alfa, are you okay?

266
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yes, I'm okay.

267
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Well, I'll go.

268
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Hey, I'm in Ankara!

269
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
[Laughter]

270
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You can't just leave like that.

271
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Because our business is not over yet.

272
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And you are a traitor.

273
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Your turn, after him.

274
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Open fire!

275
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
[Laughter]

276
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And now, feel this.

277
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Don't!

278
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Wake up, Sih!

279
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Dad!

280
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Wake up, Dad!

281
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Professor Gaha!

282
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Dad, wake up!

283
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Alfa, wake up!

284
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Alfa!

285
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Dad!

286
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What's wrong?

287
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Dad!

288
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What's wrong?

289
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Wake up!

290
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Alfa!

291
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It seems Alfa was hit by a shell.

292
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Head down!

293
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Prof, we're not done yet, Megantar.

294
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We still have to close the cave door with a spell.

295
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So that the Antaboga won't appear again forever.

296
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That's right, Prof.

297
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Kurufung!

298
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let me try, Prof.

299
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Kurufung!

300
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Prof, Prof, Prof.

301
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
What if we try together?

302
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Let's do it.

303
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Kurufung!

304
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Dad, wake up!

305
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Why is the door so strong?

306
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You try, Alfa.

307
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Sorry, Prof.

308
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But it seems Alfa's condition is not possible for her.

309
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Alfa, why don't you try?

310
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Come on, concentrate.

311
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You can do it.

312
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Kurufung!

313
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Alfa is so cool!

314
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You're amazing, Alfa.

315
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Maybe my guess is right.

316
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
If Alfa is...

317
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Alfa!

318
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Alfa, wake up!

319
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Wake up!

320
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Alfa!

321
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Dad!

322
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Dad, wake up!

323
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Vega, Rey, Adara.

324
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Welcome, Alfa.

325
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Vega, where's Pelita?

326
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
She's fine.

327
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But, Mr. Galaxy...

328
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
What's wrong with Mr. Galaxy?

329
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Mr. Galaxy saved you and Pelita.

330
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
He was attacked by the Karak.

331
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So, he's being healed by the Eid Mubarak.

332
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Dad!

333
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Dad, wake up!

334
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Be patient, Pelita.

335
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You have to be sincere.

336
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Your dad is calm there.

337
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I only had my dad when I was a kid.

338
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Now, he's gone.

339
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm all alone.

340
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Pelita, you're not alone.

341
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
We're here for you.

342
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I want to go to school with you.

343
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Do you want to?

344
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes.

345
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Come to my room later.

346
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You want to, right?

347
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I miss you so much.

348
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Thank you.

349
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Now, we can go back to school.

350
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Pelita, we'll be together.

351
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So, don't be lonely.

352
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Wait!

353
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I want to go with you.

354
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You can't.

355
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We're going to school.

356
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
If I don't go with you,

357
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll die.

358
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Alfa,

359
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the only way...

360
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
to make me not go with you...

361
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
is by not being your teacher anymore.

362
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But, what should I do?

363
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The way is by giving your hair to the teacher.

364
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Then, he'll be free.

365
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Cut!

366
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Is this for me?

367
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yes.

368
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Are you serious?

369
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Yes.

370
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Now, you're free.

371
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You're not a servant.

372
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm free?

373
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yay!

374
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm free!

375
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,000
[Screaming]

376
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Thank you, Alfa.

377
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You're the best teacher.

378
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You're welcome, Poco.

379
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You're also a savior.

380
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'll go now.

381
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay.

382
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
[Alarm]

383
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Good evening, children.

384
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Good evening, sir.

385
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Now,

386
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'll introduce a new student.

387
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Her name is Pelita.

388
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Pelita?

389
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hi, Pelita.

390
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
My name is Tolik.

391
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Hmm.

392
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Pelita, please sit with me.

393
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Come here, children.

394
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Please sit with me, Pelita.

395
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What do you want to eat?

396
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Children,

397
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
please continue your meal.

398
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Okay, sir.

399
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What?

400
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Wow.

401
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm so hungry.

402
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I haven't eaten for a week.

403
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm confused.

404
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Why do I keep doing this?

405
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I don't feel hungry.

406
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Alfa.

407
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What's wrong?

408
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't know. It's weird.

409
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I don't know.

410
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'll scare her.

411
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't know.

412
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I want to eat this rat.

413
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Hihih.

414
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's delicious.

415
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I know it's delicious.

416
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Do you want to try?

417
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Alfa.

418
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What's wrong?

419
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Alfa.

420
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
What's wrong?

421
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Alfa.

422
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Help.

423
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Alfa.

424
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Help.

425
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Alfa.

426
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Help.

427
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Alfa.

428
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
How do you feel now?

429
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm sick.

430
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm dizzy.

431
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Alfa T got poisoned by a snake.

432
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The snake's poison must be neutralized by the antidote.

433
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
If not, in three days...

434
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Alfa T will become a snake.

435
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Oh, it's big.

436
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's terrifying.

437
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Where's the antidote?

438
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The antidote...

439
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
is in a place that's far away.

440
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Long, long, long, long from here.

441
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's in a mystery island.

442
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
A mystery island that's far away from here.

443
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
The antidote is very rare.

444
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's called the liquid of life.

445
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The antidote is very powerful.

446
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It can cure...

447
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
all diseases.

448
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Oh, diseases.

449
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And Conan said...

450
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the antidote can revive the dead.

451
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So, very amazing.

452
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Very amazing.

453
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Professor.

454
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I will go there to find it.

455
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You can't, Megantara.

456
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Only small children can go there.

457
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Okay, I'll go there.

458
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Me too.

459
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Why do we let small children go there?

460
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That's right, Professor.

461
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm worried too.

462
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
This is a difficult decision for me.

463
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I don't think I can let the children go...

464
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
without our brother.

465
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But we can't let Alfa become a snake.

466
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Professor.

467
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We've often passed dangerous obstacles.

468
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Because we're always compact.

469
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So, we can pass this obstacle.

470
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes, Professor.

471
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I hope we can pass this obstacle.

472
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yes.

473
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay.

474
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I agree.

475
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Thank you, Professor.

476
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:48,000
(Megantara, the best teacher)

477
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Dad, I'm not a bad person, right?

478
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes, but don't be so sure.

479
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We're your friends, right?

480
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yes, we're friends.

481
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Even if it's difficult or we're happy, we're together.

482
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That's right, Ren.

483
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Best.

484
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Ren.

485
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Wow.

486
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm Flipir, I'm a kid.

487
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I was bullied in the market.

488
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You don't know me.

489
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm Megantara.

490
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Tentara.

491
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Why?

492
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I was cute when I was a kid.

493
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
But now I'm handsome, right?

494
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Tentara, you should join us.

495
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yes.

496
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Let's go inside.

497
00:45:48,000 --> 00:46:24,000
(Megantara, the best teacher)

498
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I can do it, right?

499
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yes.

500
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Tentara!

501
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It turns out that I'm not that smart.

502
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
This island is smarter.

503
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Tentara!

504
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Don't!

505
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Don't use magic here.

506
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It's dangerous.

507
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But, Tentara...

508
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
If you use magic,

509
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
the magic will turn against you.

510
00:47:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
(The magic will turn against you)

511
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Alfa, Vega, Ray

512
00:48:43,000 --> 00:49:01,000
(The magic will turn against you)

513
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I told you, this will be useful

514
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Let's get this over with

515
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:31,000
(The magic will turn against you)

516
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Welcome to the Mystery Cave

517
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You will pass the first gate

518
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Which is

519
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The Gate of Dreams

520
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,000
A place where you can eat all kinds of food

521
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But remember

522
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Once you eat that food

523
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You will not be able to continue your journey to the next place

524
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
(The Gate of Dreams)

525
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
If you give up

526
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Like a white flag

527
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Automatically

528
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You will be at the first gate

529
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That's great

530
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Ray, don't be a coward

531
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The important thing is we have to pass all the challenges

532
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The first one who can put the blue flag on the Gate of Dreams

533
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Is the winner

534
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And if there is a disqualified participant

535
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
He will be disqualified

536
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I have to get the Gate of Dreams

537
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So I can live again

538
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Remember

539
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
The liquid of life is very rare

540
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Only one person can get the liquid of life

541
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Do you understand?

542
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Before we start

543
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You can get ready

544
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
The toilet is over there

545
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And the costume room is next to it

546
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:33,000
No one can beat Raya

547
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
She is beautiful

548
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
She will also do the scary thing

549
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Why is someone missing?

550
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We can do it

551
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I have to scare them

552
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So they run away

553
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I have to scare them

554
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So they run away

555
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I have to scare them

556
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So they run away

557
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I have to scare them

558
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So they run away

559
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I have to scare them

560
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So they run away

561
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I have to scare them

562
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So they run away

563
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I have to scare them

564
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So they run away

565
00:52:47,000 --> 00:53:01,000
What is this?

566
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I'm scared, I want to go home

567
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Me too

568
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Who are you?

569
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Where are you from?

570
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We are from the inside

571
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
We give up

572
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Why?

573
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
There are a lot of ghosts

574
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The fish that got the stone

575
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
This is a mystery island

576
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
There are a lot of ghosts

577
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,000
What about Vega, Alba and Reng?

578
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
What if they get the water of life?

579
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Dad, I miss you

580
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Now I don't have anyone

581
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Why did the power reappear?

582
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Mom

583
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Don't leave me

584
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,380
Owha..you guys must have been tired...

585
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,200
I'm sure you don't know what happened to me...

586
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,460
I just feel like I'm being dissipated...

587
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,660
Huh?

588
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:54,280
Why do you seem so whiny?

589
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,760
What's wrong?

590
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,620
I feel like I'm getting older...

591
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,060
I don't want to die anymore...

592
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,540
I only want to continue living...

593
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,720
But I almost died...

594
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,240
You've been living for a long time?

595
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:23,600
[music]

596
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,960
Pelita,

597
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,960
sadness that is too deep and long

598
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,720
will make your strength appear

599
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,640
and if you're angry,

600
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,800
it will endanger you

601
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,080
and others

602
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,280
so you have to be careful

603
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,280
you have to be able to control your emotions

604
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,840
if you're sad,

605
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,640
don't be too sad

606
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,640
and you have to be calm, okay?

607
00:56:48,640 --> 00:57:03,000
[music]

608
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,200
I can't be sad

609
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,560
I'm afraid of being strong

610
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,560
I don't want my strength to appear again

611
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:15,440
[music]

612
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,440
Why is the light not turned off?

613
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:25,960
[music]

614
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,960
Where is the ghost?

615
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,480
[music]

616
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,480
He will also make me scared

617
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,480
[music]

618
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,480
There's something missing

619
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,480
[music]

620
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,480
I'm scared again

621
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,480
[music]

622
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Just give me the real one

623
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
Give it to the jury

624
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:06,480
[music]

625
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Just like that

626
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,480
[music]

627
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,480
If I throw a white flag,

628
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,480
it means I failed

629
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,480
I can't be scared

630
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,480
[music]

631
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Why is he throwing a white flag?

632
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,480
I'm scared again

633
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,480
[music]

634
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,480
I'm not scared

635
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,480
I'm not afraid of you

636
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,480
Come out here

637
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,480
I'm not afraid of you

638
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,480
Come out, Raya

639
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,480
[music]

640
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
Why? Are you afraid of me?

641
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,480
Look at your face

642
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,480
You're really scared of me

643
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,480
You don't know who I am, Raya

644
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,480
I'm not afraid of you

645
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,480
I'm a warrior

646
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,480
A third-world hero

647
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,480
Please, you don't know anything

648
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Oh, really?

649
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,480
Look at your face, you're really scared of me

650
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,480
I'm not afraid of you

[moaning]

653
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
He's so weird

654
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,480
Whatever

655
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,480
I will make him lose

656
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
I have to win

657
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,480
You have to

658
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,480
[music]

659
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,480
I'm coming

00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,480

00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,480

[music]

666
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,480
I have to beat him

667
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,480
And win the title of life

668
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,480
Because that's the only way I can live again

669
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,480
You're so cool, Alfa
