 The monster likes chocolate

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 How can a cruel monster like chocolate?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You have to destroy all the chocolates in the village

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 If necessary, destroy all the chocolate trees there

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 The monster is great

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 The monster is not dead, it just escaped

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So the monster can come back?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It can come back if it smells chocolate

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 The chocolate is in my hand

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And you tell Alva

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 If Alva still wants this child to live

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Then she has to give up

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 The flute played by the dark craftsman

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Makes the monster calm, becomes a beast

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 You teach the flute, okay?

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Okay, I'll teach

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Alva went back to the village

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 What's wrong with Alva?

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Because the news said Professor Ankara kidnapped her

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And Professor Ankara said Alva has to go there

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 No one will accompany her, she has to be alone

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 If not, the news will be spoiled

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I'm in a hurry, I'll go after Alva

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I won't let Ankara take Alva

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I'll go too, Prof

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I have to go save Alva

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 If Ankara gets there

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 If Alva gets a single hair on her head

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I'll tear her body apart

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'll go with you, Prof

58

 What condition?

 is in a place that's far away.

581
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Long, long, long, long from here.

582
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 It's in a mystery island.

583
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 A mystery island that's far away from here.

584
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 The antidote is very rare.

585
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 It's called the liquid of life.

586
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 The antidote is very powerful.

587
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 It can cure...

588
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 all diseases.

589
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Oh, diseases.

590
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 And Conan said...

591
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 the antidote can revive the dead.

592
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 So, very amazing.

593
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 Very amazing.

594
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 Professor.

595
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 I will go there to find it.

596
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 You can't, Megantara.

597
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Only small children can go there.

598
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 Okay, I'll go there.

599
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Me too.

600
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Why do we let small children go there?

601
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 That's right, Professor.

602
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 I'm worried too.

603
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 This is a difficult decision for me.

604
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 I don't think I can let the children go...

605
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 without our brother.

606
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 But we can't let Alva become a snake.

607
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 Professor.

608
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 We've often passed dangerous obstacles.

609
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 Because we're always compact.

610
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 So, we can pass this obstacle.

611
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Yes, Professor.

612
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 I hope we can pass this obstacle.

613
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Yes.

614
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 Okay.

615
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 I agree.

616
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Thank you, Professor.

617
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 (Megantara, the best teacher)

618
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 (Megantara, the best teacher)

619
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Dad, I'm not a bad person, right?

620
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Yes, but don't be so sure.

621
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 We're your friends, right?

622
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Yes, we're friends.

623
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Even if it's difficult or we're happy, we're together.

624
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 That's right, Ren.

625
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Best.

626
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Ren.

627
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Wow.

628
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 I'm Flipir, I'm a kid.

629
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 I was bullied in the market.

630
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 You don't know me.

631
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 I'm Megantara.

632
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Tentara.

633
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Why?

634
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 I was cute when I was a kid.

635
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 But now I'm handsome, right?

636
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 Tentara, you should join us.

637
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 Yes.

638
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 Let's go inside.

639
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Let's go inside.

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 I can do it, right?

658
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Yes.

659
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Tentara!

660
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Tentara!

661
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 It turns out that I'm not that smart.

662
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 This island is smarter.

663
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Tentara!

664
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Tentara!

665
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 Tentara!

666
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Tentara!

667
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 Tentara!

668
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Tentara!

669
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 Don't!

670
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 Don't use magic here.

671
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 It's dangerous.

672
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 But, Tentara...

673
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 If you use magic,

674
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 the magic will turn against you.

675

 I told you, this will be useful

718
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 Let's get this over with

719
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000

 (The magic will turn against you)

731
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Welcome to the Mystery Cave

732
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 You will pass the first gate

733
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 You will pass the first gate

734
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 Which is

735
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 The Gate of Dreams

736
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 A place where you can eat all kinds of food

737
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 A place where you can eat all kinds of food

738
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 But remember

739
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 Once you eat that food

740
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 You will not be able to continue your journey to the next place

741
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 (The Gate of Dreams)

742
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 (The Gate of Dreams)

743
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 (The Gate of Dreams)

744
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 (The Gate of Dreams)

745
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 If you give up

746
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Like a white flag

747
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 Automatically

748
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 You will be at the first gate

749
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 That's great

750
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 Ray, don't be a coward

751
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 Ray, don't be a coward

752
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 The important thing is we have to pass all the challenges

753
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 The important thing is we have to pass all the challenges

754
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 The first one who can put the blue flag on the Gate of Dreams

755
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 The first one who can put the blue flag on the Gate of Dreams

756
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 Is the winner

757
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 And if there is a disqualified participant

758
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 And if there is a disqualified participant

759
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 He will be disqualified

760
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 I have to get the Gate of Dreams

761
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 I have to get the Gate of Dreams

762
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 I have to get the Gate of Dreams

763
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 So I can live again

764
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 Remember

765

 sadness that is too deep and long
