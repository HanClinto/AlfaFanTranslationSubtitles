Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

Go, go, go, fight with your heart

Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The monster likes chocolate

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How can a cruel monster like chocolate?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have to destroy all the chocolates in the village

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If necessary, destroy all the chocolate trees there

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The monster is coming

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The monster is great

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The monster is not dead, it just escaped

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the monster can come back?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It can come back if it smells chocolate

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The chocolate is in my hand

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And you tell Alva

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If Alva still wants this child to live

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then she has to give up

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The flute played by the dark craftsman

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Makes the monster calm, becomes a beast

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You teach the flute, okay?

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, I'll teach

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000

What's wrong, Vega?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alva went back to the village

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's wrong with Alva?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because the news said Professor Ankara kidnapped her

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And Professor Ankara said Alva has to go there

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No one will accompany her, she has to be alone

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If not, the news will be spoiled

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm in a hurry, I'll go after Alva

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't let Ankara take Alva

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll go too, Prof

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I have to go save Alva

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If Ankara gets there

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If Alva gets a single hair on her head

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll tear her body apart

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll go with you, Prof

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000

51

00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Tentara!

577
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Don't!

578
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Don't use magic here.

579
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It's dangerous.

580
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But, Tentara...

581
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
If you use magic,

582
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
the magic will turn against you.

583
00:47:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
(The magic will turn against you)

584
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Alva, Vega, Ray

585
00:48:43,000 --> 00:49:01,000
(The magic will turn against you)

586
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I told you, this will be useful

587
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Let's get this over with

588
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:31,000
(The magic will turn against you)

589
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Welcome to the Mystery Cave

590
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You will pass the first gate

591
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Which is

592
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The Gate of Dreams

593
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,000
A place where you can eat all kinds of food

594
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But remember

595
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Once you eat that food

596
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You will not be able to continue your journey to the next place

597
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
(The Gate of Dreams)

598
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
If you give up

599
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Like a white flag

600
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Automatically

601
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You will be at the first gate

602
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That's great

603
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Ray, don't be a coward

604
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The important thing is we have to pass all the challenges

605
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The first one who can put the blue flag on the Gate of Dreams

606
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Is the winner

607
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And if there is a disqualified participant

608
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
He will be disqualified

609
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I have to get the Gate of Dreams

610
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So I can live again

611
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Remember

612
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
The liquid of life is very rare

613
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Only one person can get the liquid of life

614
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Do you understand?

615
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Before we start

616
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You can get ready

617
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
The toilet is over there

618
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And the costume room is next to it

619
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:33,000
No one can beat Raya

620
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
She is beautiful

621
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
She will also do the scary thing

622
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Why is someone missing?

623
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We can do it

624
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I have to scare them

625
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So they run away

626
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I have to scare them

627
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So they run away

628
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I have to scare them

629
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So they run away

630
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I have to scare them

631
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So they run away

632
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I have to scare them

633
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So they run away

634
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I have to scare them

635
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So they run away

636
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I have to scare them

637
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So they run away

638
00:52:47,000 --> 00:53:01,000
What is this?

639
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I'm scared, I want to go home

640
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Me too

641
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Who are you?

642
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Where are you from?

643
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We are from the inside

644
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
We give up

645
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Why?

646
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
There are a lot of ghosts

647
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The fish that got the stone

648
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
This is a mystery island

649
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
There are a lot of ghosts

650
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,000
What about Vega, Alba and Reng?

651
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
What if they get the water of life?

652
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Dad, I miss you

653
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Now I don't have anyone

654
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Why did the power reappear?

655
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Mom

656
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Don't leave me

657
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,380
Owha..you guys must have been tired...

658
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,200
I'm sure you don't know what happened to me...

659
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,460
I just feel like I'm being dissipated...

660
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,660
Huh?

661
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:54,280
Why do you seem so whiny?

662
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,760
What's wrong?

663
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,620
I feel like I'm getting older...

664
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,060
I don't want to die anymore...

665
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,540
I only want to continue living...

666
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,720
But I almost died...

667
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,240
You've been living for a long time?

668
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:23,600
[music]

669
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,960
Pelita,

670
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,960
sadness that is too deep and long

671
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,720
will make your strength appear

672
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,640
and if you're angry,

673
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,800
it will endanger you

674
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,080
and others

675
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,280
so you have to be careful

676
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,280
you have to be able to control your emotions

677
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,840
if you're sad,

678
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,640
don't be too sad

679
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,640
and you have to be calm, okay?

680
00:56:48,640 --> 00:57:03,000
[music]

681
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,200
I can't be sad

682
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,560
I'm afraid of being strong

683
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,560
I don't want my strength to appear again

684
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:15,440
[music]

685
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,440
Why is the light not turned off?

[music]

687
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,960
Where is the ghost?

[music]

689
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,480
He will also make me scared

691
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,480

693
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,480

[music]

695
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Just give me the real one

696
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
Give it to the jury

[music]

698
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,480

[music]

700
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,480
If I throw a white flag,

701
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,480
it means I failed

702
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,480
I can't be scared

[music]

704
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Why is he throwing a white flag?

705
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,480
I'm scared again

00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,480
[music]

707
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,480
I'm not scared

708
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,480
I'm not afraid of you

709
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,480
Come out here

00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,480
I'm not afraid of you

713
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
Why? Are you afraid of me?

714
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,480
Look at your face

715
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,480
You're really scared of me

716
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,480
You don't know who I am, Raya

717
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,480
I'm not afraid of you

718
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,480
I'm a warrior

719
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,480
A third-world hero

720
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,480
Please, you don't know anything

00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Oh, really?

00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,480
Look at your face, you're really scared of me

Whatever

728
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,480
I will make him lose

729
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
I have to win

730
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,480

And win the title of life
