 To be continued...

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 To be continued...

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 To be continued...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Show your spirit, get your friends ready

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Be brave, don't give up

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Chase your hopes and dreams

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 We don't have much time

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We have to destroy the crystal ball

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Because if the crystal ball is full, it means the children's energy has been taken

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And the children can die

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Mutyara!

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 This is all because of the curse of the 8th prince

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Mutyara has leaked where the children are now

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Starting tomorrow, you will have a mid-semester vacation

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And you will do a field trip to the magic village not far from the school

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I just got news that the children from the magic school will be conducting a tour to the magic village

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And I think we can attack Alva there

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 This time I don't want to fail again

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It turns out that the prophecy is true

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 The plan has come

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 We will all be affected by the curse of the legendary monster

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 He's right

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 The curse of the legendary monster

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 What did those people mean?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 What is the legendary monster?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Go back, go back

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Be quiet

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 As students of the magic school

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 You all can't be afraid

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 What if we become a stone?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Calm down, kids

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 We will definitely find out what has happened

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Megantara, it's better if you take the children out of here now

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And don't let a single child fly

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Okay

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Defend

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Defend

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Move

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Move

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Kids

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Let's go to the magic village

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 We must always be together

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And don't let anything go

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Do you understand?

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Yes, sir

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Let's go

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Alva, the legendary monster

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We must tell Professor Aldebaran about this

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Yes, sir

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Good afternoon, Professor Aldebaran

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Something terrible has happened here

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 When Nick wanted to report to the galaxy village

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Suddenly, he turned into a stone

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Nick turned into a stone?

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Who did that?

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 We don't know, Professor

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It all happened so suddenly

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 But now all the children have been taken to a safe place

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Okay, you all keep an eye on the students

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And take care of them

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I will go there with the chief to take care of Nick

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yes, sir

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Stop

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Stop

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Why did you stop?

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 What's the problem?

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Is it painful?

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 We can't enter this village

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 What?

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Is there something that can stop us?

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Oh no

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Luckily I didn't go there

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 If I didn't, I would have been burnt

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 What really happened to this village?

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 [The story of the children who experienced this]

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Mr. Lura

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 For a child who experienced this

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 What should we do?

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 In this village

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 There is a lake that can cure all kinds of diseases

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Who knows

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 It can cure this curse

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Okay

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Thank you, Mr. Lura

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I will go to the lake right away

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Please

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Keep an eye on the children

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Okay

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Be careful, Tara

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Be careful

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 There is a lightning

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Coming from the sky

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Don't worry

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Megantara

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Will come back

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 [The story of the children who experienced this]

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Stop, Megantara

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Megantara

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Don't go through this gate

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Professor Aldebaran

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Concentrate, Megantara

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Look slowly

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Professor

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Who installed the horrible magic in this gate?

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 I don't know, Megantara

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Obviously

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 You can't leave this village

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And we can't enter the village

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 But, Professor Aldebaran

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I have to look for a lake outside this village

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Because the water of the lake

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Can restore Nick as he lost

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 There is another way, Megantara

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 In this village forest

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 There is still a mushroom that can cure the curse

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Look for that mushroom now

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 If in three hours

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 The child can't find the mushroom

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Then he will be a stone forever

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Doctor Kutip

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 There are millions of mushroom in the forest

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Which mushroom can cure Nick's curse?

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That mushroom

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Different from the others

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 The head is down

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 The position is tilting back

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Fast

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Okay

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 I will look for that mushroom

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 By using the mantra

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Dafatang

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Wait, wait, wait

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Wait, wait, wait

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 You can't do that

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Don't use magic

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 The power of the mushroom will be reduced

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 It's better to use

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Your hand

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Remember

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Don't use magic

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 You know?

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And one more thing, Megantara

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 You have to stay calm

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Don't show your competition to the children

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 If they are afraid

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 They will run to this gate

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And it's dangerous for them

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Yes, professor

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Soldier

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Where is the soldier?

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Where is the soldier?

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Where is the soldier?

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Where is the soldier?

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Yes

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 That's a medicine for Nick

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I just

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Met professor Aldebaran

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Professor Aldebaran

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Apologize

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 He can't

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Gather with you

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Because he has something to do

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 What should I do?

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I want to go home

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Yes, bro

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 How can we go home?

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 We want to go home, too

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Children

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Professor Aldebaran

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Messages you

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So you can help me

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 To find

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 The forest mushroom

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Mushroom?

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Yes, the forest mushroom

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Because according to professor

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 This forest mushroom can cure Nick

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But this is not just a mushroom

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 This mushroom grows in a different way

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 The umbrella is below

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 The mushroom stalk is above

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Notice

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 This is the most important

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 This mushroom can't be taken

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 By using a manual

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Professor Aldebaran also

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Messages you all

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 When in the forest

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Please

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 You have to focus

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Don't play around

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Don't look left and right

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And hold something unimportant

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Do you understand?

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Yes, sir

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Okay

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Now you can get ready

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Want to talk to

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Professor Purwa first

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 In the classroom

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Megantara

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Is there a problem?

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 No

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 The village gate

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Is given a very strong mantra

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 That's

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 What makes people here

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Can't get out

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And can't get in

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Because of that

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Professor Aldebaran

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Can't come here

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Professor Aldebaran orders

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So that we can protect

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And protect the children

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Don't let

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 A child dare

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 To break the gate

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Because this will be very dangerous for them

232
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Wait

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 I will

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Help you

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 To find the forest mushroom

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Children

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Before we enter the magic forest

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 To find the forest mushroom

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I will

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Divide you into groups

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 One group

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Five people

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Davatang

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000

 Pluid

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Now

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 You are divided into groups

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 One by one

250
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 If one of you

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Has found the mushroom

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 You just have to make the noise

253
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Do you understand?

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Yes, sir

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And if there is a danger

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 That approaches you

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 You just have to make the noise

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000

 Professor

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Why is Tintara alone?

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Because she is Megantara, Alva

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 She is a very strong and tough person

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 But you

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 You can't be alone

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 You still need an assistant

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Come on

 Focus on finding the mushroom that grows upside down

 Do you understand?

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I understand, professor

280
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Don't touch anything in this forest

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Okay, sir

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Hurry up

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Sorry, boss

804
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 We're trapped here

805
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Don't be so harsh, Professor Purwa

806
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 We have to cover this up

807
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Don't make them panic

808
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Yes

809
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Poor them

810
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 We brought them here to do field trip

811
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 To have fun

812
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 But in fact

813
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 We're trapped here

814
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 I have an idea

815
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 There's a crow

816
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 It's been brought here

817
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 It's been stabbed in the back

818
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Don't worry, professors

819
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Tomorrow

820
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 We'll ask them to do something fun

825
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 What's wrong?

826
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Why are you so nervous?

827
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 I'm scared, Vega

828
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 Why?

829
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 What happened today

830
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 It's like what the legend said

831
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Legend?

832
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 What legend?

847
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 We told you to come here

848
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 But why did you refuse?

849
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 This place is dangerous for you

850
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 Who are you?

851
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 Why do you always appear in my dream?

852
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 I'm Gamar

853
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 I'm Queen

00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 We're two

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 You're so beautiful

856
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 Now you have to remember, Alpha

857
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 Don't look at me like that

858
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Remember, don't ever look at me like that

859
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 What do you mean?

00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000

864
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 Why did you wake up?

865
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Why did you dream?

866
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 I couldn't sleep

867
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 Why?

868
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 I don't know

869
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 But I think I feel something

870
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 I think the teachers are hiding something from us

871
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 Hiding something?

872
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 Two kids have been killed

873
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 But we can't go home yet

874
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 And the professor

875
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 He said he would come

876
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000

878
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 If this legend is true

879
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 It means the monster is gone

880
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 And later we have to find out who the real Bima is

 I have a clue about this

885
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 Come here

886
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 Here's the book

887
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 100 years ago

888
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 The people of Sihir village lived in peace

889
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Until one day

890
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 A disaster came to the village

892
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 The disaster was like a curse

893
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 The village was in chaos

894
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 And many people turned into stone

895
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 Help me

897
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 It's so scary

898
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 The only hope of the village was

899
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 A great sorcerer named Bima Sakti

900
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 [music]

901
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 The villagers were still afraid

902
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 They couldn't trust anyone

903
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 Even a good sorcerer like you

905
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 What's wrong?

906
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 Help me

907
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Save this village, Bima Sakti

909
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 Look

910
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 This village is like dead

911
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 No one dares to leave the house

912
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 Because they're afraid of being cursed

913
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 [monster cry]

914
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 Why are you pale?

915
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 My family is cursed by the monster

916
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Finally, Bima Sakti faced the monster

918
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000

 [music]

920
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 Bima Sakti defeated the monster

921
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 And locked it in the cave

922
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 No one knows where the monster is

923
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 But the spell doesn't last forever

924
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 So the monster can be released

926
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Only the fifth generation can open it

927
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 If this legend is true

928
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 The monster is released

929
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 We have to find out who Bima Sakti is

930
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 Who can lock the monster in the cave

931
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 Who is he?

933
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 All the disciples and teachers in the village are in the cave

934
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 How can I get in there and help them?

 Children, even though we're on vacation

937
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 We still have to learn magic

 Now I'm going to teach you a magic

941
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 This magic can neutralize the enemy's attack

942
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 Which makes you powerless

943
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 Makes you stiff

944
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 And you can't do anything

945
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 But if you use this magic

946
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 You will be free

947
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 And will be normal

948
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 Yes, great

949
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 I have to be able to do this

950
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 Teach me

951
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Okay, get ready

952
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 We will make you stiff and powerless

 Now I will teach you a magic

958
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 Which will free you from this helplessness

959
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 The magic is

960
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Free from murder

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 Who can be free first

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 You can take the chocolate on the table

 And if you can't free yourself

968
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 You will be punished

00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 But he didn't mean to

982
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 He was really scared

983
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 He mispronounced the mantra and he got you

984
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000

 Wait, come here

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 I'm surprised

993
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 How can a snake talk to you?

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 I'm also surprised

995
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 But I used to talk to a snake

996
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 Huh?

997
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 When?

998
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 When I lived with my uncle and aunt

999
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 [music]

1000
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 Is it weird that I can talk to a snake?

1001
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 Wait, wait

1002
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 You can talk to a snake in the kitchen

1003
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 Then what animal can you talk to?

1004
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 [music]

1005
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 You're lying

1006
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 The teeth can kill

1007
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 But you can kill it through the teeth

1008
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 You're so smart

1009
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 Maybe I'm a descendant of the devil

1010
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 [music]

1011
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 How can we get rid of this?

1012
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 And we can't go home

1013
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 Because the village gate is haunted by a very powerful magic

1014
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 We're all trapped here

1015
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 Now we know that the monster likes chocolate

1016
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 So we have to trick our friends to drink chocolate

1017
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 I agree

1018
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 So that the monster won't be harmed

1019
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 Let's go

1020
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 [music]

1021
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 Opo, my dear

1022
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Do you want to help me do my job?

1023
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 [music]

1024
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to chase your friends

1025
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 Run, jump, jump, chase the stars

1026
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 Dare, don't know, say, give up

1027
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Chase your hopes and dreams

1028
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

1029
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

1030
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

1031
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

1032
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

1033
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 Go! Go! Go!

1034
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 Let's do it together!
