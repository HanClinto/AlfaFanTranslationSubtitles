1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Show your spirit, get your friends ready

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Chase your hopes and dreams

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We don't have much time

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We have to destroy the crystal ball

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because if the crystal ball is full, it means the children's energy has been taken

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And the children can die

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mutyara!

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is all because of the curse of the 8th prince

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mutyara has leaked where the children are now

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Starting tomorrow, you will have a mid-semester vacation

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And you will do a field trip to the magic village not far from the school

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I just got news that the children from the magic school will be conducting a tour to the magic village

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And I think we can attack Alfa there

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This time I don't want to fail again

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It turns out that the prophecy is true

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The plan has come

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We will all be affected by the curse of the legendary monster

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's right

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The curse of the legendary monster

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What did those people mean?

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is the legendary monster?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go back, go back

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Be quiet

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
As students of the magic school

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You all can't be afraid

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What if we become a stone?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Calm down, kids

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We will definitely find out what has happened

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Megantara, it's better if you take the children out of here now

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And don't let a single child fly

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Defend

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Move

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Kids

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go to the magic village

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We must always be together

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And don't let anything go

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you understand?

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, sir

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Alfa, the legendary monster

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We must tell Professor Aldebaran about this

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, sir

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Good afternoon, Professor Aldebaran

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Something terrible has happened here

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When Nick wanted to report to the galaxy village

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Suddenly, he turned into a stone

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Nick turned into a stone?

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who did that?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We don't know, Professor

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It all happened so suddenly

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But now all the children have been taken to a safe place

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, you all keep an eye on the students

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And take care of them

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I will go there with the chief to take care of Nick

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes, sir

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Stop

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why did you stop?

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's the problem?

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is it painful?

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We can't enter this village

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What?

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is there something that can stop us?

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh no

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Luckily I didn't go there

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If I didn't, I would have been burnt

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What really happened to this village?

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
[The story of the children who experienced this]

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Lura

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For a child who experienced this

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What should we do?

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In this village

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There is a lake that can cure all kinds of diseases

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who knows

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It can cure this curse

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you, Mr. Lura

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will go to the lake right away

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Keep an eye on the children

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Be careful, Tara

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Be careful

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There is a lightning

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Coming from the sky

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't worry

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Megantara

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Will come back

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
[The story of the children who experienced this]

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stop, Megantara

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Megantara

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't go through this gate

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Professor Aldebaran

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Concentrate, Megantara

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Look slowly

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Professor

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Who installed the horrible magic in this gate?

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know, Megantara

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Obviously

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can't leave this village

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And we can't enter the village

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But, Professor Aldebaran

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to look for a lake outside this village

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because the water of the lake

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can restore Nick as he lost

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There is another way, Megantara

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In this village forest

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There is still a mushroom that can cure the curse

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Look for that mushroom now

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If in three hours

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The child can't find the mushroom

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Then he will be a stone forever

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Doctor Kutip

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There are millions of mushroom in the forest

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Which mushroom can cure Nick's curse?

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That mushroom

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Different from the others

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The head is down

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The position is tilting back

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Fast

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will look for that mushroom

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
By using the mantra

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Dafatang

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wait, wait, wait

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can't do that

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't use magic

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The power of the mushroom will be reduced

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's better to use

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Your hand

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Remember

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't use magic

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know?

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And one more thing, Megantara

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You have to stay calm

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't show your competition to the children

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If they are afraid

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They will run to this gate

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And it's dangerous for them

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, professor

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Soldier

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Where is the soldier?

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's a medicine for Nick

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I just

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Met professor Aldebaran

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Professor Aldebaran

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Apologize

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He can't

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Gather with you

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because he has something to do

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What should I do?

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I want to go home

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, bro

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How can we go home?

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We want to go home, too

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Children

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Professor Aldebaran

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Messages you

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So you can help me

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
To find

172
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The forest mushroom

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mushroom?

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, the forest mushroom

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because according to professor

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This forest mushroom can cure Nick

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But this is not just a mushroom

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This mushroom grows in a different way

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The umbrella is below

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The mushroom stalk is above

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Notice

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is the most important

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This mushroom can't be taken

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
By using a manual

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Professor Aldebaran also

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Messages you all

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When in the forest

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You have to focus

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't play around

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't look left and right

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And hold something unimportant

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Do you understand?

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes, sir

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now you can get ready

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Want to talk to

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Professor Purwa first

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
In the classroom

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Megantara

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is there a problem?

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The village gate

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Is given a very strong mantra

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's

208
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What makes people here

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Can't get out

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And can't get in

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because of that

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Professor Aldebaran

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Can't come here

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Professor Aldebaran orders

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So that we can protect

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And protect the children

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't let

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
A child dare

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
To break the gate

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Because this will be very dangerous for them

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wait

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I will

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Help you

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
To find the forest mushroom

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Children

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Before we enter the magic forest

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
To find the forest mushroom

228
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I will

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Divide you into groups

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
One group

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Five people

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Davatang

Pluid

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Now

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You are divided into groups

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
One by one

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If one of you

240
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Has found the mushroom

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You just have to make the noise

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Do you understand?

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes, sir

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And if there is a danger

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That approaches you

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You just have to make the noise

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000

Professor

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why is Tintara alone?

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because she is Megantara, Alfa

256
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She is a very strong and tough person

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But you

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You can't be alone

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You still need an assistant

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on

Focus on finding the mushroom that grows upside down

Do you understand?

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I understand, professor

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't touch anything in this forest

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay, sir

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hurry up

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000

You're so kind, professor

You'd better whistle

But I have to go to the village

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I have to find many people there

605
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Just say it

606
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000

Let's go there

610
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Eh

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just say it

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
If you don't go there

615
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You will be eaten

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's scary

Who is this, Alfa?

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They will recover in 48 hours

Don't be afraid

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
If this legend is true

797
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It means the monster is gone

798
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And later we have to find out who the real Bima is

799
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:15,000
[music]

800
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
What are you doing here?

801
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I have a clue about this

802
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Come here

803
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Here's the book

804
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
100 years ago

805
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
The people of Sihir village lived in peace

806
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Until one day

807
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
A disaster came to the village

808
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:52,000
[music]

809
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The disaster was like a curse

810
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The village was in chaos

811
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And many people turned into stone

812
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Help me

813
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
[music]

814
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's so scary

815
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The only hope of the village was

816
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
A great sorcerer named Bima Sakti

817
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:30,000
[music]

818
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The villagers were still afraid

819
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
They couldn't trust anyone

820
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Even a good sorcerer like you

821
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
[music]

822
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
What's wrong?

823
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Help me

824
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Save this village, Bima Sakti

825
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
[music]

826
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Look

827
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
This village is like dead

828
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
No one dares to leave the house

829
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Because they're afraid of being cursed

830
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
[monster cry]

831
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Why are you pale?

832
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
My family is cursed by the monster

833
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Finally, Bima Sakti faced the monster

834
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:42,000
[music]

835
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm going to kill you

836
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
[music]

837
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Bima Sakti defeated the monster

838
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And locked it in the cave

839
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
No one knows where the monster is

840
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But the spell doesn't last forever

841
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So the monster can be released

842
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
[music]

843
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Only the fifth generation can open it

844
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
If this legend is true

845
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
The monster is released

846
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
We have to find out who Bima Sakti is

847
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Who can lock the monster in the cave

848
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Who is he?

849
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:48,000
[music]

850
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
All the disciples and teachers in the village are in the cave

851
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
How can I get in there and help them?

852
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
[music]

853
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Children, even though we're on vacation

854
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
We still have to learn magic

855
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
[music]

856
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Children

857
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Now I'm going to teach you a magic

858
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
This magic can neutralize the enemy's attack

859
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Which makes you powerless

860
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Makes you stiff

861
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And you can't do anything

862
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
But if you use this magic

863
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You will be free

864
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And will be normal

865
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes, great

866
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I have to be able to do this

867
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Teach me

868
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Okay, get ready

869
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We will make you stiff and powerless

870
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000

[music]

873
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Concentrate

874
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Now I will teach you a magic

875
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Which will free you from this helplessness

876
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The magic is

877
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Free from murder

878
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,000
[music]

879
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Come on, children

880
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Concentrate

881
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Who can be free first

882
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You can take the chocolate on the table

883
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
[music]

884
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And if you can't free yourself

885
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You will be punished

886
00:53:15,000 --> 00:55:00,000

887
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000

[music]

889
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Be free, be free

890
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Don't

891
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
[music]

892
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Don't disturb us

893
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Who disturb me?

894
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But he didn't mean to

895
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
He was really scared

896
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
He mispronounced the mantra and he got you

897
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Forgive him

898
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:28,000
[music]

899
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Be free, be free

900
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,000
[music]

901
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Children, I will help you

902
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:54,000
[music]

903
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What's wrong?

904
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Wait, come here

905
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm surprised

906
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
How can a snake talk to you?

907
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I'm also surprised

908
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But I used to talk to a snake

909
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Huh?

910
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
When?

911
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
When I lived with my uncle and aunt

912
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
[music]

913
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Is it weird that I can talk to a snake?

914
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Wait, wait

915
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You can talk to a snake in the kitchen

916
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Then what animal can you talk to?

917
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
[music]

918
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You're lying

919
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
The teeth can kill

920
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But you can kill it through the teeth

921
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You're so smart

922
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Maybe I'm a descendant of the devil

923
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:56,000
[music]

924
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
How can we get rid of this?

925
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And we can't go home

926
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Because the village gate is haunted by a very powerful magic

927
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We're all trapped here

928
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Now we know that the monster likes chocolate

929
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So we have to trick our friends to drink chocolate

930
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I agree

931
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So that the monster won't be harmed

932
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Let's go

933
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
[music]

934
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Opo, my dear

935
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Do you want to help me do my job?

936
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
[music]

937
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Show your spirit, get ready to chase your friends

938
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Run, jump, jump, chase the stars

939
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Dare, don't know, say, give up

940
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Chase your hopes and dreams

941
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

942
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Go, go, go, never stop

943
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

944
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

945
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

946
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Go! Go! Go!

947
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Let's do it together!
