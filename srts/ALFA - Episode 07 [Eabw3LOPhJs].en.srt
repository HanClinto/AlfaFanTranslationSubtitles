14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We don't have much time

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We have to destroy the crystal ball

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because if the crystal ball is full, it means the children's energy has been taken

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And the children can die

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mutyara!

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is all because of the curse of the 8th prince

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mutyara has leaked where the children are now

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Starting tomorrow, you will have a mid-semester vacation

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And you will do a field trip to the magic village not far from the school

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I just got news that the children from the magic school will be conducting a tour to the magic village

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And I think we can attack Alfa there

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This time I don't want to fail again

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It turns out that the prophecy is true

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The plan has come

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We will all be affected by the curse of the legendary monster

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's right

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The curse of the legendary monster

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What did those people mean?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is the legendary monster?

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go back, go back

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Be quiet

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
As students of the magic school

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You all can't be afraid

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What if we become a stone?

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Calm down, kids

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We will definitely find out what has happened

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Megantara, it's better if you take the children out of here now

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And don't let a single child fly

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Defend

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Move

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Kids

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go to the magic village

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We must always be together

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And don't let anything go

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you understand?

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, sir

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Alfa, the legendary monster

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We must tell Professor Aldebaran about this

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, sir

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Good afternoon, Professor Aldebaran

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Something terrible has happened here

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When Nick wanted to report to the galaxy village

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Suddenly, he turned into a stone

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Nick turned into a stone?

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who did that?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We don't know, Professor

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It all happened so suddenly

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But now all the children have been taken to a safe place

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, you all keep an eye on the students

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And take care of them

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I will go there with the chief to take care of Nick

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes, sir

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Stop

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why did you stop?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's the problem?

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is it painful?

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We can't enter this village

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What?

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is there something that can stop us?

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh no

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Luckily I didn't go there

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If I didn't, I would have been burnt

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What really happened to this village?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
[The story of the children who experienced this]

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Lura

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For a child who experienced this

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What should we do?

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In this village

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There is a lake that can cure all kinds of diseases

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who knows

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It can cure this curse

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you, Mr. Lura

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will go to the lake right away

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Keep an eye on the children

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Be careful, Tara

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Be careful

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There is a lightning

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Coming from the sky

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't worry

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Megantara

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Will come back

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
[The story of the children who experienced this]

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stop, Megantara

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Megantara

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't go through this gate

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Professor Aldebaran

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Concentrate, Megantara

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Look slowly

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Professor

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Who installed the horrible magic in this gate?

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know, Megantara

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Obviously

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can't leave this village

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And we can't enter the village

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But, Professor Aldebaran

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to look for a lake outside this village

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because the water of the lake

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can restore Nick as he lost

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There is another way, Megantara

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In this village forest

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There is still a mushroom that can cure the curse

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Look for that mushroom now

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If in three hours

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The child can't find the mushroom

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Then he will be a stone forever

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Doctor Kutip

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There are millions of mushroom in the forest

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Which mushroom can cure Nick's curse?

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That mushroom

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Different from the others

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The head is down

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The position is tilting back

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Fast

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will look for that mushroom

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
By using the mantra

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Dafatang

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wait, wait, wait

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can't do that

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't use magic

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The power of the mushroom will be reduced

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's better to use

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Your hand

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Remember

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't use magic

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know?

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And one more thing, Megantara

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You have to stay calm

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't show your competition to the children

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If they are afraid

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They will run to this gate

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And it's dangerous for them

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, professor

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Soldier

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Where is the soldier?

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's a medicine for Nick

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I just

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Met professor Aldebaran

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Professor Aldebaran

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Apologize

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He can't

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Gather with you

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because he has something to do

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What should I do?

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I want to go home

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, bro

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How can we go home?

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We want to go home, too

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Children

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Professor Aldebaran

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Messages you

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So you can help me

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
To find

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The forest mushroom

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mushroom?

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, the forest mushroom

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because according to professor

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This forest mushroom can cure Nick

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But this is not just a mushroom

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This mushroom grows in a different way

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The umbrella is below

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The mushroom stalk is above

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Notice

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is the most important

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This mushroom can't be taken

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
By using a manual

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Professor Aldebaran also

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Messages you all

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When in the forest

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You have to focus

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't play around

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't look left and right

195
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And hold something unimportant

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Do you understand?

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes, sir

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now you can get ready

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Want to talk to

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Professor Purwa first

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
In the classroom

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Megantara

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is there a problem?

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The village gate

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Is given a very strong mantra

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What makes people here

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Can't get out

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And can't get in

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because of that

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Professor Aldebaran

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Can't come here

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Professor Aldebaran orders

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So that we can protect

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And protect the children

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't let

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
A child dare

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
To break the gate

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Because this will be very dangerous for them

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wait

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I will

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Help you

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
To find the forest mushroom

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Children

228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Before we enter the magic forest

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
To find the forest mushroom

230
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I will

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Divide you into groups

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
One group

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Five people

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000

Pluid

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Now

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You are divided into groups

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
One by one

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If one of you

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Has found the mushroom

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You just have to make the noise

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Do you understand?

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes, sir

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And if there is a danger

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That approaches you

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You just have to make the noise

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000

Professor

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why is Tintara alone?

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because she is Megantara, Alfa

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She is a very strong and tough person

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But you

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You can't be alone

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You still need an assistant

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on

Focus on finding the mushroom that grows upside down

Do you understand?

270
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I understand, professor

271
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't touch anything in this forest

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay, sir

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hurry up

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000

You're so kind, professor

You'd better whistle

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
If not

597
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Popo will die

I still see Popo as a spy

600
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So, you have to save Popo now

601
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So

602
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yes

603
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Popo will be your servant

605
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But I have to go to the village

606
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I have to find many people there

607
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Just say it

608
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm your servant

610
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You're right

611
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Let's go there

612
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Eh

613
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Go

614
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yes

615
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just say it

616
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
If you don't go there

617
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You will be eaten

618
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's scary

619
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
If I don't go there

620
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What will I wear?

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Who is this, Alfa?

624
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Eh

625
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Why are you asking?

626
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000

After they're buried

630
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They will recover in 48 hours

631
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I hope

632
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000

How is Netoloso and Kanik?

Don't worry, Vega

Mosquitoes are very venomous

Don't be afraid

Alfa is your friend

Alfa, where have you been?

I'm worried about you

I thought you were a rock

You've been lying to me

It's not easy to be a rock

I'm not a rock

You can't do that

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But we can't go home yet

794
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And the professor

795
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
He said he would come

796
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But he hasn't come yet

797
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
[music]

798
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
If this legend is true

799
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It means the monster is gone

800
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And later we have to find out who the real Bima is

801
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:15,000
[music]

802
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
What are you doing here?

803
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I have a clue about this

804
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Come here

805
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Here's the book

806
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
100 years ago

807
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
The people of Sihir village lived in peace

808
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Until one day

809
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
A disaster came to the village

810
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:52,000
[music]

811
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The disaster was like a curse

812
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The village was in chaos

813
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And many people turned into stone

814
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Help me

815
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
[music]

816
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's so scary

817
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The only hope of the village was

818
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
A great sorcerer named Bima Sakti

819
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:30,000
[music]

820
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The villagers were still afraid

821
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
They couldn't trust anyone

822
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Even a good sorcerer like you

823
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
[music]

824
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
What's wrong?

825
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Help me

826
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Save this village, Bima Sakti

827
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
[music]

828
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Look

829
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
This village is like dead

830
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
No one dares to leave the house

831
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Because they're afraid of being cursed

832
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
[monster cry]

833
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Why are you pale?

834
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
My family is cursed by the monster

835
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Finally, Bima Sakti faced the monster

836
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:42,000
[music]

837
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm going to kill you

838
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
[music]

839
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Bima Sakti defeated the monster

840
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And locked it in the cave

841
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
No one knows where the monster is

842
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But the spell doesn't last forever

843
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So the monster can be released

844
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
[music]

845
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Only the fifth generation can open it

846
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
If this legend is true

847
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
The monster is released

848
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
We have to find out who Bima Sakti is

849
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Who can lock the monster in the cave

850
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Who is he?

851
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:48,000
[music]

852
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
All the disciples and teachers in the village are in the cave

853
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
How can I get in there and help them?

854
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
[music]

855
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Children, even though we're on vacation

856
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
We still have to learn magic

857
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
[music]

858
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Children

859
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Now I'm going to teach you a magic

860
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
This magic can neutralize the enemy's attack

861
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Which makes you powerless

862
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Makes you stiff

863
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And you can't do anything

864
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
But if you use this magic

865
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You will be free

866
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And will be normal

867
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes, great

868
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I have to be able to do this

869
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Teach me

870
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Okay, get ready

871
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We will make you stiff and powerless

872
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
[music]

873
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Kavaku Wada

874
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:26,000
[music]

875
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Concentrate

876
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Now I will teach you a magic

877
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Which will free you from this helplessness

878
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The magic is

879
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Free from murder

880
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,000
[music]

881
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Come on, children

882
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Concentrate

883
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Who can be free first

884
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You can take the chocolate on the table

885
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
[music]

886
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And if you can't free yourself

887
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You will be punished

888
00:53:15,000 --> 00:55:00,000
[music]

889
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000

00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:39,000
[music]

891
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Be free, be free

892
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Don't

893
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
[music]

894
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Don't disturb us

895
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Who disturb me?

896
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But he didn't mean to

897
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
He was really scared

898
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
He mispronounced the mantra and he got you

899
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Forgive him

900
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:28,000
[music]

901
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Be free, be free

902
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,000
[music]

903
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Children, I will help you

904
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:54,000
[music]

905
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What's wrong?

906
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Wait, come here

907
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm surprised

908
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
How can a snake talk to you?

909
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I'm also surprised

910
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But I used to talk to a snake

911
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Huh?

912
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
When?

913
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
When I lived with my uncle and aunt

914
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
[music]

915
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Is it weird that I can talk to a snake?

916
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Wait, wait

917
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You can talk to a snake in the kitchen

918
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Then what animal can you talk to?

919
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
[music]

920
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You're lying

921
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
The teeth can kill

922
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But you can kill it through the teeth

923
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You're so smart

924
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Maybe I'm a descendant of the devil

925
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:56,000
[music]

926
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
How can we get rid of this?

927
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And we can't go home

928
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Because the village gate is haunted by a very powerful magic

929
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We're all trapped here

930
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Now we know that the monster likes chocolate

931
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So we have to trick our friends to drink chocolate

932
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I agree

933
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So that the monster won't be harmed

934
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Let's go

935
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
[music]

936
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Opo, my dear

937
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Do you want to help me do my job?

938
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
[music]

939
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Show your spirit, get ready to chase your friends

940
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Run, jump, jump, chase the stars

941
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Dare, don't know, say, give up

942
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Chase your hopes and dreams

943
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

944
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Go, go, go, never stop

945
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

946
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

947
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

948
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Go! Go! Go!

949
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Let's do it together!
