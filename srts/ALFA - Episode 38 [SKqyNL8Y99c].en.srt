This is our heritage

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why is it used by you?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, it's impossible

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It must be similar

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Aldebaran, our kingdom's heirloom

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And according to the power of the gods, the heirloom is in one of the buildings of this school

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How is it possible that the heirloom is here?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The heirloom is in a woman with long hair, fair skin

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the woman is here

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What she meant was me

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But how is it possible that I'm wearing a heirloom?

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I haven't seen them for a long time

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What is this?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm confused

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What does this mean?

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't you know?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Me neither

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you done?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, professor

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's it? You're not strong enough?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're a coward

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then, let's go down

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's go down

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come on

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You almost stepped on me

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How is it?

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The heirloom can't be seen by the woman

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then, how?

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just think about it, Rick

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're a coward

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, Alfa and her friends didn't go to class

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Where are they?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know, professor

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tommy said they were not here last night

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, I came to the professor

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think the professor knows where they are

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Usually, I know

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But this time, they didn't say anything about me

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I haven't heard about them

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
[The professor is looking for the heirloom]

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry, professor

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did you see professor Purwa?

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Purwa?

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, professor Purwa is not here

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've been looking for him

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I haven't found him yet

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Where are they?

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
[The professor is looking for the heirloom]

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We can escape if we have the heirloom

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If not, we'll be kidnapped by the witch

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm still confused about what the heirloom means

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alfa, do you understand?

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't understand

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't understand either

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's wrong with him?

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Kids

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What's wrong with him?

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mr. Panji, why are you here?

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We've been following you

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So, have you found the heirloom?

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Not yet

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The witch said that the heirloom is a woman's hand

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, we're confused

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Maybe the witch is a witch

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, let's go back to school

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll punish you because you're lazy

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you understand?

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We're lazy?

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, the professor is also lazy

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The professor is here, right?

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Right?

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Professor is lazy

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Shut up!

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You guys

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now, take out your lollipop

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Come on

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But, professor

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No buts

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Come on

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The Witch's Hand

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Everyone, on the count of three

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
One, two, three

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Fly!

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alfa

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What's wrong?

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why don't you fly?

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nothing

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nothing?

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Panji

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Alfa

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, ma'am

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's wrong?

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you still remember what the witch said?

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Of course

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What's wrong?

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Nothing, ma'am

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I just feel like

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
She meant you

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Maybe the lollipop you're wearing

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is the witch's hand

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Impossible, ma'am

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The witch's hand can't be mine

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Enough, ma'am

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't want to think about it anymore

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Go!

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't tell you

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If the witch's hand is really the witch's hand

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I want to find the evidence

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Professor is inside

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Sorry, we're not allowed to go to school

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Without permission from the professor

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You don't have to apologize

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm glad you can take the kids home safely

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You two, please come in

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to talk to the kids

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, professor

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Where did you go last night?

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We're looking for information about the lollipop

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Professor, the witch said

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The lollipop is in the hand of a woman

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What do you mean?

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's why we don't know

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Alfa, you don't know either?

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, professor

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sorry, professor

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, you can go back to your class

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you think Alfa is suspicious?

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes, she's been quiet

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Maybe she's hiding something

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What if she's with someone?

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How?

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've managed to get the lollipop

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Not yet, sir

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How come?

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
According to the witch, the lollipop is with a woman

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But the woman is not visible

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you know who she is?

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong with you?

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're the one who told us to investigate

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why did you ask?

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're a witch

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not a witch

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're useless

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you, sir

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go back to your class

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Find the lollipop

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes, sir

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Teleportation

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Congratulations

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank God, I'm not punished

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Congratulations

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Congratulations for what?

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, the boss

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No, it's nothing

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Where is he from?

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's from here

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He's sleeping here

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you doing?

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry, sir

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Sit here

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hurry up

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm doing it

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What are you doing?

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't trust you

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Go back

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Boss

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What's wrong?

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I won't let you do this

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not a witch

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Help me

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hurry up

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Help me

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Wake up

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought I was dreaming

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What are you doing?

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Come on

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's go

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Who is it?

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A woman who was kidnapped by a witch

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She said she didn't see me

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I'm here

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Where did you get the ring?

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't remember

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I just realized that I was wearing a ring

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Is the woman I'm talking about a witch?

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Witch

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You can't scare people

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why are you blaming me?

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're the one who's confused

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm thinking about the princess's jewelry

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I suspect

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That thing is in a place we don't expect

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is what I don't like about you

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Too confident

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like a princess

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Just imagine

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can't tell you

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If the ring is in my hand

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a curse

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,140
[the next day]

220
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,140
I can't do this anymore

221
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
I don't want to

222
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,140
[the next day]

223
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,140
How can I feel like someone is coming?

224
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,140
But who?

225
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:13,140
What are you doing?

226
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
What? What are you doing?

227
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
You don't like to play...

228
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,140
from behind

229
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:26,140
You're not happy?

230
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,140
Is this how you play?

231
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,140
From behind?

232
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
You're not happy?

233
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,140
I've been here, you've been there

234
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,140
You can't push me

235
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
I can, but you can't use your legs

236
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
or your arms

237
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
You can't do that

238
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
My legs are strong

239
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,140
You're weak, you like to jump

240
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,140
You can be a stuntman, a top boy

241
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:58,140
I think I'm going crazy

242
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,140
Enough, get in

243
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:07,140
Where is he?

244
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:16,140
I thought he was in the closet

245
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,140
I thought I saw him earlier

246
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
and I saw him, who is he?

247
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,140
I thought I saw him earlier

248
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,140
[the next day]

249
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:36,140
What are you doing?

250
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,140
You're talking to me?

251
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,140
I'm talking to you

252
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,140
Shut up

253
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,140
I'm just making sure

254
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,140
I'm not in the closet

255
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,140
You're lying

256
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,140
You're a liar

257
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,140
Don't talk to me

258
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,140
I'm not talking to you

259
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,140
You're a liar

260
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,140
Tanji, Purwa

261
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,140
Agila

262
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Aguila

263
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Did you see Alfa come in?

264
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
I felt something weird

265
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,140
I felt someone holding my hand

266
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,140
I felt out of breath

267
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,140
But when I woke up, there was no one in the room

268
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Yes, maybe it's true

269
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,140
Alfa just came in

270
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,140
But why did he come to his mother in silence?

271
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:36,140
Did Alfa realize that the ring in Aguila's hand is a gift?

272
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:56,140
Mom!

273
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,140
[music]

274
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Why did this have to happen to me?

275
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
Why?

276
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,140
I can't

277
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
I can't live without you

278
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,140
I can't

279
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
I can't live without you

280
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:48,140
[music]

281
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,140
This is the end of PHASE 2!

282
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:08,140
And that's the conclusion of this episode

283
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,140
Let's meet again in PHASE 3!

284
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,140
PHASE 3

285
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Alpha, where are you from?

286
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,140
What are you doing here?

287
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,140
Yaffa, why did you go out?

288
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,140
You're not even in your room

289
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,140
I had to wake up at night

290
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,140
I was so worried about you

291
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,140
What are you hiding from us?

292
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,140
I'll tell you what I'm hiding

293
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Good evening, students

294
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Good evening

295
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Headmaster, what are you doing here?

296
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:08,140
I'm here to see what your real business is

297
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
What business?

298
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,140
I'm here to see what your real business is

299
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
What business?

300
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm here to see what your real business is

301
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,140
What business?

302
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,140
I'm here to see what your real business is

303
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
What business?

304
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,140
I'm here to see what your real business is

305
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
What business?

306
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,140
I'm here to see what your real business is

307
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:44,140
What? Your mom is alive?

308
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:53,140
Alpha, how is it possible?

309
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,140
You must be lying

310
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,140
Don't exaggerate

311
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
We lost the game

312
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:06,140
You said your mom is alive?

313
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,140
You're lying

314
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
But how?

315
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:21,140
You told us to wake up at 8 AM to wake your parents up

316
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,140
I don't believe you

317
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:32,140
But there's a power that can wake my mom up

318
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,140
We can't meet her

319
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,140
We want to meet her

320
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Okay, but tomorrow

321
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,140
My mom is still sleeping in the old hospital

322
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,140
Okay, but promise me

323
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:01,140
But, I'll tell you the truth

324
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:09,140
So, the soul stone is gone

325
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:15,140
And you two followed Alpha to find the soul stone

326
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Where is the soul stone?

327
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
I don't know

328
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
Don't lie

329
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,140
I'll look for it

330
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,140
The food is gone

331
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,140
The soul stone is in the girl's hand

332
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
But I can't see the girl

333
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,140
I can't see the girl

334
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
You two must be lying

335
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
It's true

336
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Why would we lie?

337
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
It's true

338
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,140
I can't see her

339
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
It's weird

340
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,140
Why is there a girl?

341
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:06,140
That's professor Aldebaran

342
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,140
Where is he?

343
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,140
He's not here

344
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Let's look for him

345
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,140
Let me go

346
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
How can we follow him?

347
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
We can't

348
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,140
I'll let you go

349
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,140
Hurry up

350
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,140
It's taking too long

351
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
Hurry up

352
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
Let's go

353
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Hurry up

354
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,140
You're taking too long

355
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,140
Hurry up

356
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:59,140
We're in trouble

357
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,140
I know this

358
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
Who is this guy?

359
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,140
I don't know

360
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Why are you guys hiding?

361
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,140
There was a professor Aldebaran

362
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,140
He was killed

363
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,140
So we followed him

364
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,140
Aldebaran?

365
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Okay, I'll come with you

366
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,140
Let's go

367
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Good morning, sir

368
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
Professor Aldebaran

369
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,140
Professor

370
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
What is it, professor?

371
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Where is he?

372
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,140
He's still sleeping in his room

373
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:06,140
I'm sorry, everyone

374
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,140
I have to go

375
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,140
What do you need, professor?

376
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,140
This is about the missing ring

377
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,140
The ring is very similar to the ring that Aldebaran used

378
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,140
To be honest

379
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
Since last night

380
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
I've been thinking about this

381
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,140
I've been thinking since madam Gemini told me

382
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,140
That the ring was in the hands of a man

383
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
Wait

384
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
There's something strange, professor

385
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:52,140
If the ring is in the hands of a man

386
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Shouldn't the child have seen it?

387
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,140
Alpha should have told us

388
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Right?

389
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
You're right, professor

390
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Alpha knows

391
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
I'm worried

392
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
He's hiding it

393
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,140
This was done to protect me from you

394
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Panji, you're close to Alpha

395
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,140
I want you to talk to him

396

397
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Okay

402
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,140
I think there's someone here

403
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,140
Don't tell me

I'll go check

If you're late

409
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,140
You'll be kicked out of the school

410
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:30,140
What are you whispering about?

416
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,140
We're just saying

417
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,140
We have a good idea

418

But answer me honestly

Did you come to the professor's office last night?

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Hamster

576
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
Move him to the cage

577
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Welcome, Ankara

578
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:01,140
You're all rude

579
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Now, Ankara's problem is solved

580
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,140
We just have to talk to Alfa

581
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,140
About Jiva's stone

582
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Professor Alfa

583
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,140
If the ring is released from Akila

584
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,140
Isn't it dangerous?

585
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,140
The ring is the source of Ankara's power

586
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,140
If the ring is released

587
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,140
It seems like Akila will fall asleep again

588
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:58,140
That's the ring from Durium

589
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
No

590
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Aquila

591
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
This is Aldebaran

592
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,140
Aquila

593
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,140
Professor Aldebaran

594
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,140
It seems like Akila is still unconscious

595
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
You'd better not disturb her

596
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Urwa

597
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
We have to talk about this

598
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
With Akila

599
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,140
Akila

600
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,140
Here, Ani

601
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,140
Akila should be listening

602
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,140
Don't

603
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
Move

604
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:59,140
Akila is not there

605
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,140
Where is she?

606
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,140
Don't

607
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,140
Alfa has taken Akila away from here

608
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,140
We have to find her

609
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,140
Professor Aldebaran, wait

610
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,140
Ouch

611
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,140
I think I have to go back

612
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
Wait

613
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,140
What's this?

614
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
This is a mess

615
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,140
Let's let the professor find her

616
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,140
No, wait

617
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
I want to find Akila too

618
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
I'll go with you, but don't leave me

619
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
Just one minute

620
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Okay, wait

621
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,140
Hurry up

622
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,140
This is my chance

623
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,140
I have to find Akila and Alfa

624
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,140
And save them

625
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Report

626
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Akila

627
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,140
She's not here either

628
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:08,140
Alfa must have tried to hide Akila

629
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,140
Where is she?

630
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,140
I have to find her

631
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,140
Teleportation

632
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:22,140
Alfa

633
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,140
Akila

634
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
She's not here

635
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Professor Purwadeng, what are you doing here?

636
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,140
You must be looking for a beautiful woman like me

637
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Who are you?

638
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,140
Come here, this is a women's toilet

639
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
I don't care

640
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,140
I'm so tired

641
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,140
Professor Purwadeng, why are you in a women's toilet?

642
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,140
Oh my God

643
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,140
I feel so good

644
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,140
Alfa

645
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,140
Akila

646
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,140
She's not here either

647
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,140
Teleportation

648
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:11,140
Don't be too aggressive

649
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,140
You'll hurt yourself

650
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
Don't be too aggressive

651
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,140
You'll hurt yourself

652
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Guys

653
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,140
Let's talk while eating

654
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,140
Okay, let's eat pizza

655
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,140
That's right, pizza

656
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
Pizza

657
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Let's eat

658
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,140
Let go of me

659
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Wait

660
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Sometimes, we have to drink when we eat

661
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
That's right

662
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140
Let's use syrup

663
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,140
Okay, I'll get the syrup

664
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,140
Wait

665
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
What is it?

666
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,140
Let's prepare the food for auntie first

667
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Then we'll eat

668
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,140
Come on, auntie

669
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,140
Thank you, beautiful girl

670
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,140
Okay

671
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,140
Let's eat

672
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,140
We have to feed Alfa

673
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,140
Sorry, ma'am

674
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:30,140
I'm sorry, auntie

675
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,140
I didn't mean to throw it

676
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,140
It's okay

677
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Let's put our hands on our stomachs

678
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,140
So that she won't be sticky

679
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,140
Don't!

680
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,140
That's the ring from Duyul

681
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,140
No

682
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:57,140
That's right, professor Aldebaran

683
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,140
The ring has a soul stone that belongs to the eighth dimension

684
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
What?

685
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,140
The soul stone

686
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:23,140
That's so long, professor

687
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,140
What is he doing in the toilet?

688
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,140
He's a baby, right?

689
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,140
You try to call him

690
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,140
Okay

691
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:59,140
Professor?

692
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,140
What is it?

693
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,140
Professor, hurry!

694
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,140
I'm sorry, professor

695
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,140
Open it!

696
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:19,140
Professor, we're lying

697
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,140
What do you mean?

698
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,140
Professor is not in the toilet

699
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,140
He lied to us

700
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,140
Yes

701
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,140
Where did he go?

702
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,140
Why did he lie to us?

703
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,140
That's what we have to figure out, professor

704
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,140
Why did he lie to us?

705
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,140
Don't

706
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,140
The priest doesn't agree with our action

707
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,140
You remember

708
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,140
The priest always performs the ritual of the world

709
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,140
Yes

710
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,140
It's true, professor

711
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,140
He deliberately lured us here

712
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,140
So he can lure us to the world

713
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
Let's find him

714
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,140
Teleportation!

715
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:07,140
How can your mother use that ring, Alfa?

716
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,140
I don't know, dear

717
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Suddenly, after I woke up from a long sleep

718
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,140
I found this ring in my hand

719
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,140
We have to let it go

720
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,140
Because we have to destroy the soul stone, right?

721
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
Yes

722
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,140
Don't!

723
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,140
Why not, Alfa?

724
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,140
The soul stone contains the power of darkness

725
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,140
So we have to destroy it

726
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,140
So the power of darkness will be reduced

727
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,140
Yes, Alfa

728
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,140
You're right, dear

729
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,140
Besides, this ring doesn't belong to me

730
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,140
But, dear, don't

731
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Dear, this is the source of my power

732
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,140
If I let go of this ring

733
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,140
I'll fall asleep again

734
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,140
So the ring stone gives power

735
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,140
Send it to Aqilah, so she can be revived

736
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:15,140
So you're all here

737
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,140
Good

738
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Professor, what are you doing here?

739
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:28,140
I'm here to find your mother, Alfa

740
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,140
Professor, don't

741
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,140
Don't take that ring

742
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,140
Don't, Professor

743
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,140
Your mother will wake up

744
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,140
So she can die

745
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,140
Don't, Professor

746
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,140
What are you talking about, Alfa?

747
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,140
I'm here

748
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,140
To help your mother

749
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,140
Before Professor Aldebaran

750
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,140
Or when I came here

751
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
To take that ring from your mother, Alfa

752
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,140
So, Professor is defending my mother?

753
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,140
Yes

754
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,140
They already know about this

755
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,140
So you should leave now

756
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,140
Let's go to the school

757
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,140
Let's go

758
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,140
Rey, are you defending my mother?

759
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140
Of course, Sir

760
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,140
You should meet your mother, Alfa

761
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,140
I don't want to, I'm afraid of my aunt

762
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:25,140
Let's go, Jorim

763
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Yes, Sir

764
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
We don't want to make you sad

765
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,140
I'll do anything to save your mother, Alfa

766
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,140
[The school is in chaos]

767
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:55,140
Why is Professor Purwa like that?

768
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:01,140
Maybe he likes Danta Aquila

769
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,140
[The school is in chaos]

770
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:11,140
Shut up

771
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,140
You don't have to explain

772
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,140
But, I heard that Professor Purwa is heartbroken

773
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,140
Yes, he's been rejected

774
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,140
Really?

775
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,140
Shut up

776
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,140
You don't have to make a scene now

777
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,140
You'd better take your mother away from here

778
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,140
Before Professor Aldebaran or I come back

779
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,140
Okay

780
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,140
But, I'm not sure if what we're doing is right

781
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,140
Aquila, this is all for Alfa

782
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,140
Please

783
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,140
Let's go, what are you waiting for?

784
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,140
Let's go, hurry up

785
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,140
Hurry up

786
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:58,140
Alfa, take your mother away

787

Let's go

788
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:08,140
I don't want to leave you, honey

[We can do this]

790
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:34,140
Alfa and her mother are gone

791

Where are they?

792
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,140
I think Alfa is trying to hide her child

793
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,140
We should chase her, so we can get there faster

794
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,140
Okay, I agree

795
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,140
We'll kill each other when we find one

796
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,140
Okay

Alfa and her child are not here

801
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:21,140
There's another one

802
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,140
What are you doing here?

803
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,140

Where is he?

805
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,140
He's gone

806
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:42,140
Why do you always peek at me?

807
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,140
I'm going to find him

Where are they?

812

Professor, I think they were here

813

Where are they now?

814
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:21,140
We have to get out of here, hurry up

815

Hurry up

816
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,140
But, where are we going?

817
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,140
There's a cave nearby

818
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,140
We can hide there until the situation is safe

819
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:37,140
Let's go

820
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,140
Sir, I can't use this ring

821
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:50,140
If this ring is a stone, we have to destroy it

822
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:57,140
I'm willing to die, as long as I can destroy the darkness

823
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:10,140
Agela, what are you talking about?

824
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:16,140
Don't you think Alfa can lose you?

825
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,140
I'm begging you, don't leave me

826
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,140
I want to be with you

827
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:33,140

I can't use this ring

839

No, Alfa

You can't be stubborn

You have to let this ring go

843

You have to listen to me

Yes, I heard Alfa's voice too

Yes, we don't want to lose you either

Don't make me angry

[Alfa's mother is in danger]

861
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:45,140
But, you have to

862
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,140
Where are you going?

863
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,140
Professor Gemar

864
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,140
I'm not a traitor

865
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:17,140
Purwa has changed

866
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,140
He's a traitor

00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,140
I'm not a traitor

868
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,140
Then, what are you?

I'm just doing

871
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,140
The right thing, in my opinion

872
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,140
A man shouldn't be like this

873
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,140
He deserves to live

874
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,140
A man shouldn't live

875
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,140
Just because he got a ring

876
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,140
He deserves to live

877
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:56,140
Where is he?

878
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,140
Professor Purwa is right

879
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,140
He's right

880
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,140
Yes, Professor Purwa is right

881
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,140
Enough, Cun

882
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,140
Enough

883
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:14,140
The Dark Lord is evil

884
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,140
He wants to rule the world

885
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,140
That's why

886
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,140
Whether he wants to or not

887
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,140
The Soul Stone must be destroyed

888
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,140
But, Professor

889
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,140
There are 12 Soul Stones

890
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,140
We should find the fourth one first

891
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,140
He's right

892
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,140
I agree

893
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,140
Yes, Professor

894
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,140
If we find the fourth one

895
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,140
And the twelfth one

896
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,140
Then, we destroy the third one

897
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,140
Yes, Professor

898
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,140
We should find the eighth one first

899
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
Mom

900
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,140
Let's write it to dad

901
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,140
Right, mom?

902
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,140
So, mom and dad can wake up soon

903

905
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,140
Unfortunately, it's impossible to do

906
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,140
There are steps

907
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,140
If we don't destroy the fifth one

908
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Then, the fourth, fifth and the rest can't be destroyed

909
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,140
And that means

910
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,140
The Dark Lord is getting more and more evil

911
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,140
What do you all want?

912
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
If the Dark Lord wants to rule the world

913
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,140
What do you want?

914
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,140
So, I agree

915
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,140
If we don't destroy it, we'll sleep again

916
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,140
Do you really have no feelings?

917
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,140
Yes, I do

00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,140
Yes, sir

919
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,140

If Bargi can't live without the Ring Stone

921
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Can you imagine?

922
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,140
Don't you have feelings?

923
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,140
Enough, enough

924
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,140
Enough

But all decisions are in your hands

928

Think about it carefully

929

I won't force you

930
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,140
But, Professor

But, Alfa

932
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,140
There's one thing you have to remember

933
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,140
If you want to keep the Ring Stone

934
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,140
Your life will never be peaceful

935
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:30,140

936
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,140
Not only for you

937
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,140

01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,140
I think you're in there

959
01:01:49,140 --> 01:02:01,140
[We can do it]

960
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:10,140
Why is your house in the middle of the road?

961
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:16,140
Jafatang

962
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,140
Follow me

963
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,140
What's going on?

964
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,140
Anggara

965
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,140
Where are you now?

966
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,140
Why haven't you returned to the castle?

967
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,140
Sir

968
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,140
You must remember

969
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,140
Where I am now, sir

970
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:44,140
You're in the gang

971
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,140
Who's Anggara?

972
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,140
How could this happen?

973
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,140
I was arrested

974
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,140
By Aldebaran

975
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,140
Sir

976
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,140
Aldebaran?

977
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,140
You're an idiot

978
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,140
Sir

979
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,140
Please listen to my explanation

980
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,140
Actually

981
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:05,140
I almost got the soul stone, sir

982
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,140
But

983
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,140
Mike, Jack, and Tommy

984
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,140
Betrayed me, sir

985
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,140
You're really an idiot, Anggara

986
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,140
You lost to a kid

987
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,140
I'm sorry, sir

988
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,140
I was careless, sir

989
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,140
But

990
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,140
I got valuable information, sir

991
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,140
It seems

992
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,140
Aldebaran and Mewa

993
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,140
Already know

994
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,140
Where the gang is, sir

995
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,140
Are you sure?

996
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,140
It seems so, sir

997
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,140
Because I saw them whispering, sir

998
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,140
Alright

999
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:41,140
I'll investigate further

1000
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,140
Then

1001
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,140
Tommy, Mike, and Jack

1002
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,140
What now, sir?

1003
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,140
If they're really betraying me

1004
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,140
I'll investigate further

1005
01:03:51,140 --> 01:04:17,140
Who are you?

1006
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,140
I'm Pangen Redilang

1007
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,140
I want to tell you

1008
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:26,140
That I know where your gang is

1009
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,140
Don't lie

1010
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,140
I'm not lying

1011
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,140
If you really know

1012
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,140
Where is it?

1013
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,140
Aldebaran

1014
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:36,140
The leader of Sekolah Segeri

1015
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,140
Your gang is there

1016
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:45,140
You've come to Sekolah Segeri

1017
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,140
We've even explored

1018
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,140
The hideouts we suspected

1019
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,140
But

1020
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,140
We didn't find anything

1021
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,140
They've hidden it

1022
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,140
So you can't take this gang

1023
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,140
Alright

1024
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,140
Then

1025
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,140
We have to go back and look for it

1026
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,140
We have to unite our strength

1027
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,140
To defeat Aldebaran

1028
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,140
We agree

1029
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,140
We work together

1030
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,140
To defeat Aldebaran

1031
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,140
Good

1032
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,140
[Chuckles]

1033
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:19,140
If it's like this

1034
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,140
I'm easier to defeat Aldebaran

1035
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:26,140
Let's go

1036
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,140
We have to go

1037
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:30,140
The hideout must be found

1038
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:34,140
Wait

1039
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,140
What now?

1040
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,140
Search for it

1041
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:51,140
What do you want to do with our gang?

1042
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,140
[Chuckles]

1043
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,140
That's a protection spell

1044
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,140
From now on

1045
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:00,140
You can't be attacked by Irfan's spell

1046
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:06,140
Let's go

1047
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:10,140
Aldebaran

1048
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,140
Who's the traitor?

1049
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:24,140
Everyone

1050
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:31,140
What do you think?

1051
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,140
Here

1052
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,140
In this cave

1053
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,140
We can stay for a while

1054
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,140
Wait

1055
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,140
This is wrong, Purwa

1056
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,140
This is not right

1057
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,140
You're an adult

1058
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,140
And you're a teacher

1059
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,140
Please think rationally

1060
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,140
Don't support them

1061
01:06:52,140 --> 01:07:02,140
What did I say?

1062
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,140
With mom?

1063
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,140
You want to leave me?

1064
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:10,140
I'm sorry

1065
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:14,140
I miss you too, son

1066
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:18,140
I want to be with you forever

1067
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:22,140
But we can't be selfish

1068
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,140
We can't be selfish

1069
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,140
As long as the 8th prince is still in power

1070
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,140
It's dangerous

1071
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,140
Everything can be destroyed

1072
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,140
Irfan

1073
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,140
Wake up

1074
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,140

[Laughs]

1076
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:32,140
Now Aldebaran is trapped

[Laughs]

1078
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:41,140
Alapak

1079
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:45,140
You have to be strong

1080
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,140
You can do it

1081
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:55,140
[Sighs]

1082
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,140
[Laughs]

1083
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:02,140
Finally

1084
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,140
He brought his soul here

1085
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,140
