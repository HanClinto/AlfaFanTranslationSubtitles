 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

 Run, jump, jump, we are the champions

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 To be continued...

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 This is our heritage

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Why is it used by you?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 No, it's impossible

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 It must be similar

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Aldebaran, our kingdom's heirloom

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And according to the power of the gods, the heirloom is in one of the buildings of this school

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 How is it possible that the heirloom is here?

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 The heirloom is in a woman with long hair, fair skin

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And the woman is here

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 What she meant was me

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But how is it possible that I'm wearing a heirloom?

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I haven't seen them for a long time

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 What is this?

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I'm confused

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 What does this mean?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Don't you know?

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Me neither

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Are you done?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Yes, professor

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 That's it? You're not strong enough?

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 You're a coward

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Then, let's go down

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Let's go down

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Come on

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Come on

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 You almost stepped on me

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 How is it?

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 The heirloom can't be seen by the woman

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Then, how?

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I don't know

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Just think about it, Rick

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 You're a coward

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So, Alva and her friends didn't go to class

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Where are they?

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I don't know, professor

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Tommy said they were not here last night

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So, I came to the professor

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I think the professor knows where they are

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Usually, I know

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 But this time, they didn't say anything about me

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And I haven't heard about them

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 [The professor is looking for the heirloom]

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 I'm sorry, professor

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Did you see professor Purwa?

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Purwa?

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 So, professor Purwa is not here

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I've been looking for him

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But I haven't found him yet

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Where are they?

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 [The professor is looking for the heirloom]

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 We can escape if we have the heirloom

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 If not, we'll be kidnapped by the witch

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I'm still confused about what the heirloom means

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Alva, do you understand?

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Alva, do you understand?

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 No

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I don't understand

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I don't understand either

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I don't understand either

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 What's wrong with him?

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Kids

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 What's wrong with him?

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Mr. Panji, why are you here?

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 We've been following you

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 So, have you found the heirloom?

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Not yet

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The witch said that the heirloom is a woman's hand

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So, we're confused

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Maybe the witch is a witch

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Okay

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Now, let's go back to school

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I'll punish you because you're lazy

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Do you understand?

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 We're lazy?

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So, the professor is also lazy

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 The professor is here, right?

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Right?

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Yes

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Professor is lazy

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Shut up!

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 You guys

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Now, take out your lollipop

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Come on

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 But, professor

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 No buts

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Come on

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 The Witch's Hand

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Everyone, on the count of three

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 One, two, three

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Fly!

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Alva

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 What's wrong?

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Why don't you fly?

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Nothing

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Nothing?

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Mr. Panji

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Alva

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Yes, ma'am

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 What's wrong?

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Do you still remember what the witch said?

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Of course

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 What's wrong?

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Nothing, ma'am

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I just feel like

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 She meant you

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Maybe the lollipop you're wearing

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Is the witch's hand

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Impossible, ma'am

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 The witch's hand can't be mine

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Enough, ma'am

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I don't want to think about it anymore

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Go!

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I can't tell you

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 If the witch's hand is really the witch's hand

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I want to find the evidence

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Professor is inside

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Sorry, we're not allowed to go to school

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Without permission from the professor

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You don't have to apologize

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'm glad you can take the kids home safely

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 You two, please come in

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I want to talk to the kids

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Yes, professor

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Where did you go last night?

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 We're looking for information about the lollipop

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Professor, the witch said

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 The lollipop is in the hand of a woman

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 What do you mean?

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 That's why we don't know

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Alva, you don't know either?

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 No, professor

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Sorry, professor

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Okay, you can go back to your class

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Do you think Alva is suspicious?

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Yes, she's been quiet

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Maybe she's hiding something

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 What if she's with someone?

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 How?

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 You've managed to get the lollipop

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Not yet, sir

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 How come?

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 According to the witch, the lollipop is with a woman

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 But the woman is not visible

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Do you know who she is?

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 What's wrong with you?

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 You're the one who told us to investigate

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Why did you ask?

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 You're a witch

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I'm not a witch

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You're useless

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Thank you, sir

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Go back to your class

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Find the lollipop

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Yes, sir

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Teleportation

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Congratulations

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Thank God, I'm not punished

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Congratulations

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Congratulations for what?

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Oh, the boss

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 No, it's nothing

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Where is he from?

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 He's from here

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 He's sleeping here

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 What are you doing?

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I'm sorry, sir

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Sit here

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Hurry up

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I'm doing it

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 What are you doing?

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I don't trust you

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Go back

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Boss

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000

00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
 We can't

386
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,140
 I'll let you go

387
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,140
 Hurry up

388
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,140
 It's taking too long

389
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
 Hurry up

390
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
 Let's go

391
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
 Hurry up

392
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,140
 You're taking too long

393
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,140
 Hurry up

394
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,140
 Hurry up

395
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,140
 We're in trouble

396
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
 We're in trouble

397
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
 We're in trouble

398
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,140
 We're in trouble

399
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,140
 We're in trouble

400
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,140
 I know this

401
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,140
 I know this

402
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
 Who is this guy?

403
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,140
 I don't know

404
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,140
 Why are you guys hiding?

405
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,140
 There was a professor Aldebaran

406
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,140
 He was killed

407
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,140
 So we followed him

408
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,140
 Aldebaran?

409
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,140
 Okay, I'll come with you

410
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,140
 Let's go

411
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:44,140
 Good morning, sir

412
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
 Professor Aldebaran

413
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,140
 Professor

414
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
 What is it, professor?

415
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,140
 Where is he?

416
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,140
 He's still sleeping in his room

417
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:06,140
 I'm sorry, everyone

418
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,140
 I have to go

419
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,140
 What do you need, professor?

420
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,140
 This is about the missing ring

421
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,140
 The ring is very similar to the ring that Aldebaran used

422
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,140
 To be honest

423
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
 Since last night

424
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
 I've been thinking about this

425
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,140
 I've been thinking since madam Gemini told me

426
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,140
 That the ring was in the hands of a man

427
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
 Wait

428
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
 There's something strange, professor

429
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:52,140
 If the ring is in the hands of a man

430
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,140
 Shouldn't the child have seen it?

431
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,140
 Alpha should have told us

432
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
 Right?

433
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
 You're right, professor

434
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
 Alpha knows

435
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
 I'm worried

436
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
 He's hiding it

437
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,140
 This was done to protect me from you

438
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,140
 Panji, you're close to Alpha

439
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,140
 I want you to talk to him

440
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,140
 You decide what to do

441
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
 Okay

442
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,140
 What are they talking about?

443
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
 It's so loud

444
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,140
 We're so close

445
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,140
 What's that sound?

446
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,140
 I think there's someone here

447
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,140
 Don't tell me

448
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,140
 Alde is following us

449
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:57,140
 Sorry, sir

450
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,140
 Sorry

451
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,140
 I'll go check

452
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,140
 If you're late

453
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,140
 You'll be kicked out of the school

454
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
 I'm sorry, sir

455
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
 I'll go check

456
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
 I'll be kicked out of the school

457
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
 I'm sorry

458
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,140
 I have a good idea

459
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:30,140
 What are you whispering about?

460
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,140
 We're just saying

461
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,140
 We have a good idea

462
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,140
 Let's go over there

463
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,140
 So we can hear it better

464
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
 Okay, let's go

465
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,140
 What should I do now?

466
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,140
 I don't want to lose you

467
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:17,140
 Alpha

468
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,140
 Mom?

469
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
 I think I hear her voice

470
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
 Mom?

471
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,140
 Alpha, I'm here

472
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,140
 Mom?

473
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,140
 Why are you here?

474
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,140
 I have something important to tell you

475
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:45,140
 Let's talk somewhere else

476
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
 How about here?

477
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:57,140
 Let's talk in the school yard

478
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,140
 I have something to tell you

479
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
 Let's go

480
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
 Okay

481
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:32,140
 What are you doing?

482
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
 You're so smelly

483
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:42,140
 Yes, professor

484
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
 I'm also a teacher

485
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,140
 This means there's someone around here

486
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,140
 Who's trying to...

487
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
 Kill us

488
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,140
 Where?

489
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,140
 I'm getting more and more nervous

490
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,140
 Let's run away

491
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,140
 Now!

492
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:10,140
 You're so mean

493
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,140
 You traitor!

494
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:23,140
 You're the traitor

495
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,140
 How dare you

496
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
 You're following us

497
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
 What do you want?

498
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:46,140
 Alpha

499
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,140
 I have a question for you

500
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,140
 But answer me honestly

501
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
 What is it?

502
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,140
 Did you come to the professor's office last night?

503
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,140
 Even though I'm sleeping

504
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,140
 I can feel your presence

505
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,140
 Yes, mom

506
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,140
 I went there last night

507
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
 Then why are you so quiet?

508
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,140
 Why didn't you wake me up?

509
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,140
 Alpha

510
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,140
 Why are you crying?

511
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,140
 What's wrong?

512
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:36,140
 Mom, I have a favor to ask

513
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,140
 What favor?

514
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:45,140
 I...

515
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,140
 Want...

516
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,140
 What?

517
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,140
 I want to introduce you to my friends

518
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,140
 You want to introduce me to your friends?

519
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,140
 Isn't that dangerous?

520
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
 Calm down, mom

521
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,140
 My friends are nice

522
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,140
 They can keep secrets

523
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,140
 You want that, right?

524
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,140
 Because they want to get to know you

525
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
 Alright

526
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,140
 If that's what you want

527
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
 I'm okay with it

528
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,140
 Then, I'll get married first

529
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
 So I can be pretty

530
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,140
 What's wrong with that?

531
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,140
 I want to be a rich girl

532
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:39,140
 So, you're getting married?

533
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
 Yes

534
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
 Okay, I'll help you

535
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
 Hey!

536
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,140
 Hey!

537
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,140
 Hey!

538
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,140
 Hey!

539
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,140
 Show your spirit, get ready to find your friends

540
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:09,140
 Run, jump, jump, chase the stars

541
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,140
 Dare to say no

542
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,140
 Chase your dream

543
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,140
 How was it?

544
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
 It was so cool

545
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,140
 I think there's something missing

546
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
 What?

547
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
 You have to change your clothes

548
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,140
 Let me see

549
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,140
 Gavanti Bafajuh

550
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:48,140
 It's so pretty

551
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,140
 What else?

552
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,140
 I think there's something missing

553
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,140
 One more thing

554
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,140
 What?

555
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
 You have to wear a glove

556
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,140
 Glove?

557
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
 What for?

558
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,140
 So you can be prettier

559
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,140
 Do you want it?

560
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,140
 Okay, I'll do it

561
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
 What's wrong with you?

562
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
 Come here

563
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,140
 Listen to me

564
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
 You can't see

565
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,140
 If I'm wearing a ring like before

566
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,140
 I'm sorry, guys

567
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,140
 I have to do this

568
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,140
 Because I still want to be with you

569
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,140
 Forever

570
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:53,140
 Don't forget, I'm still here

571
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,140
 I'm not a Teguh Skut

572
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
 I'm a hamster

573
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
 Okay, get ready

574
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
 [Gunshots]

575
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:18,140
 Where's the other one?

576
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
 I don't know

577
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
 [Gunshots]

578
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
 [Gunshots]

774
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,140
 Suddenly, after I woke up from a long sleep

775
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,140
 I found this ring in my hand

776
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,140
 We have to let it go

777
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,140
 Because we have to destroy the soul stone, right?

778
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
 Yes

779
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,140
 Don't!

780
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,140
 Why not, Alva?

781
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,140
 The soul stone contains the power of darkness

782
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,140
 So we have to destroy it

783
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,140
 So the power of darkness will be reduced

784
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,140
 Yes, Alva

785
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,140
 You're right, dear

786
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,140
 Besides, this ring doesn't belong to me

787
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,140
 But, dear, don't

788
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,140
 Dear, this is the source of my power

789
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,140
 If I let go of this ring

790
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,140
 I'll fall asleep again

791
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,140
 So the ring stone gives power

792
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,140
 Send it to Aqilah, so she can be revived

793
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:15,140
 So you're all here

794
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,140
 Good

795
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,140
 Professor, what are you doing here?

796
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:28,140
 I'm here to find your mother, Alva

797
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,140
 Professor, don't

798
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,140
 Don't take that ring

799
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,140
 Don't, Professor

800
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,140
 Your mother will wake up

801
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,140
 So she can die

802
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,140
 Don't, Professor

803
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,140
 What are you talking about, Alva?

804
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,140
 I'm here

805
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,140
 To help your mother

806
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,140
 Before Professor Aldebaran

807
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,140
 Or when I came here

808
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
 To take that ring from your mother, Alva

809
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,140
 So, Professor is defending my mother?

810
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,140
 Yes

811
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,140
 They already know about this

812
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,140
 So you should leave now

813
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,140
 Let's go to the school

814
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,140
 Let's go

815
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,140
 Rey, are you defending my mother?

816
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140
 Of course, Sir

817
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,140
 You should meet your mother, Alva

818
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,140
 I don't want to, I'm afraid of my aunt

819
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:25,140
 Let's go, Jorim

820
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,140
 Yes, Sir

821
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
 We don't want to make you sad

822
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,140
 I'll do anything to save your mother, Alva

823
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,140
 [The school is in chaos]

824
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:55,140
 Why is Professor Purwa like that?

825
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:01,140
 Maybe he likes Danta Aquila

826
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,140
 [The school is in chaos]

827
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:11,140
 Shut up

828
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,140
 You don't have to explain

829
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,140
 But, I heard that Professor Purwa is heartbroken

830
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,140
 Yes, he's been rejected

831
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,140
 Really?

832
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,140
 Shut up

833
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,140
 You don't have to make a scene now

834
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,140
 You'd better take your mother away from here

835
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,140
 Before Professor Aldebaran or I come back

836
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,140
 Okay

837
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,140
 But, I'm not sure if what we're doing is right

838
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,140
 Aquila, this is all for Alva

839
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,140
 Please

840
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,140
 Let's go, what are you waiting for?

841
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,140
 Let's go, hurry up

842
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,140
 Hurry up

843
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:58,140
 Alva, take your mother away

844
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,140
 Let's go

845
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:08,140
 I don't want to leave you, honey

846
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:15,140
 [We can do this]

847
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:25,140
 [We can do this]

848
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:34,140
 Alva and her mother are gone

849
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,140
 Where are they?

850
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,140
 I think Alva is trying to hide her child

851
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,140
 We should chase her, so we can get there faster

852
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,140
 Okay, I agree

853
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,140
 We'll kill each other when we find one

854
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,140
 Okay

855
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,140
 Teleportation

856
00:51:53,140 --> 00:52:01,140
 The children are not here

857
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,140
 Teleportation

858
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:15,140
 Alva and her child are not here

859
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:21,140
 There's another one

860
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,140
 What are you doing here?

861
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,140
 Teleportation

862
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:30,140
 Where is he?

863
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,140
 He's gone

864
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:42,140
 Why do you always peek at me?

865
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,140
 I'm going to find him

866
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:53,140
 Food delivery

867
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,140
 I think Alva and her child are here

868
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,140
 [We can do this]

869
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:07,140
 Where are they?

870
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:12,140
 Professor, I think they were here

871
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,140
 Where are they now?

872
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:21,140
 We have to get out of here, hurry up

873
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,140
 Hurry up

874
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,140
 But, where are we going?

875
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,140
 There's a cave nearby

876
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,140
 We can hide there until the situation is safe

877
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:37,140
 Let's go

878
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,140
 Sir, I can't use this ring

879
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:50,140
 If this ring is a stone, we have to destroy it

880
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:57,140
 I'm willing to die, as long as I can destroy the darkness

881
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:10,140
 Agela, what are you talking about?

882
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:16,140
 Don't you think Alva can lose you?

883
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,140
 I'm begging you, don't leave me

884
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,140
 I want to be with you

885
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:33,140
 We don't want to lose you either

886
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,140
 I don't want to leave you either

887
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,140
 Yes, I'm sorry

888
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,140
 Don't leave me

889
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,140
 [Alva's mother is in danger]

890
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:59,140
 But, we have to let this ring go

891
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,140
 I'm sorry, Mom

892
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:08,140
 I don't want to leave you again

893
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:12,140
 I don't want to leave you

894
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,140
 [Alva's mother is in danger]

895
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:20,140
 Alva, you have to listen to me

896
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,140
 I can't use this ring

897
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,140
 But, Mom

898
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,140
 No, Alva

899
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,140
 You can't be stubborn

900
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,140
 You have to let this ring go

901
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,140
 You have to listen to me

902
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,140
 But, Mom

903
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,140
 Don't, Dad

904
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:56,140
 Mom, don't

905
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,140
 You have to listen to me

906
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,140
 Dad, I heard something

907
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:05,140
 Yes, I heard Alva's voice too

908
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,140
 That's them, let's go there

909
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,140
 What's wrong, Dad?

910
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,140
 You can't use this ring

911
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,140
 But, you have to let this ring go

912

 You have to listen to me

913

 Yes, we don't want to lose you either

914

916
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,140
 Don't make me angry

 [Alva's mother is in danger]

919
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:45,140
 But, you have to

920
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,140
 Where are you going?

921
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,140
 Professor Gemar

922
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,140
 I'm not a traitor

923
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:17,140
 Purwa has changed

924
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,140
 He's a traitor

925
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,140
 I'm not a traitor

926
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,140
 Then, what are you?

927
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,140
 If you're not a traitor

928
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,140
 I'm just doing

929
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,140
 The right thing, in my opinion

930
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,140
 A man shouldn't be like this

931
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,140
 He deserves to live

932
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,140
 A man shouldn't live

933
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,140
 Just because he got a ring

934
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,140
 He deserves to live

935
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:56,140
 Where is he?

936
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,140
 Professor Purwa is right

937
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,140
 He's right

938
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,140
 Yes, Professor Purwa is right

939
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,140
 Enough, Cun

940
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,140
 Enough

941
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:14,140
 The Dark Lord is evil

942
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,140
 He wants to rule the world

943
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,140
 That's why

944
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,140
 Whether he wants to or not

945
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,140
 The Soul Stone must be destroyed

946
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,140
 But, Professor

947
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,140
 There are 12 Soul Stones

948
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,140
 We should find the fourth one first

949
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,140
 He's right

950
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,140
 I agree

951
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,140
 Yes, Professor

952
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,140
 If we find the fourth one

953
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,140
 And the twelfth one

954
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,140
 Then, we destroy the third one

955
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,140
 Yes, Professor

956
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,140
 We should find the eighth one first

957
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
 Mom

958
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,140
 Let's write it to dad

959
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,140
 Right, mom?

960

 So, mom and dad can wake up soon

 Unfortunately, it's impossible to do

00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,140
 There are steps

965
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,140
 If we don't destroy the fifth one

966
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:13,140
 Then, the fourth, fifth and the rest can't be destroyed

967
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,140
 And that means

968
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,140

969

 What do you all want?

970
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
 If the Dark Lord wants to rule the world

971
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,140
 What do you want?

972
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,140
 So, I agree

973
