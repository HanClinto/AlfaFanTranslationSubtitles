00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, jump, jump, we are the champions

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To be continued...

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is our heritage

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why is it used by you?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, it's impossible

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It must be similar

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Aldebaran, our kingdom's heirloom

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And according to the power of the gods, the heirloom is in one of the buildings of this school

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How is it possible that the heirloom is here?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The heirloom is in a woman with long hair, fair skin

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the woman is here

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What she meant was me

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But how is it possible that I'm wearing a heirloom?

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I haven't seen them for a long time

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What is this?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm confused

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What does this mean?

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't you know?

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Me neither

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you done?

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, professor

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's it? You're not strong enough?

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're a coward

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then, let's go down

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's go down

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come on

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You almost stepped on me

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How is it?

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The heirloom can't be seen by the woman

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then, how?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just think about it, Rick

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're a coward

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, Alva and her friends didn't go to class

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Where are they?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know, professor

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tommy said they were not here last night

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, I came to the professor

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think the professor knows where they are

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Usually, I know

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But this time, they didn't say anything about me

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I haven't heard about them

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
[The professor is looking for the heirloom]

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry, professor

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did you see professor Purwa?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Purwa?

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, professor Purwa is not here

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've been looking for him

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I haven't found him yet

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Where are they?

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
[The professor is looking for the heirloom]

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We can escape if we have the heirloom

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If not, we'll be kidnapped by the witch

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm still confused about what the heirloom means

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alva, do you understand?

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't understand

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't understand either

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's wrong with him?

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Kids

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What's wrong with him?

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mr. Panji, why are you here?

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We've been following you

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So, have you found the heirloom?

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Not yet

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The witch said that the heirloom is a woman's hand

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, we're confused

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Maybe the witch is a witch

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, let's go back to school

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll punish you because you're lazy

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you understand?

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We're lazy?

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, the professor is also lazy

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The professor is here, right?

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Right?

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Professor is lazy

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Shut up!

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You guys

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now, take out your lollipop

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Come on

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But, professor

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No buts

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Come on

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The Witch's Hand

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Everyone, on the count of three

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
One, two, three

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Fly!

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alva

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What's wrong?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why don't you fly?

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nothing

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nothing?

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Panji

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Alva

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, ma'am

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's wrong?

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you still remember what the witch said?

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Of course

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What's wrong?

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Nothing, ma'am

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I just feel like

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
She meant you

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Maybe the lollipop you're wearing

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is the witch's hand

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Impossible, ma'am

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The witch's hand can't be mine

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Enough, ma'am

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't want to think about it anymore

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Go!

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't tell you

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If the witch's hand is really the witch's hand

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I want to find the evidence

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Professor is inside

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Sorry, we're not allowed to go to school

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Without permission from the professor

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You don't have to apologize

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm glad you can take the kids home safely

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You two, please come in

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to talk to the kids

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, professor

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Where did you go last night?

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We're looking for information about the lollipop

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Professor, the witch said

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The lollipop is in the hand of a woman

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What do you mean?

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's why we don't know

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Alva, you don't know either?

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, professor

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sorry, professor

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, you can go back to your class

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you think Alva is suspicious?

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes, she's been quiet

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Maybe she's hiding something

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What if she's with someone?

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How?

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've managed to get the lollipop

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Not yet, sir

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How come?

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
According to the witch, the lollipop is with a woman

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But the woman is not visible

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you know who she is?

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong with you?

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're the one who told us to investigate

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why did you ask?

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're a witch

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not a witch

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're useless

Go back to your class

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Find the lollipop

No, it's nothing

Where is he from?

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's from here

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He's sleeping here

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you doing?

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry, sir

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000

I don't trust you

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000

What's wrong?

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I won't let you do this

190

Wake up

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought I was dreaming

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What are you doing?

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A woman who was kidnapped by a witch

199
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She said she didn't see me

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I'm here

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Where did you get the ring?

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't remember

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I just realized that I was wearing a ring

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Is the woman I'm talking about a witch?

Why are you blaming me?

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're the one who's confused

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000

He was killed

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,140
This is about the missing ring

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,140
The ring is very similar to the ring that Aldebaran used

380
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,140

There's something strange, professor

387
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:52,140
If the ring is in the hands of a man

388
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Shouldn't the child have seen it?

389
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,140
Alpha should have told us

390
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Right?

391
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
You're right, professor

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Hamster

579
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
Move him to the cage

580
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Welcome, Ankara

581
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:01,140
You're all rude

582
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Now, Ankara's problem is solved

583
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,140
We just have to talk to Alva

584
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,140
About Jiva's stone

585
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Professor Alva

586
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,140
If the ring is released from Akila

587
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,140
Isn't it dangerous?

588
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,140
The ring is the source of Ankara's power

589
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,140
If the ring is released

590
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,140
It seems like Akila will fall asleep again

591
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,140
[Music]

592
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:58,140
That's the ring from Durium

593
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
No

594
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:09,140
[Music]

595
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Aquila

596
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
This is Aldebaran

597
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,140
Aquila

598
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,140
Professor Aldebaran

599
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,140
It seems like Akila is still unconscious

600
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
You'd better not disturb her

601
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Urwa

602
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
We have to talk about this

603
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
With Akila

604
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,140
Akila

605
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,140
Here, Ani

606
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,140
Akila should be listening

607
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,140
Don't

608
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
Move

609
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:59,140
Akila is not there

610
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,140
Where is she?

611
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,140
Don't

612
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,140
Alva has taken Akila away from here

613
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,140
We have to find her

614
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,140
Professor Aldebaran, wait

615
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,140
Ouch

616
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,140
I think I have to go back

617
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
Wait

618
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,140
What's this?

619
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
This is a mess

620
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,140
Let's let the professor find her

621
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,140
No, wait

622
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
I want to find Akila too

623
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
I'll go with you, but don't leave me

624
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
Just one minute

625
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Okay, wait

626
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,140
Hurry up

627
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,140
This is my chance

628
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,140
I have to find Akila and Alva

629
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,140
And save them

630
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Report

631
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Akila

632
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,140
She's not here either

633
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:08,140
Alva must have tried to hide Akila

634
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,140
Where is she?

635
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,140
I have to find her

636
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,140
Teleportation

637
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:22,140
Alva

638
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,140
Akila

639
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
She's not here

640
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Professor Purwadeng, what are you doing here?

641
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,140
You must be looking for a beautiful woman like me

642
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Who are you?

643
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,140
Come here, this is a women's toilet

644
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
I don't care

645
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,140
I'm so tired

646
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,140
Professor Purwadeng, why are you in a women's toilet?

647
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,140
Oh my God

648
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,140
I feel so good

649
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,140
Alva

650
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,140
Akila

651
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,140
She's not here either

652
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,140
Teleportation

653
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:11,140
Don't be too aggressive

654
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,140
You'll hurt yourself

655
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
Don't be too aggressive

656
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,140
You'll hurt yourself

657
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Guys

658
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,140
Let's talk while eating

659
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,140
Okay, let's eat pizza

660
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,140
That's right, pizza

661
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
Pizza

662
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Let's eat

663
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,140
Let go of me

664
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Wait

665
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Sometimes, we have to drink when we eat

666
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
That's right

667
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140
Let's use syrup

668
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,140
Okay, I'll get the syrup

669
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,140
Wait

670
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
What is it?

671
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,140
Let's prepare the food for auntie first

672
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Then we'll eat

673
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,140
Come on, auntie

674
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,140
Thank you, beautiful girl

675
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,140
Okay

676
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,140
Let's eat

677
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,140
We have to feed Alva

678
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,140
Sorry, ma'am

679
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:30,140
I'm sorry, auntie

680
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,140
I didn't mean to throw it

681
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,140
It's okay

682
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Let's put our hands on our stomachs

683
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,140
So that she won't be sticky

684
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,140
Don't!

685
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,140
That's the ring from Duyul

686
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,140
No

687
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:57,140
That's right, professor Aldebaran

688
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,140
The ring has a soul stone that belongs to the eighth dimension

689
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
What?

690
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,140
The soul stone

691
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:23,140
That's so long, professor

692
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,140
What is he doing in the toilet?

693
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,140
He's a baby, right?

694
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,140
You try to call him

695
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,140
Okay

696
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:59,140
Professor?

697
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,140
What is it?

698
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,140
Professor, hurry!

699
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,140
I'm sorry, professor

700
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,140
Open it!

701
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:19,140
Professor, we're lying

702
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,140
What do you mean?

703
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,140
Professor is not in the toilet

704
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,140
He lied to us

705
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,140
Yes

706
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,140
Where did he go?

707
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,140
Why did he lie to us?

708
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,140
That's what we have to figure out, professor

709
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,140
Why did he lie to us?

710
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,140
Don't

711
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,140
The priest doesn't agree with our action

712
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,140
You remember

713
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,140
The priest always performs the ritual of the world

714
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,140
Yes

715
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,140
It's true, professor

716
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,140
He deliberately lured us here

717
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,140
So he can lure us to the world

718
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
Let's find him

719
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,140
Teleportation!

720
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:07,140
How can your mother use that ring, Alva?

721
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,140
I don't know, dear

722
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Suddenly, after I woke up from a long sleep

723
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,140
I found this ring in my hand

724
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,140
We have to let it go

725
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,140
Because we have to destroy the soul stone, right?

726
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
Yes

727
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,140
Don't!

728
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,140
Why not, Alva?

729
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,140
The soul stone contains the power of darkness

730
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,140
So we have to destroy it

731
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,140
So the power of darkness will be reduced

732
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,140
Yes, Alva

733
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,140
You're right, dear

734
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,140
Besides, this ring doesn't belong to me

735
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,140
But, dear, don't

736
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Dear, this is the source of my power

737
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,140
If I let go of this ring

738
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,140
I'll fall asleep again

739
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,140
So the ring stone gives power

740
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,140
Send it to Aqilah, so she can be revived

741
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:15,140
So you're all here

742
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,140
Good

743
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Professor, what are you doing here?

744
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:28,140
I'm here to find your mother, Alva

745
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,140
Professor, don't

746
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,140
Don't take that ring

747
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,140
Don't, Professor

748
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,140
Your mother will wake up

749
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,140
So she can die

750
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,140
Don't, Professor

751
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,140
What are you talking about, Alva?

752
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,140
I'm here

753
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,140
To help your mother

754
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,140
Before Professor Aldebaran

755
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,140
Or when I came here

756
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
To take that ring from your mother, Alva

757
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,140
So, Professor is defending my mother?

758
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,140
Yes

759
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,140
They already know about this

760
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,140
So you should leave now

761
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,140
Let's go to the school

762
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,140
Let's go

763
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,140
Rey, are you defending my mother?

764
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140
Of course, Sir

765
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,140
You should meet your mother, Alva

766
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,140
I don't want to, I'm afraid of my aunt

767
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:25,140
Let's go, Jorim

768
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Yes, Sir

769
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
We don't want to make you sad

770
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,140
I'll do anything to save your mother, Alva

771
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,140
[The school is in chaos]

772
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:55,140
Why is Professor Purwa like that?

773
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:01,140
Maybe he likes Danta Aquila

774
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,140
[The school is in chaos]

775
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:11,140
Shut up

776
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,140
You don't have to explain

777
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,140
But, I heard that Professor Purwa is heartbroken

778
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,140
Yes, he's been rejected

779
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,140
Really?

780
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,140
Shut up

781
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,140
You don't have to make a scene now

782
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,140
You'd better take your mother away from here

783
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,140
Before Professor Aldebaran or I come back

784
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,140
Okay

785
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,140
But, I'm not sure if what we're doing is right

786
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,140
Aquila, this is all for Alva

787
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,140
Please

788
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,140
Let's go, what are you waiting for?

789
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,140
Let's go, hurry up

790
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,140
Hurry up

791
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:58,140
Alva, take your mother away

792
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,140
Let's go

793
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:08,140
I don't want to leave you, honey

794
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:25,140
[We can do this]

795
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:34,140
Alva and her mother are gone

796
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,140
Where are they?

797
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,140
I think Alva is trying to hide her child

798
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,140
We should chase her, so we can get there faster

799
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,140
Okay, I agree

800
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,140
We'll kill each other when we find one

801
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,140
Okay

There's another one

807
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,140
What are you doing here?

808

Teleportation

809

Where is he?

810
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,140
He's gone

811
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:42,140
Why do you always peek at me?

812
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,140
I'm going to find him

Where are they?

817

Professor, I think they were here

818
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,140
Where are they now?

819
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:21,140
We have to get out of here, hurry up

Hurry up

821
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,140
But, where are we going?

822
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,140
There's a cave nearby

823
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,140
We can hide there until the situation is safe

824
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:37,140
Let's go

825
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,140
Sir, I can't use this ring

826
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:50,140
If this ring is a stone, we have to destroy it

827
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:57,140
I'm willing to die, as long as I can destroy the darkness

828
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:10,140
Agela, what are you talking about?

829
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:16,140
Don't you think Alva can lose you?

830
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,140
I'm begging you, don't leave me

831
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,140
I want to be with you

832
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:33,140

842
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:20,140
Alva, you have to listen to me

843

I can't use this ring

844

But, Mom

845
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,140
No, Alva

You can't be stubborn

You have to let this ring go

848
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,140
You have to listen to me

849

Yes, I heard Alva's voice too

[Alva's mother is in danger]

866

But, you have to

867
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,140
Where are you going?

868

I'm not a traitor

871

I'm not a traitor

873

876
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,140
The right thing, in my opinion

877
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,140
A man shouldn't be like this

878
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,140
He deserves to live

879
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,140
A man shouldn't live

880
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,140
Just because he got a ring

881
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,140
He deserves to live

882

He's right

885
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,140
Yes, Professor Purwa is right

886
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,140
Enough, Cun

887
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,140
Enough

888
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:14,140
The Dark Lord is evil

889
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,140
He wants to rule the world

890
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,140
That's why

891
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,140
Whether he wants to or not

892
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,140
The Soul Stone must be destroyed

893
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,140
But, Professor

894
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,140
There are 12 Soul Stones

895
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,140
We should find the fourth one first

896
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,140
He's right

897
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,140
I agree

898
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,140
Yes, Professor

899
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,140
If we find the fourth one

900
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,140
And the twelfth one

901
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,140
Then, we destroy the third one

902
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,140
Yes, Professor

903
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,140
We should find the eighth one first

904
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
Mom

905
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,140
Let's write it to dad

906
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,140
Right, mom?

907
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,140
So, mom and dad can wake up soon

908

910
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,140
Unfortunately, it's impossible to do

911
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,140
There are steps

912
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,140
If we don't destroy the fifth one

913
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Then, the fourth, fifth and the rest can't be destroyed

914
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,140
And that means

915
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,140
The Dark Lord is getting more and more evil

916
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,140
What do you all want?

917
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
If the Dark Lord wants to rule the world

918
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,140
What do you want?

919
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,140
So, I agree

920
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,140
If we don't destroy it, we'll sleep again

921
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,140
Do you really have no feelings?

922
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,140
Yes, I do

923
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,140
Yes, sir

924
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,140
Imagine

925
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,140
If Bargi can't live without the Ring Stone

926
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Can you imagine?

927
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,140
Don't you have feelings?

928
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,140
Enough, enough

929
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,140
Enough

But all decisions are in your hands

933
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,140
Think about it carefully

934
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,140
I won't force you

935
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,140
But, Professor

936
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:12,140
But, Alva

937
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,140
There's one thing you have to remember

938
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,140
If you want to keep the Ring Stone

939
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,140
Your life will never be peaceful

940
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:30,140
Because the danger that the Dark Lord brings

941
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,140
Not only for you

942
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,140

Come on, everyone

963
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,140
I think you're in there

964
01:01:49,140 --> 01:02:01,140
[We can do it]

965
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:10,140
Why is your house in the middle of the road?

Anggara

970
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,140
Where are you now?

971
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,140
Why haven't you returned to the castle?

Sir

973
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,140
You must remember

974
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,140
Where I am now, sir

975

You're in the gang

976
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,140
Who's Anggara?

977
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,140
How could this happen?

978
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,140
I was arrested

979
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,140
By Aldebaran

980
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,140
Sir

981
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,140
Aldebaran?

982
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,140
You're an idiot

983
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,140
Sir

984
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,140
Please listen to my explanation

985
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,140
Actually

986
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:05,140
I almost got the soul stone, sir

987
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,140
But

988
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,140
Mike, Jack, and Tommy

989
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,140
Betrayed me, sir

990
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,140
You're really an idiot, Anggara

991
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,140
You lost to a kid

992
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,140
I'm sorry, sir

993
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,140
I was careless, sir

994
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,140
But

995
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,140
I got valuable information, sir

996
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,140
It seems

997
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,140
Aldebaran and Mewa

998
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,140
Already know

999
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,140
Where the gang is, sir

1000
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,140
Are you sure?

1001
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,140
It seems so, sir

1002
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,140
Because I saw them whispering, sir

1003
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,140
Alright

1004
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:41,140
I'll investigate further

1005
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,140
Then

1006
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,140
Tommy, Mike, and Jack

1007
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,140
What now, sir?

1008
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,140
If they're really betraying me

1009
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,140
I'll investigate further

1010
01:03:51,140 --> 01:04:17,140
Who are you?

1011
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,140
I'm Pangen Redilang

1012
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,140
I want to tell you

1013
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:26,140
That I know where your gang is

1014
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,140
Don't lie

1015
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,140
I'm not lying

1016
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,140
If you really know

1017
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,140
Where is it?

1018
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,140
Aldebaran

1019
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:36,140
The leader of Sekolah Segeri

1020
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,140
Your gang is there

1021
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:45,140
You've come to Sekolah Segeri

1022
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,140
We've even explored

1023
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,140
The hideouts we suspected

1024
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,140
But

1025
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,140
We didn't find anything

1026
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,140
They've hidden it

1027
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,140
So you can't take this gang

1028
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,140
Alright

1029
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,140
Then

1030
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,140
We have to go back and look for it

1031
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,140
We have to unite our strength

1032
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,140
To defeat Aldebaran

1033
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,140
We agree

1034
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,140
We work together

1035
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,140

1039
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,140
I'm easier to defeat Aldebaran

We have to go

1042
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:30,140
The hideout must be found

1043
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:34,140
Wait

1044
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,140
What now?

1045
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,140
Search for it

1046
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:51,140

This is wrong, Purwa

This is not right

1064

You're an adult

I want to be with you forever

1074

But we can't be selfish

We can't be selfish

1076

As long as the 8th prince is still in power

1077
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,140
It's dangerous
