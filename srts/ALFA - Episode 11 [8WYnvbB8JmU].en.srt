5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Show your spirit, prepare it, my friend

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Run, jump, jump, we are the champions

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Be brave, don't give up

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, run with courage

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Prince?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 What should I do? My power is getting stronger

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I think this is an attack

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And, professor, what is this?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 This is one of the special powers of one of the students in this school

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 What about Alfa? What about Alfa?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Alfa has been in a coma twice

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I was bitten by Alfa

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Oh my, oh my, oh my, this is a mess, a mess

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Alfa must be in pain

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I have to help Alfa

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Hey, there's a dragon eating a stone mushroom and a papaya

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Guard, open the door for me

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Guard, open the door

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Open the door for me, quick

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I have a dragon that wants to come in

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Guard, open the door

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I'm suffocating, professor

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I'm freezing, I'm cold

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I'm freezing to death

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Just move, I can't, professor

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I have to take the firecracker

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 But, professor, the firecracker is in the highest tower in the school

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And I think I should move

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 There's no other way, only the firecracker can warm this room

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Armi, call Megantara and give her this firecracker

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Yes, professor

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Dafatang, give me the firecracker

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Megantara, come back quickly

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 The magic school is in trouble

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And I've already brought the firecracker back

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Because Dana is freezing

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Dafatang, explode

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I'm burning

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Find Megantara and bring her back

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Megantara, explode

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I'm so full

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I'm so hungry, I'm not feeling well

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I'm going to finish the firecracker

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Thank you for finishing your meal

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Now, it's time for you to drink the juice

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Yes, drink the juice

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Yes

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Yes

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Yes

 To be continued...

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Vega is like that for me

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 To be continued...

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 To be continued...

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 What's wrong, Alva?

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Alva?

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Oh no, it's terrible

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 My body is starting to get a rash

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 What should I do?

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Oh no, it's so weird

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Every time I send a letter, I have to punch it first

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 This is the back button of Professor Ardebar

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It means there's something very important at school

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 What should I do?

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Oh no, what should I do?

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Alva's business is not done yet

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 There's another problem

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Don't write my last sentence

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Just write it

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Delete it

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 She's not used to writing

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Okay, I'll be right back

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But wait until Alva's business is done

96
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Wow, that's so cool

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 If this is the way, I don't have to work as a teacher anymore

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You're just a lazy kid

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 That's why you have a lot of left overs

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Right

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Go back to Professor Abdi

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 What's wrong?

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I'm so tired

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I'm going to bed

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I'm so tired

106
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 This scratch is amazing

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 The cold feeling is gone

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Now you have to do another test

109
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Which is a board painting competition

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You have to do it manually

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Without magic, without magic

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 One child who finishes last

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Will be eliminated and can't continue to the next stage

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Please go straight to the paint house

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Painting is easy

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 That's my specialty

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 You two must be lame

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Do you know the idiom "Tongkosong Nyaring Bunyinya"

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 That's a noisy person but no brain

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Sorry, if a ghost fights a human

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It will definitely defeat the ghost

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Who said humans are more noble?

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 So, humans will always win

124
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Ghost

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Human

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Ghost

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Human

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 You have to paint the wall with your name

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Do it neatly and quickly

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 The child who finishes last and is the most messy

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Will be eliminated

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 We will start on the count of three

133
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 One

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Two

135
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Three

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Four

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Five

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Six

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Seven

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Eight

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Nine

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Ten

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Eleven

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Twelve

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Thirteen

146
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Fourteen

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Fifteen

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Sixteen

149
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Seventeen

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Eighteen

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Nineteen

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Seventeen

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Nineteen

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Eighteen

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Nineteen

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Seventeen

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Eighteen

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Nineteen

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Nineteen

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Eighteen

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Nineteen

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Eighteen

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Nineteen

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Eighteen

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Nineteen

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Nineteen

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Nineteen

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Nineteen

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Nineteen

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Nineteen

171
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Rega

172
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 You shouldn't be like this

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Because of me, you lost

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It's okay

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Our goal is to get that violin

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So, if one of us loses

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 What else can we do?

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 The important thing is you have to continue

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 You have to win, okay?

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Make sure my fight with Ray is not in vain

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Thank you, Rega

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I'm sorry, Rega

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 You have to go home now

184
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 You have to be able to

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Win

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 You failed too

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Rega?

188
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 What else can I do?

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He's a trap

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Afal is really angry

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I helped him

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And I lost too

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Rega, what should you do?

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Afal is weak

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Why did you let him win?

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I suggest you give that violin to Afal

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 What should I do?

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000

 You don't have to use that word

210
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It's better for him to fight for a friend

211

 And try hard

 Who will get the life fluid

219

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 The participants must be honest and fair

392
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 They can't cheat

393
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 What?

394
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 You've cheated by pushing Alva

395
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 So, you're the loser

396
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And we decided

397
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Alva will win this competition

398
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Yes!

399
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Thank you, jury!

400
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Thank you so much!

401
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I'm so happy!

402
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I'm so happy!

403
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I'm so happy!

404
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I'm so happy!

405
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Flita!

406
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Flita!

407
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Where are you?

408
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Flita!

409
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Flita!

410
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Flita!

411
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Flita!

412
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Flita!

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Flita!

414
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Let's just use my crystal ball

415
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Okay, you find it

416
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Okay

417
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Crystal ball's reception

418
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 The ball is in her hand

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 There she is!

420
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 What's wrong with my crystal ball?

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 I'm so sorry

422
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 We'll find out where Flita is soon

423
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 My little sister

424
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I'm going to cry

425
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Who are you?

426
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I'm Pangeran from a faraway country

427
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Why are you crying here?

428
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I'm a weirdo

429
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Everyone hates me

430
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I'm not a good person

431
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I'm not a good person

432
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 I'm not a good person

433
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I'm not a good person

434
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Then we're the same

435
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 What do you mean?

436
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I don't have any friends

437
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Almost everyone in this world hates me

438
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I'm considered a problem

439
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 What if we become friends?

440
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 But are you afraid of me?

441
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I have a strange power

442
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I can make everyone freeze

443
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Since we're friends

444
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 I'll tell you my secret

445
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 I also have a strange power

446
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I can't freeze

447
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Are you sure you want to be my friend?

448
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Give me your hand

449
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I'm not afraid of you

450
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'm not afraid of you

451
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 You see for yourself

452
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I don't freeze

453
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Professor Aldebaran

454
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 I got a message from Professor Agni

455
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 That the school is in danger

456
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 But who will do it?

457
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 We can do it

458
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 We can do it

459
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Who is it?

460
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Where's Alva?

461
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Ri, wake up!

462
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Ri, wake up!

463
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 It's morning

464
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 What about Alva?

465
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 I want to ask her

466
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Alva hasn't come

467
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Where's Alva?

468
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 She hasn't come

469
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 She hasn't come?

470
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 She hasn't come?

471
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I'm scared

472
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Alva?

473
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Alva?

474
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Are you okay?

475
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 You're okay, right?

476
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Alva?

477
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Are you okay?

478
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Alva?

479
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Alva?

480
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Alva?

481
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I'm scared

482
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 What's that?

483
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Watch out!

484
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Alva must have been possessed by a very evil magic

485
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 What kind of magic is this?

486
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 You're all dead

487
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 You're all dead

488
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Alva, you're safe!

489
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 You're safe!

490
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Come here

491
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Alva, I'm so relieved

492
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Alva, I'm so relieved

493
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 You're safe

494
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 You're safe

495
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 This is for you

496
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Thank you

497
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Thank you

498
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Cintara

499
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Cintara

500
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Forgive me

501
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 But thank you too, Cintara

502
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 But thank you too, Cintara

503
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Cintara

504
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Cintara

505
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Forgive me

506
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Forgive me

507
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Forgive me

508
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Help!

509
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Help!

510
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Help!

511
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Help!

512
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Help!

513
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 What's wrong, Cintara?

514
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 What's wrong?

515
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 I almost forgot

516
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 We have to go to school

517
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 We have to go to school

518
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Why?

519
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 This is a letter from Professor Ali Baran

520
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 I got a letter from him

521
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 He said our school is in danger

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 He said our school is in danger

523
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Danger? What danger?

524
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 So we have to go back to school

525
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 So we have to go back to school

526
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 This letter will make us

527
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 This letter will make us

528
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Make us able to go back to school

529
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Make us able to go back to school

530
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Come on

531
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Hold this

532
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Ready?

533
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Ready

534
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Ready

535
00:33:39,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Welcome, Alfa

536
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 I'm happy you're here

537
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Thank you, Professor

538
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Professor Ali Baran

539
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I got a letter from Professor Aki

540
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 He said our school is in danger

541
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 But who did this, Professor?

542
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 He did this

543
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 He did this

544
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 He did this

545
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 He did this?

546
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 But that's impossible

547
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 We didn't expect it either

548
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 We didn't expect it either

549
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 But it turns out

550
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Plita has special powers

551
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 But unfortunately

552
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 She can't control her powers

553
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 So when she's angry

554
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Angry, sad

555
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Feeling lonely, scared

556
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Then the power can come out

557
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Then the power can come out

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And what touches her can freeze

559
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And what touches her can freeze

560
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Where's Plita?

561
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 We haven't been able to find her

562
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 We need a telescope

563
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Ray, telescope

564
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Try using this telescope

565
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Where's Plita?

566
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 The food is so good

567
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 There's ice cream

568
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Permanent

569
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Bakso

570
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Ray, focus

571
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Find where's Plita

572
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 You're the one who's thinking about food

573
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 I'm hungry

574
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Plita

575
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Can you find Plita?

576
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 That's her

577
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 That's Plita

578
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Alva

579
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Plita

580
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 She's with a man

581
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 He's a criminal

582
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 But who is that, Prof?

583
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Or maybe

584
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Professor Angkara

585
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 But he looks different

586
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I brought you a warm chocolate

587
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Here, so your body will be warm

588
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,180
 He can see everything, how sweet you are, sadness is only a part of your heart.

589
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,500
 You only have deep heart, nothing else matters.

590
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,180
 You have got my heart, I've got your heart.

591
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,660
 And we'll always be together.

592
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:18,660
 You really think I can't go to you?

593
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,660
 I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your love.

594
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,660
 I'm afraid that you'll leave me.

595
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,660
 I'm scared.

596
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
 Wait!

597
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:37,660
 Who are you?

598
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,660
 To be continued...

599
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,660
 To be continued...

600
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,660
 To be continued...

601
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
 Bobo?

602
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:37,660
 Alva! Where are you?

603
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
 Alva!

604
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,660
 Alva! Where are you?

605
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,660
 Alva!

606
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,660
 That's Aldebar's voice.

607
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,660
 I can't face him with this power.

608
00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:04,660
 Alva!

609
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
 Alva?

610
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,660
 Alva, wake up.

611
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,660
 Alva, wake up.

612
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,660
 Alva?

613
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,660
 You're a handsome boy, why do you look like this?

614
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,660
 Alva, who did this to you?

615
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,660
 To be continued...

616
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:49,660
 How is it, Professor?

617
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,660
 It's nothing. We should go back inside.

618
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,660
 Come on, help Alva.

619
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:09,660
 Megantara's feeling says...

620
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,660
 ...that Professor Aldebaran is hiding something.

621
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
 To be continued...

622
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:31,660
 How long are we going to stay here?

623
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,660
 I'm getting sick of this.

624
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,660
 Be patient.

625
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,660
 Professor is trying to make us recover.

626
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,660
 We should just wait here.

627
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,660
 Because of the monster, we're like this.

628
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,660
 This school is so cold, we can't play.

629
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,660
 It's so cold, we should go back.

630
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,660
 Firecrackers.

631
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,660
 So this is how they do the cold.

632
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,660
 I know how to use this situation.

633
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:13,660
 To be continued...

634
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,660
 If the chair is gone, the fire will be destroyed.

635
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,660
 And Aldebaran can't use his magic because it's too cold.

636
00:41:43,660 --> 00:42:03,660
 A tree?

637
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:09,660
 To be continued...

638
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:28,660
 Where are you taking me?

639
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,660
 I'm taking you to a place that can heal your hand.

640
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,660
 I don't want to. I want to go down.

641
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,660
 Calm down. I'll stop.

642
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:47,660
 You can go down.

643
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,660
 To be continued...

644
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,660
 To be continued...

645
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,660
 To be continued...

646
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:10,660
 To be continued...

647
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,660
 To be continued...

648
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,660
 To be continued...

649
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:27,660
 To be continued...

650
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:34,660
 To be continued...

651
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:40,660
 To be continued...

652
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:49,660
 What are you doing?

653
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:58,660
 This is a very rare sight.

654
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
 He always attacks the tree.

655
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,660
 While his friends are at school.

656
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
 Yes, sir.

657
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,660
 I want to go to my own school.

658
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,660
 Throw him out of the school.

659
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,660
 Or just throw him out.

660
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,660
 I'm not wrong, sir.

661
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,660
 Don't throw me out of the school.

662
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,660
 Because I don't want to see you again.

663
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,660
 He's a bad guy.

664
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,660
 Don't go with him.

665
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,660
 He should be thrown out of this school.

666
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,660
 Throw him out.

667
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,660
 Let's go.

668
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
 Don't waste time with him.

669
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:42,660
 Let's go with him.

670
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,660
 Let's go.

671
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,660
 To be continued...

672
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,660
 To be continued...

673
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,660
 To be continued...

674
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,660
 To be continued...

675
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,660
 To be continued...

676
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,660
 To be continued...

677
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,660
 To be continued...

678
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,660
 To be continued...

679
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:36,660
 To be continued...

680
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,660
 To be continued...

681
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,660
 To be continued...

682
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,660
 To be continued...

683
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,660
 To be continued...

684
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:09,660
 Calm down, Elf.

685
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,660
 I don't mean any harm here.

686
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,660
 Why are you here?

687
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,660
 I want to tell you a secret.

688
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:37,660
 I have bad news and good news.

689
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
 What is it, sir?

690
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,660
 Alva.

691
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,660
 It seems that he has met the eighth prince.

692
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:50,660
 The good news is...

693
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
 Alva is safe.

694
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,660
 Although his face is a little wounded.

695
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
 The bad news is...

696
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,660
 The eighth prince has taken Plita away.

697
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:06,660
 Purwa.

698
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,660
 I want you to find Plita's whereabouts.

699
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,660
 As soon as you find her, let me know.

700
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,660
 Yes, sir.

701
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,660
 You all can go back to the clinic.

702
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,660
 And stay alert.

703
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,660
 I will call Alva.

704
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,660
 To train her to be stronger.

705
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,660
 Because one day...

706
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,660
 She may meet the eighth prince.

707
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,660
 Yes, sir.

708
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:41,660
 To be continued...

709
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,660
 To be continued...

710
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:59,660
 It's true what he said.

711
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,660
 To be continued...

712
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,660
 Professor is calling me.

713
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,660
 Alva.

714
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,660
 I mean to call you here.

715
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,660
 Because I want to teach you...

716
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,660
 The Pegasus Mantra.

717
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,660
 Pegasus Mantra?

718
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,660
 What is that, sir?

719
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,660
 Pegasus Mantra...

720
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,660
 Is a mantra that can create friends when you are alone.

721
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,660
 And you have to fight a strong enemy.

722
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,660
 Like before.

723
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,660
 I will set an example for you.

724
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,660
 Pegasus!

725
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,660
 So cool!

726
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:56,660
 Alva.

727
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,660
 Now, you go to me.

728
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,660
 Yes, sir.

729
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,660
 Look, Alva.

730
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,660
 My friend will protect me until the end.

731
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,660
 And I can pull myself away from the enemy.

732
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,660
 Or distract the enemy.

733
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:22,660
 Pegasus!

734
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,660
 Alva.

735
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,660
 What animal do you like the most?

736
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,660
 Garuda, sir.

737
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,660
 Very good.

738
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,660
 Now, you concentrate.

739
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,660
 And imagine Garuda's feather on your head.

740
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,660
 Then, say the Pegasus Mantra.

741
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,660
 Concentrate, Alva.

742
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,660
 Yes, sir.

743
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,660
 Pegasus!

744
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,660
 Why is it a chicken?

745
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,660
 Alva.

746
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,660
 Your enemy can't scare a chicken.

747
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,660
 Come on, try again.

748
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,660
 Pegasus!

749
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,660
 Wow, it's a duck.

750
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,660
 I will be laughed at by the enemy.

751
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,660
 Alva.

752
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,660
 That's all for today.

753
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,660
 Now, you should rest.

754
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,660
 We will continue tomorrow.

755
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,660
 Yes, sir.

756
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,660
 I will go now.

757
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,660
 I will go now.

758
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:35,660
 To be continued...

759
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:42,660
 To be continued...

760
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:59,660
 Alva.

761
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,660
 What are you doing there?

762
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,660
 I was taught a new mantra.

763
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,660
 A new mantra?

764
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,660
 Yes, so I can be stronger than the enemy.

765
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,660
 Who is the enemy you met?

766
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,660
 I asked the officer.

767
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,660
 He was so worried.

768
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,660
 I don't know.

769
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,660
 I talked to the officer.

770
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,660
 Don't tell anyone.

771
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,660
 The eighth god.

772
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,660
 The eighth god.

773
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,660
 The eighth god.

774
00:51:38,660 --> 00:52:04,660
 Who attacked you?

775
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,660

 Satria, Alva.

795
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,660
 What's wrong?

796
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:56,660
 It's been a long time, Professor Purwa.

797
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,660
 He hasn't told me anything yet.

798
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
 What's in the letter?

799
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:31,660
 We want to ask one of your teachers...

800
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:38,660
 to meet us in the snowy forest at the end of the forest.

801
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,660
 Who is he, Professor?

802
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,660
 I don't know.

803
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,660
 But I will go there.

804
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,660
 I will go with you.

810
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,660
 Wait.

811
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,660
 Be patient.

812
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,660
 We don't want to cause any trouble.

813
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,660
 Aldebaran.

814
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,660
 Is it true that you stole our firecrackers?

815
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,660
 You want to kiss my cheek?

816
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,660
 You're too much.

817
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,660
 Don't dream.

818
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,660
 Professor Aldebaran is not a thief.

819
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,660
 Don't lie.

820
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,660
 The last person who brought the firecrackers...

821
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,660
 was our brother, Pancas.

822
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,660
 Yes.

823
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,660
 Pancas is my twin brother.

824
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,660
 And we heard the news...

825
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,660
 that Pancas has passed away.

826
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,660
 Popo is missing.

827
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,660
 And until now...

828
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,660
 we haven't found the firecrackers that Pancas had.

829
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,660
 And someone told us...

830
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,660
 that the firecrackers are now at the civil school.

831
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,660
 And our assistant, Popo...

832
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,660
 has been made a spy.

833
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,660
 Calm down.

834
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,660
 Be patient.

835
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,660
 I will tell you what really happened.

836
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,660
 A few years ago...

837
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,660
 I met Pancas.

838
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,660
 At that time...

839
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,660
 Pancas was fighting the 8th Prince.

840
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,660
 At that time...

841
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,660
 I saw that Pancas was exhausted...

842
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,660
 and almost lost.

843
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,660
 And when I tried to help him...

844
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,660
 his wound was too bad.

845
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,660
 I couldn't save him.
