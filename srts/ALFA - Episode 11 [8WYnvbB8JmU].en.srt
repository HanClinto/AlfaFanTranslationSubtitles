1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Show your spirit, prepare it, my friend

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Run, jump, jump, we are the champions

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, run with courage

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Prince?

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What should I do? My power is getting stronger

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think this is an attack

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And, professor, what is this?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is one of the special powers of one of the students in this school

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What about Alfa? What about Alfa?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alfa has been in a coma twice

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was bitten by Alfa

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh my, oh my, oh my, this is a mess, a mess

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alfa must be in pain

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have to help Alfa

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey, there's a dragon eating a stone mushroom and a papaya

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Guard, open the door for me

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Guard, open the door

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Open the door for me, quick

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have a dragon that wants to come in

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Guard, open the door

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm suffocating, professor

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm freezing, I'm cold

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm freezing to death

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Just move, I can't, professor

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have to take the firecracker

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But, professor, the firecracker is in the highest tower in the school

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And I think I should move

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's no other way, only the firecracker can warm this room

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Armi, call Megantara and give her this firecracker

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, professor

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Dafatang, give me the firecracker

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Megantara, come back quickly

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The magic school is in trouble

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I've already brought the firecracker back

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because Dana is freezing

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Dafatang, explode

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm burning

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Find Megantara and bring her back

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Megantara, explode

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm so full

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm so hungry, I'm not feeling well

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to finish the firecracker

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you for finishing your meal

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Now, it's time for you to drink the juice

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, drink the juice

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Vega is like that for me

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong, Alfa?

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Alfa?

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh no, it's terrible

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
My body is starting to get a rash

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What should I do?

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh no, it's so weird

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Every time I send a letter, I have to punch it first

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This is the back button of Professor Ardebar

63
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It means there's something very important at school

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What should I do?

65
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh no, what should I do?

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Alfa's business is not done yet

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's another problem

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't write my last sentence

69
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Just write it

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Delete it

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She's not used to writing

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, I'll be right back

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But wait until Alfa's business is done

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Wow, that's so cool

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If this is the way, I don't have to work as a teacher anymore

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're just a lazy kid

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's why you have a lot of left overs

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right

79
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Go back to Professor Abdi

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What's wrong?

81
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm so tired

82
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm going to bed

83
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm so tired

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This scratch is amazing

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The cold feeling is gone

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now you have to do another test

87
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Which is a board painting competition

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You have to do it manually

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Without magic, without magic

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
One child who finishes last

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Will be eliminated and can't continue to the next stage

92
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please go straight to the paint house

93
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Painting is easy

94
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's my specialty

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You two must be lame

96
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Do you know the idiom "Tongkosong Nyaring Bunyinya"

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's a noisy person but no brain

98
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Sorry, if a ghost fights a human

99
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It will definitely defeat the ghost

100
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Who said humans are more noble?

101
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, humans will always win

102
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Ghost

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Human

104
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ghost

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Human

106
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You have to paint the wall with your name

107
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Do it neatly and quickly

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The child who finishes last and is the most messy

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Will be eliminated

110
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We will start on the count of three

111
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
One

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Two

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Three

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Four

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Five

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Six

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Seven

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Eight

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Nine

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ten

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Eleven

122
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Twelve

123
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thirteen

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Fourteen

125
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Fifteen

126
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sixteen

127
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Seventeen

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Eighteen

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Nineteen

130
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Seventeen

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Nineteen

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Eighteen

133
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Nineteen

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Seventeen

135
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Eighteen

136
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Nineteen

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Eighteen

138
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Nineteen

139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Eighteen

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Nineteen

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Eighteen

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Nineteen

143
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Rega

144
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You shouldn't be like this

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because of me, you lost

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's okay

147
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Our goal is to get that violin

148
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, if one of us loses

149
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What else can we do?

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The important thing is you have to continue

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have to win, okay?

152
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Make sure my fight with Ray is not in vain

153
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thank you, Rega

154
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry, Rega

155
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You have to go home now

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You have to be able to

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Win

158
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You failed too

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Rega?

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What else can I do?

161
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He's a trap

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Afal is really angry

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I helped him

164
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I lost too

165
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Rega, what should you do?

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Afal is weak

167
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why did you let him win?

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I suggest you give that violin to Afal

169
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What should I do?

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I forgot

171
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I didn't think of that

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I just want to try to win

173
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
A forester eats a pondo's nest

174
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's not that he's stupid

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He's just nice

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Whatever the reason

177
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Fighting and sacrificing for a friend

178
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Won't bring you any results

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But, soldier

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But, soldier?

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You don't have to use that word

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's better for him to fight for a friend

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And try hard

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Than you

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Failed because you don't want to eat vegetables

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Vegetable chicken

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Huh?

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is the final round

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The final round will decide

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Who will get the life fluid

191
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You have to run until the finish line

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Whoever arrives first is the winner

193
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Remember

194
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I have a strange power

391
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I can make everyone freeze

392
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Since we're friends

393
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll tell you my secret

394
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I also have a strange power

395
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I can't freeze

396
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Are you sure you want to be my friend?

397
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Give me your hand

398
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm not afraid of you

399
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You see for yourself

400
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't freeze

401
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Professor Aldebaran

402
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I got a message from Professor Agni

403
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That the school is in danger

404
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But who will do it?

405
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We can do it

406
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Who is it?

407
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Where's Alfa?

408
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Ri, wake up!

409
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's morning

410
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What about Alfa?

411
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I want to ask her

412
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Alfa hasn't come

413
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Where's Alfa?

414
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
She hasn't come

415
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
She hasn't come?

416
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm scared

417
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Alfa?

418
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Are you okay?

419
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You're okay, right?

420
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Alfa?

421
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Are you okay?

422
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Alfa?

423
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm scared

424
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What's that?

425
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Watch out!

426
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Alfa must have been possessed by a very evil magic

427
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What kind of magic is this?

428
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You're all dead

429
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Alfa, you're safe!

430
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You're safe!

431
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Come here

432
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Alfa, I'm so relieved

433
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You're safe

434
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This is for you

435
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Thank you

436
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Cintara

437
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Forgive me

438
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But thank you too, Cintara

439
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Cintara

440
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Forgive me

441
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Help!

442
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What's wrong, Cintara?

443
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What's wrong?

444
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I almost forgot

445
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We have to go to school

446
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why?

447
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This is a letter from Professor Ali Baran

448
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I got a letter from him

449
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
He said our school is in danger

450
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Danger? What danger?

451
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So we have to go back to school

452
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
This letter will make us

453
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Make us able to go back to school

454
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Come on

455
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Hold this

456
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Ready?

457
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Ready

458
00:33:39,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Welcome, Alfa

459
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm happy you're here

460
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Thank you, Professor

461
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Professor Ali Baran

462
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I got a letter from Professor Aki

463
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
He said our school is in danger

464
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But who did this, Professor?

465
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
He did this

466
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
He did this?

467
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But that's impossible

468
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
We didn't expect it either

469
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But it turns out

470
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Plita has special powers

471
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But unfortunately

472
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
She can't control her powers

473
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So when she's angry

474
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Angry, sad

475
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Feeling lonely, scared

476
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Then the power can come out

477
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And what touches her can freeze

478
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Where's Plita?

479
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We haven't been able to find her

480
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
We need a telescope

481
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Ray, telescope

482
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Try using this telescope

483
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Where's Plita?

484
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The food is so good

485
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There's ice cream

486
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Permanent

487
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Bakso

488
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Ray, focus

489
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Find where's Plita

490
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You're the one who's thinking about food

491
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm hungry

492
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Plita

493
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Can you find Plita?

494
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's her

495
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's Plita

496
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Alfa

497
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Plita

498
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:07,000
She's with a man

499
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
He's a criminal

500
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But who is that, Prof?

501
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Or maybe

502
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Professor Angkara

503
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But he looks different

504
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I brought you a warm chocolate

505
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Here, so your body will be warm

506
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,180
He can see everything, how sweet you are, sadness is only a part of your heart.

507
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,500
You only have deep heart, nothing else matters.

508
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,180
You have got my heart, I've got your heart.

509
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,660
And we'll always be together.

510
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:18,660
You really think I can't go to you?

511
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,660
I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your love.

512
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,660
I'm afraid that you'll leave me.

513
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,660
I'm scared.

514
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
Wait!

515
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:37,660
Who are you?

516
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
Bobo?

517
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:37,660
Alfa! Where are you?

518
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Alfa!

519
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,660
Alfa! Where are you?

520
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,660
Alfa!

521
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,660
That's Aldebar's voice.

522
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,660
I can't face him with this power.

523
00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:04,660
Alfa!

524
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Alfa?

525
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,660
Alfa, wake up.

526
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,660
Alfa?

527
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,660
You're a handsome boy, why do you look like this?

528
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,660
Alfa, who did this to you?

529
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:49,660
How is it, Professor?

530
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,660
It's nothing. We should go back inside.

531
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Come on, help Alfa.

532
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Megantara's feeling says...

533
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,660
...that Professor Aldebaran is hiding something.

534
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:31,660
How long are we going to stay here?

535
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,660
I'm getting sick of this.

536
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,660
Be patient.

537
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,660
Professor is trying to make us recover.

538
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,660
We should just wait here.

539
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,660
Because of the monster, we're like this.

540
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,660
This school is so cold, we can't play.

541
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,660
It's so cold, we should go back.

542
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Firecrackers.

543
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,660
So this is how they do the cold.

544
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,660
I know how to use this situation.

545
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,660
If the chair is gone, the fire will be destroyed.

546
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,660
And Aldebaran can't use his magic because it's too cold.

547
00:41:43,660 --> 00:42:03,660
A tree?

548
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:28,660
Where are you taking me?

549
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,660
I'm taking you to a place that can heal your hand.

550
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,660
I don't want to. I want to go down.

551
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,660
Calm down. I'll stop.

552
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:47,660
You can go down.

553
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:49,660
What are you doing?

554
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:58,660
This is a very rare sight.

555
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
He always attacks the tree.

556
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,660
While his friends are at school.

557
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
Yes, sir.

558
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,660
I want to go to my own school.

559
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,660
Throw him out of the school.

560
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,660
Or just throw him out.

561
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,660
I'm not wrong, sir.

562
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,660
Don't throw me out of the school.

563
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,660
Because I don't want to see you again.

564
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,660
He's a bad guy.

565
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,660
Don't go with him.

566
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,660
He should be thrown out of this school.

567
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,660
Throw him out.

568
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,660
Let's go.

569
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
Don't waste time with him.

570
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Let's go with him.

571
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,660
Let's go.

572
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:09,660
Calm down, Elf.

573
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,660
I don't mean any harm here.

574
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,660
Why are you here?

575
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,660
I want to tell you a secret.

576
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:37,660
I have bad news and good news.

577
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
What is it, sir?

578
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,660
Alfa.

579
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,660
It seems that he has met the eighth prince.

580
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:50,660
The good news is...

581
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
Alfa is safe.

582
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,660
Although his face is a little wounded.

583
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
The bad news is...

584
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,660
The eighth prince has taken Plita away.

585
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:06,660
Purwa.

586
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,660
I want you to find Plita's whereabouts.

587
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,660
As soon as you find her, let me know.

588
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,660
Yes, sir.

589
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,660
You all can go back to the clinic.

590
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,660
And stay alert.

591
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,660
I will call Alfa.

592
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,660
To train her to be stronger.

593
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,660
Because one day...

594
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,660
She may meet the eighth prince.

595
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,660
Yes, sir.

596
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:59,660
It's true what he said.

597
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,660
Professor is calling me.

598
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,660
Alfa.

599
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,660
I mean to call you here.

600
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,660
Because I want to teach you...

601
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,660
The Pegasus Mantra.

602
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,660
Pegasus Mantra?

603
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,660
What is that, sir?

604
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,660
Pegasus Mantra...

605
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,660
Is a mantra that can create friends when you are alone.

606
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,660
And you have to fight a strong enemy.

607
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,660
Like before.

608
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,660
I will set an example for you.

609
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,660
Pegasus!

610
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,660
So cool!

611
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:56,660
Alfa.

612
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,660
Now, you go to me.

613
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,660
Yes, sir.

614
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,660
Look, Alfa.

615
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,660
My friend will protect me until the end.

616
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,660
And I can pull myself away from the enemy.

617
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,660
Or distract the enemy.

618
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:22,660
Pegasus!

619
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,660
Alfa.

620
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,660
What animal do you like the most?

621
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,660
Garuda, sir.

622
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,660
Very good.

623
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,660
Now, you concentrate.

624
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,660
And imagine Garuda's feather on your head.

625
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,660
Then, say the Pegasus Mantra.

626
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,660
Concentrate, Alfa.

627
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,660
Yes, sir.

628
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,660
Pegasus!

629
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,660
Why is it a chicken?

630
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,660
Alfa.

631
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,660
Your enemy can't scare a chicken.

632
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,660
Come on, try again.

633
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,660
Pegasus!

634
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,660
Wow, it's a duck.

635
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,660
I will be laughed at by the enemy.

636
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,660
Alfa.

637
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,660
That's all for today.

638
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,660
Now, you should rest.

639
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,660
We will continue tomorrow.

640
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,660
Yes, sir.

641
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,660
I will go now.

642
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:59,660
Alfa.

643
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,660
What are you doing there?

644
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,660
I was taught a new mantra.

645
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,660
A new mantra?

646
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,660
Yes, so I can be stronger than the enemy.

647
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,660
Who is the enemy you met?

648
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,660
I asked the officer.

649
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,660
He was so worried.

650
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,660
I don't know.

651
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,660
I talked to the officer.

652
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,660
Don't tell anyone.

653
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:38,660
The eighth god.

654
00:51:38,660 --> 00:52:04,660
Who attacked you?

655
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Tell me.

656
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:48,660
Satria, Alfa.

657
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,660
What's wrong?

658
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:56,660
It's been a long time, Professor Purwa.

659
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,660
He hasn't told me anything yet.

660
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
What's in the letter?

661
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:31,660
We want to ask one of your teachers...

662
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:38,660
to meet us in the snowy forest at the end of the forest.

663
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,660
Who is he, Professor?

664
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,660
I don't know.

665
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,660
But I will go there.

666
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,660
I will go with you.

667
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:17,660
Satria, Alfa.

668
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,660
Wait.

669
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,660
Be patient.

670
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,660
We don't want to cause any trouble.

671
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,660
Aldebaran.

672
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,660
Is it true that you stole our firecrackers?

673
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,660
You want to kiss my cheek?

674
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,660
You're too much.

675
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,660
Don't dream.

676
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,660
Professor Aldebaran is not a thief.

677
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,660
Don't lie.

678
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,660
The last person who brought the firecrackers...

679
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,660
was our brother, Pancas.

680
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,660
Yes.

681
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,660
Pancas is my twin brother.

682
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,660
And we heard the news...

683
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,660
that Pancas has passed away.

684
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,660
Popo is missing.

685
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,660
And until now...

686
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,660
we haven't found the firecrackers that Pancas had.

687
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,660
And someone told us...

688
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,660
that the firecrackers are now at the civil school.

689
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,660
And our assistant, Popo...

690
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,660
has been made a spy.

691
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,660
Calm down.

692
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,660
Be patient.

693
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,660
I will tell you what really happened.

694
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,660
A few years ago...

695
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,660
I met Pancas.

696
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,660
At that time...

697
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,660
Pancas was fighting the 8th Prince.

698
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,660
At that time...

699
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,660
I saw that Pancas was exhausted...

700
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,660
and almost lost.

701
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,660
And when I tried to help him...

702
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,660
his wound was too bad.

703
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,660
I couldn't save him.

704
00:57:04,660 --> 01:00:30,660
[Pancas was attacked by the 8th Prince]

705
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,660
Altebaran, we give you time until tomorrow morning.

706
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,660
If our Kris doesn't come back,

707
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,660
and our servant Pomo is no longer normal,

708
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,660
we will attack the school of magic.

709
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,660
And your teacher...

710
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:47,660
Your teacher will not come back.

711
01:00:48,660 --> 01:03:02,660
[Pancas was attacked by the 8th Prince]
