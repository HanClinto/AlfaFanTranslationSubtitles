Keep an eye on the raptor

Why do you want to be chased again?

91

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Ouch!

387
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What's wrong?

388
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sorry

389
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You attacked me again

390
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You want to kill me?

391
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm almost dead

392
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm not going to die

393
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't be mad

394
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Calm down

395
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You're safe

396
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Let's go

397
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Alfa is here

398
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
She's in the village clinic

399
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I want to see her

400
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Stop fighting

401
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's go find Alfa

402
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Let's go

403
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It hurts

404
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm sure

405
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is all my doing

406
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I have a monster

407
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yes, I did it

408
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You don't have any feelings

409
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Let's fix this at my house

410
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I want to see her

411
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Don't go there

412
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You don't have any feelings

413
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You guys

414
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Why are you here?

415
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
We're looking for you

416
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Let's go home

417
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Let's go

418
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
We can go back to school with this

419
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
What's wrong?

420
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I still have something to do

421
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
What is it?

422
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I have something to do

423
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Like a police officer

424
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You know?

425
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I want to make my house like yours

426
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Like yours?

427
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Why are you going there?

428
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The house is scary

429
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And scary people

430
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Are you from there?

431
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yes, we fixed this telescope

432
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
That was broken

433
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What are you doing?

434
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
She's a ghost

435
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm curious who she is

436
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Here, take this

437
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay

438
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
What is that?

439
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It looks like a monster

440
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Why is it not here yet?

441
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'll try here

442
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Here, try this

443
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's broken

444
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Try again

445
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's broken

446
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Let's fix this at the police station

447
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Okay, let's fix this at my house

448
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't want to

449
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Don't go there

450
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Don't

451
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I don't want to

452
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm scared

453
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I know

454
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But

455
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm not afraid of the ghost

456
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
They always ask for help

457
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I think they are attacked

458
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
By the monster

459
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I feel sorry for them

460
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I want to take care of their house

461
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Do you want to come?

462
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
If you don't want to come

463
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's okay, I'll go by myself

464
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Me too

465
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You want to come too, right?

466
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
We are friends

467
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Okay

468
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
1, 2, 3

469
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Time to

470
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Wash our hands

471
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Why are you so slow?

472
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Why don't you give up?

473
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Why are they there?

474
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm going to succeed

475
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What's wrong?

476
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Sir

477
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm so sorry

478
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I could have made you

479
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Appear in front of the people

480
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
If I had been

481
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Appear in front of the people

482
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
They would have been fired

483
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You are stupid

484
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Why did you act

485
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Not according to what I ordered

486
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But sir

487
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Shut up

488
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't want all my plans to fail

489
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We wait until the full moon

490
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Because at that time

491
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's the right time for us to act

492
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Tonight is the night of the full moon

493
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm sorry

494
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I have to hide

495
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I can't go out

496
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Because I don't want to hurt anyone

497
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Anyone

498
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm sorry

499
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Excuse me

500
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Who is this?

501
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:47,000
What are you doing here?

502
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Sir

503
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
The telescope is broken

504
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Can you fix it?

505
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Here

506
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
This is what makes me angry

507
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Wait

508
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Where are you going?

509
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There

510
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Why is it broken?

511
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's not

512
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's easy to get in

513
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I can't

514
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Go upstairs

515
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Why is the password?

516
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
TETOT

517
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You're wrong

518
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Remember, if you're wrong three times, you'll be blocked

519
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I can't be with you, Mumi

520
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Panji

521
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
TETOT

522
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You're wrong again

523
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm wrong again

524
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What's the password?

525
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Last chance

526
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
15 seconds left

527
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I just saw you here

528
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What's your name?

529
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
If you're wrong, you'll be blocked

530
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
My name is Alfa

531
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Why is it open?

532
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You said the password is correct

533
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Please come in

534
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So, the password is Alfa

535
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What's wrong?

536
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That's it

537
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
This can't be fixed

538
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's broken

539
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Here

540
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
When you get home, I still have a lot of things to do

541
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It hurts

542
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm tired

543
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Can I rest here for a while?

544
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
My feet hurt

545
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I can't

546
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I can't eat plastic

547
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's promise not to eat plastic

548
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It hurts

549
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I'm sorry

550
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Mum

551
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Dad

552
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Mum, wake up

553
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Dad wake up!

554
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Mom, wake up!

555
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Wake up dad!

556
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Mom!

557
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Wake up!

559
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
How can he breathe?

560
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That means they're still alive!

561
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Dad wake up!

562
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Mom, wake up!

Dad!

566
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That means they're just a residual.

567
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
[crying]

568
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Dad, wake up!

569
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We're trapped.

570
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Dad is being punished.

571
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You have to let him go.

572
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Dad!

Dad!

576
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Mom!

I'm going to laugh.

00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Let's hide.

We have to help him.

You can't free them this way.

604
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But you killed them.

605
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
They can't get out of this chain.

606
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I just want to free my parents.

607
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Go.

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Go away.

You're a criminal.

You should know.

611
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'll kill you when you leave.

612
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
No.

613
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Who are you?

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000

Mr. Anji.

Don't.

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
He ran away.

696
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
What?

697
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Let's go back to school.

698
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We'll tell the teacher about this.

699
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yes, we'll go there again.

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
No.

701
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I don't want to go there.

702
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And then, I don't want to lose my parents.

703
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Where is the telescope?

704
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Here.

705
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But, the telescope is broken.

706
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The cable can't be used.

707
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It's totally broken.

708
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So, it can't be fixed.

709
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Maybe there is a clue.

710
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Let's try.

711
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Where?

712
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Mount Surab.

713
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Huh?

714
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Why is there a sound?

715
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't know.

716
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Maybe he didn't show us.

717
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Maybe he tried to show us.

718
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's impossible.

719
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That's a mistake.

720
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The telescope is broken.

721
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's not his fault.

722
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You know where Mount Surab is.

723
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yes.

724
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm so scared.

725
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm scared.

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
No.

00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm not scared.

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm brave.

729
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'll find my father.

730
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Please, help me.

731
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Please, take care of my parents.

732
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'll be back.

733
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Don't.

734
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The monster is coming.

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It hurts.

Be happy.

738
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Don't be sad.

739
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
If you're scared, just stay.

740
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I'm scared.

741
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Where is he?

742
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm scared.

743
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Oh, yeah.

744
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
What's going on?

745
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's from the ground.

746
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Kill them all.

747
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Don't let them escape.

748
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes, sir.

749
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
We can do this.

Next episode...

751
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Change the target.

752
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Then, attack them all.

753
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Yes, sir.

754
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Kill them all.

00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Help me.

I have to find him.

760
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I have to get the money.

761
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Because...

762
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I have to save them.

763
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:39,000
There's a monster.

764
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Why is it attacking us?

765
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Professor, it's angry.

766
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I've defeated you.

767
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What?

768
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
The child is still alive?

769
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Akara.

770
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Finish the child and the monster.

771
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Hurry.

772
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Why hasn't he come yet?

773
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Don't let him get to me again.

774
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Don't be rude.

775
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Okay.

776
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's better if you don't come back.

777
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Let's follow the monster.

778
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm hungry.

779
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Where should we go?

780
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Don't be mistaken.

781
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
The inside is...

782
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Forgive me.

783
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Akara, don't be rude.

784
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Don't be rude.

785
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm angry.

786
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Don't be rude.

787
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Where's the makeup?

788
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Hurry up.

789
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Okay.

790
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Fire!

791
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It's okay.

792
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Now is the time.

793
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Now I can save Mr. Panji.

794
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Where are you, Alfa?

795
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Are you scared?

796
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Poor you.

797
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I see.

798
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Because your power is not as good as mine.

799
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Where are you, Alfa?

800
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Who's scared?

801
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You're back.

802
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But I have to finish you first, Panji.

803
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
She's gone.

804
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You're confused, right?

805
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I'm not angry.

806
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
This must be Alfa's trick.

807
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Alfa, come out!

808
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:26,000
What's wrong with him?

809
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Akara!

810
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
How dare you attack me?

811
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I'm sorry, sir.

812
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Alfa and Srika are dead.

813
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
But you've ruined them.

814
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Answer me!

815
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Don't be angry, sir.

816
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You'll be in trouble.

817
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Shut up!

818
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
You're Akara, right?

819
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yes.

820
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yes, I'm Akara.

821
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Answer me!

822
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I was told to shut up.

823
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Alfa, come out!

824
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
You scared me.

825
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:35,000
We can do this.

826
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:45,000
What is it, Professor?

827
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I'm thinking about the eighth wave.

828
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Before it ruins the world...

829
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
...we have to fight it.

830
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
But how, Professor?

831
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
We know that...

832
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
...the eighth wave has recovered.

833
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It's even stronger now.

834
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
The only way...

835
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
...is to find the soul stone.

836
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Find the soul stone.

837
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Okay.

838
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Professor.

839
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Let me go find it.

840
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Don't, Megatara.

841
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
This mission is too dangerous.

842
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I don't want to involve the children.

843
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
We don't have to involve the children.

844
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's better if...

845
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
...me and the other professors...

846
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
...go and complete this mission.

847
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
That's the problem, Megatara.

848
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
We have to involve the children.

849
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Because the soul stone is filled by the eighth wave.

850
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It can only be seen by the children.

851
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
"The eighth wave has recovered. The children are safe."

852
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Where are you going?

853
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Don't touch me!

854
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Let's go.

855
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I'm going to get the soul stone.

856
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:49,000
That's me.

857
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Don't touch me.

858
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Let go of me!

859
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I don't want to.

860
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'll kill you.

861
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
You're a group again.

862
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I love you.

863
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You're a group again.

864
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Let's go.

865
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Wait.

866
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
What are you doing?

867
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Who are you?

868
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
You're still alive.

869
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I know you're using the eighth wave.

870
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Alfa, where are you?

871
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Alfa!

872
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Alfa, come out!

873
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You scared me.

874
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I'm going to look for my father.

875
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I'm going home with my doll.

876
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's not a doll.

877
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That's a lizard.

878
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Alfa, why did you bring the lizard here?

879
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Where did it come from?

880
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I saw a raptor attacking the lizard.

881
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
A raptor?

882
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Yes, a raptor is a creature from the Angkara province.

883
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It attacked the lizard and fainted.

884
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
If the lizard lost, why did you bring it here?

885
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Are you going to cure it?

886
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
No, it's not a raptor.

887
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Then?

888
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It's my father.

889
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
My father?

890
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yes, my father is a raptor.

891
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:39,000
The raptor is so cute.

892
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Don't come near me.

893
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I'll give you a name.

894
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It's Blacky.

895
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Blacky?

896
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Why is it called Blacky?

897
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Come here.

898
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Let's go.

899
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Wake up.

900
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Let's play.

901
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
(Blacky's roar)

902
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

903
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I promise I'll be a better man.

904
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Sir.

905
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Okay.

906
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I'll give you another chance.

907
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
But don't fail.

908
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
We don't have much time.

909
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
We only have six hours before the sun sets.

910
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And I don't want the lizard to turn into a rat.

911
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Do you understand?

912
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Okay, sir.

913
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I'll try.

914
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
(Blacky's roar)

915
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:12,000
What do you want?

916
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I want you to come to my house.

917
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Don't you dare to attack the kid.

918
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
They are evil.

919
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
No.

920
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
That's a lie.

921
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
They are evil.

922
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Dad.

923
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Mom.

924
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Dad.

925
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Mom.

926
01:08:48,000 --> 01:09:41,000
(Blacky's roar)
