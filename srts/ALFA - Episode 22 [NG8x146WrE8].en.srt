 Very good

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Keep an eye on the raptor

 If you're wrong, you'll be blocked

 My name is Alfa

618
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 Why is it open?

619
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 You said the password is correct

 When will it be over?

780
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 We're attacked.

781
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 Alva, you should let your parents go now.

782
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 Don't touch me.

783
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 [music]

784
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 What if Alva asks?

785
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 They fainted.

786
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 They can't breathe.

787
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 [music]

788
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 Let's look for Mr. Anji.

789
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 There is the way.

790
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 Yes.

791
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 And Mr. Anji is there.

792
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 [music]

793
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 Mr. Anji.

794
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 Mr. Anji.

795
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 Mr. Anji.

796
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 Mr. Anji.

797
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 Where is he?

798
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 Mr. Anji.

799
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Mr. Anji.

800
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 Mr. Anji.

801
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 Mr. Anji.

802
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 Mr. Anji.

803
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 Mr. Anji.

804
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 He's not here.

805
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 He's not here.

806
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 Mr. Anji.

807
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 Mr. Anji.

808
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 Mr. Anji.

809
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Where is Mr. Anji?

810
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 Don't.

811
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 He ran away.

812
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 What?

813
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Let's go back to school.

814
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 We'll tell the teacher about this.

815
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 Yes, we'll go there again.

816
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 No.

817
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 I don't want to go there.

818
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 And then, I don't want to lose my parents.

819
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 Where is the telescope?

820
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 Where is the telescope?

821
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Here.

822
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 But, the telescope is broken.

823
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 The cable can't be used.

824
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 It's totally broken.

825
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 So, it can't be fixed.

826
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 Maybe there is a clue.

827
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 Let's try.

828
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Where?

829
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 Mount Surab.

830
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 Huh?

831
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 Why is there a sound?

832
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 I don't know.

833
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 Maybe he didn't show us.

834
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 Maybe he tried to show us.

835
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 That's impossible.

836
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 That's a mistake.

837
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 The telescope is broken.

838
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 It's not his fault.

839
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 You know where Mount Surab is.

840
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 Yes.

841
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 I'm so scared.

842
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 I'm scared.

843
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 No.

844
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 I'm not scared.

845
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 I'm brave.

846
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 I'll find my father.

847
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 Please, help me.

848
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 Please, take care of my parents.

849
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 I'll be back.

850
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 Don't.

851
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 Don't.

852
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 The monster is coming.

853
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 Tole.

854
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 It hurts.

855
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 Be happy.

856
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 Don't be sad.

857
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 If you're scared, just stay.

858
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 I'm scared.

859
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 Where is he?

860
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 I'm scared.

861
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 Oh, yeah.

862
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 What's going on?

863
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 It's from the ground.

864
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 Kill them all.

865
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 Don't let them escape.

866
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 Yes, sir.

867
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 We can do this.

868
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 To be continued...

869
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 Next episode...

870
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 Change the target.

871
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 Then, attack them all.

872
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 Yes, sir.

873
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 Kill them all.

874
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 Don't let them escape.

875
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 Yes, sir.

876
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 Hurry.

877
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 To be continued...

878
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 To be continued...

879
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 To be continued...

880
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 To be continued...

881
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 To be continued...

882
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 To be continued...

883
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 To be continued...

884
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 To be continued...

885
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 Help me.

886
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 I have to find him.

887
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 I have to get the money.

888
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 Because...

889
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 I have to save them.

890
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 There's a monster.

891
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 Why is it attacking us?

892
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 Professor, it's angry.

893
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 I've defeated you.

894
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 I've defeated you.

895
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 I've defeated you.

896
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
 To be continued...

897
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 To be continued...

898
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 To be continued...

899
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 To be continued...

900
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 What?

901
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 The child is still alive?

902
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 Akara.

903
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 Finish the child and the monster.

904
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
 Hurry.

905
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 To be continued...

906
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 Why hasn't he come yet?

907
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 Don't let him get to me again.

908
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 Don't be rude.

909
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 Okay.

910
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 It's better if you don't come back.

911
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 Let's follow the monster.

912
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 I'm hungry.

913
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 I'm hungry.

914
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 Where should we go?

915
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 Don't be mistaken.

916
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 The inside is...

917
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 The inside is...

918
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 Forgive me.

919
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 Forgive me.

920
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 Akara, don't be rude.

921
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Don't be rude.

922
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 Don't be rude.

923
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 Don't be rude.

924
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 I'm angry.

925
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Don't be rude.

926
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 Where's the makeup?

927
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 Hurry up.

928
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 Okay.

929
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
 Fire!

930
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 It's okay.

931
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 Now is the time.

932
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
 Now I can save Mr. Panji.

933
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 Where are you, Alva?

934
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 Are you scared?

935
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 Poor you.

936
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
 I see.

937
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 Because your power is not as good as mine.

938
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 Where are you, Alva?

939
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 Who's scared?

940
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 You're back.

941
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 But I have to finish you first, Panji.

942
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
 She's gone.

943
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 You're confused, right?

944
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 I'm not angry.

945
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
 This must be Alva's trick.

946
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 Alva, come out!

947
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 Alva, come out!

948
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 Alva, come out!

949
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 Alva, come out!

950
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:26,000
 What's wrong with him?

951
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 Akara!

952
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 How dare you attack me?

953
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 I'm sorry, sir.

954
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 Alva and Srika are dead.

955
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
 But you've ruined them.

956
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
 Answer me!

957
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
 Don't be angry, sir.

958
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
 You'll be in trouble.

959
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
 Shut up!

960
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 You're Akara, right?

961
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 Yes.

962
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
 Yes, I'm Akara.

963
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
 Answer me!

964
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 I was told to shut up.

965
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 Alva, come out!

966
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 You scared me.

967
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 We can do this.

968
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 We can do this.

969
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 What is it, Professor?

970
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
 I'm thinking about the eighth wave.

971
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
 Before it ruins the world...

972
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
 ...we have to fight it.

973
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
 But how, Professor?

974
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 We know that...

975
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 ...the eighth wave has recovered.

976
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 It's even stronger now.

977
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 The only way...

978
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 ...is to find the soul stone.

979
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 Find the soul stone.

980
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
 Okay.

981
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 Professor.

982
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 Let me go find it.

983
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
 Don't, Megatara.

984
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 This mission is too dangerous.

985
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 I don't want to involve the children.

986
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 We don't have to involve the children.

987
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
 It's better if...

988
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 ...me and the other professors...

989
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 ...go and complete this mission.

990
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
 That's the problem, Megatara.

991
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 We have to involve the children.

992
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 Because the soul stone is filled by the eighth wave.

993
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 It can only be seen by the children.

994
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
 "The eighth wave has recovered. The children are safe."

995
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 Where are you going?

996
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
 Don't touch me!

997
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 Let's go.

998
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
 I'm going to get the soul stone.

999
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 That's me.

1000
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 Don't touch me.

1001
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
 Let go of me!

1002
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 I don't want to.

1003
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 I don't want to.

1004
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
 I'll kill you.

1005
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
 You're a group again.

1006
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
 I love you.

1007
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 You're a group again.

1008
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
 Let's go.

1009
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
 Wait.

1010
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
 What are you doing?

1011
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 Who are you?

1012
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 Who are you?

1013
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 You're still alive.

1014
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 I know you're using the eighth wave.

1015
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
 Alva, where are you?

1016
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
 Alva!

1017
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
 Alva, come out!

1018
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 You scared me.

1019
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 I'm going to look for my father.

1020
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 I'm going home with my doll.

1021
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 That's not a doll.

1022
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 That's a lizard.

1023
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
 Alva, why did you bring the lizard here?

1024
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
 Where did it come from?

1025
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
 I saw a raptor attacking the lizard.

1026
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 A raptor?

1027
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 Yes, a raptor is a creature from the Angkara province.

1028
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 It attacked the lizard and fainted.

1029
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
 If the lizard lost, why did you bring it here?

1030
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
 Are you going to cure it?

1031
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 No, it's not a raptor.

1032
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
 Then?

1033
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 It's my father.

1034
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
 My father?

1035
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 Yes, my father is a raptor.

1036
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:39,000
 The raptor is so cute.

1037
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 Don't come near me.

1038
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 I'll give you a name.

1039
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 It's Blacky.

1040
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 Blacky?

1041
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 Why is it called Blacky?

1042
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
 Come here.

1043
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
 Let's go.

1044
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
 Wake up.

1045
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
 Let's play.

1046
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1047
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 Sir, I'm sorry.

1048
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 I promise I'll be a better man.

1049
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Sir.

1050
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 Sir.

1051
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 Okay.

1052
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
 I'll give you another chance.

1053
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 But don't fail.

1054
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 We don't have much time.

1055
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 We only have six hours before the sun sets.

1056
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 And I don't want the lizard to turn into a rat.

1057
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
 Do you understand?

1058
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 Okay, sir.

1059
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 I'll try.

1060
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1061
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 What do you want?

1062
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 I want you to come to my house.

1063
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 Don't you dare to attack the kid.

1064
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
 They are evil.

1065
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 They are evil.

1066
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
 No.

1067
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
 That's a lie.

1068
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 They are evil.

1069
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 Dad.

1070
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 Mom.

1071
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 Dad.

1072
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 Mom.

1073
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1074
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1075
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1076
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1077
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1078
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1079
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1080
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1081
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1082
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1083
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1084
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1085
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1086
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1087
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1088
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1089
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
 (Blacky's roar)

1090
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
 (Blacky's roar)
