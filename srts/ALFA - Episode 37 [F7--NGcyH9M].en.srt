If Alfa gets the soul stone, you have to snatch it.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't let Alfa destroy it. Do you understand?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Why does the ring have a black color?

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's like a feathered turtle's feather.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is it true that there's a soul stone in this ring?

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, it's impossible.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We're going to the school of the new year's eve.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There's a task for us.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What task?

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We have to find the third soul stone.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Find the soul stone?

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What does this mean?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The ring has a soul stone in it?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think they're going to take the third soul stone.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We have to follow them.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't fail, we're going to be punished for the darkness.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, boss.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Siyang, I'm home.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're home?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Are you hungry? I've cooked your favorite food.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, I'm going to take it.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have an important task from school.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm going to take it.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What task?

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Destroy the soul stone.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Destroy the soul stone?

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to destroy the soul stone.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Destroy the soul stone?

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes, because the darkness has 12 parts.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The only way to destroy the darkness is to destroy the soul.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But we have to do it one by one.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I think that task is too hard for you and your friends.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Aren't you afraid?

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I studied magic at school.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And I have a master's degree in magic.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Most of the time, the darkness loses.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We will get the status of the eighth prince.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And we will revive our father.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay?

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to take it.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You two, and you, please take care of my mother.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't worry, Alfa.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I will take care of your mother from all kinds of disturbances.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Disturbances?

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Akilah must be lonely being left by Alfa.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have to make her happy.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, no.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's not for her.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, that's not for her.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, no, no.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Guys, I'm sorry. I can't come.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Alfa, I'm sorry too. I can't come.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because I'm afraid.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Red.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, my mother is also angry with me because I'm afraid.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's all bad.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's okay.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you ready?

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, Alfa.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, then.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Bye.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go back.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, hurry up.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You guys take them to the lake.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why do you have to change your clothes?

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Why do you have to splash?

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Who said I wanted to splash to the lake?

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You two splash to the lake.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want to go to the lake.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Where is the boss? I thought he was splashing.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is fun.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm your boss.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you guys splash.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you're the boss, your job is to watch over the fruit.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm lazy.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you're playing, I'll report you to the police.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So you'll be punished.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, boss.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's just a splash.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hurry up, boss.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
One.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Two.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Three.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Did you hear that?

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Someone is splashing.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I heard it too.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I heard someone splashing.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But who?

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because Alfa, Vega, and Plita were the first ones to splash.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Just now?

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But...

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm confused.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Who was splashing?

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What?

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's Tommy, Mike, and Jack.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are they splashing?

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Mike and Jack are splashing.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But they're not told to run for their lives.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Maybe...

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let them splash to the lake.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going back to school.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's go.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Guys, stop.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What are you doing here?

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Stop asking questions.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We should be the ones asking.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What are Mike and Jack doing in the lake?

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, it's not that far.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There must be a secret.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There must be something.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Be quiet.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's go.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Tell me, why are Mike and Jack splashing?

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Tell me.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you don't want to answer, I'll give you another chance.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, my God.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll answer.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't get the wrong idea.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Mike and Jack are splashing to the lake to learn how to swim.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's right.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Seriously?

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you don't trust me,

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
you can fight with my dad.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you want to?

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're the one who's in charge of our school.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why do you want to do this to us?

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ask him.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't you dare.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll ask him.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There must be something between Tommy and you.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If you tell me something that you don't like,

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll tell you.

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I agree.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's go.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
[TOMMY & JACK ARE GOING TO THE LAKE]

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They're so fast.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They're really fast.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
[TOMMY & JACK ARE GOING TO THE LAKE]

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why is it getting dark?

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The sky is full of stars.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's run.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hi, Putri Duyung.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you know where Isana Duyung is?

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't know.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We want to ask her about the will.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's for the school.

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're in the wrong.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Our precious will has been stolen.

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Stolen?

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Do you know who stole it?

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Not yet.

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's why I'm here.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Whoever finds it,

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
will get a very precious gift.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm so dizzy.

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I've been looking for it for a long time.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What's in the will?

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is a painting of our legacy.

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It looks like my mother.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, it's not.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's not.

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's similar.

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What's wrong?

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why do you look so pale?

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Are you sick?

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No, I'm fine.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm working.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's go home.

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We'll tell our friends.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Putri Duyung, we're going home.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Be careful.

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Bye, Putri Duyung.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Help me, Jack.

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Thank you.

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We're lucky we didn't get eaten.

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
My back.

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're going to lose our track.

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We can get scolded by the boss.

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He's not that strong.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He can't handle the darkness.

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go home.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm scared.

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's still hot.

205
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's go.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
"The next day"

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm looking for Putri Duyung's legacy.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A ring.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Whoever finds it, will get a prize.

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Whoever finds it...

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
...will get a prize.

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's so cool, Jack.

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's so shiny.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's find it.

215
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We'll get a prize.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We can't be careless.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We should go first.

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We should go now.

219
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We should go first.

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We're all scared.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's go.

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
"The next day"

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I know.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll change my hair style.

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll get my hair done.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
"The next day"

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll change it.

228
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll get my hair done.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
"The next day"

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't be like this.

231
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll change it.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll get my hair done.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's better like this.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Thank you for taking me here.

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's better like this.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes.

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're welcome.

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's done.

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm not a kid anymore.

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why are you giving me a gift?

241
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This garden has a lot of beautiful memories.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
For me.

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Because this is where I first met you.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Agila.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You're right, Purwa.

246
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
A lot of beautiful things happened in this garden.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This garden...

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
has a lot of beautiful memories for me.

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
"The next day"

250
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You also invited me here?

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Purwa, who are you?

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm Purwa.

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why are you alone? Can I join you?

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Sure.

255
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll sit here.

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
"The next day"

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Purwa?

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What's wrong?

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Nothing.

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We should go back.

261
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Before they find us.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Okay.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The Duyung library was stolen?

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes.

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And we don't know who did it.

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Poor Duyung. They're confused.

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, they're confused.

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Because whoever finds the book...

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
will get a lot of prizes.

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
If that's the case,

272
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
we need the help of Professor Yasmin.

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, we can find out where the book is.

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's go.

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
"The next day"

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yasmin.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What's wrong?

278
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Be careful.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The thief...

280
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
is very smart, Prof.

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I can't get through him.

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Because I can see...

283
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
the fog is very thick.

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I can only see...

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the hands of a little boy who took the book.

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A little boy?

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
"The next day"

289
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
A little boy?

290
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Could he be the one who stole the book?

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The fog is very thick.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It feels like...

293
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
deja vu.

294
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What's deja vu?

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Deja vu...

296
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
feels like something unfamiliar.

297
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Like something that never happened before.

298
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Maybe...

299
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
he's the one who tried to scare us.

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Maybe he's the one.

301
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The boy is the same.

302
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But why did he steal Duyung's book?

303
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's what I don't know.

304
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's think about it later.

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Now, we should be careful.

306
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He must be waiting for us.

307
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, let's go.

308
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Where is it?

309
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't find it.

310
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's look for another book.

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll just...

312
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
read another book.

313
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This is...

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
a great book.

315
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's called...

316
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Madame Gemini.

317
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It can read...

318
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
100% accurate.

319
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I want to meet her.

320
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Why do we have to meet her?

321
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
She's a good teacher.

322
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
She can help us with our exams.

323
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
She can be our future teacher.

324
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
She's my future teacher.

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
She's good.

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Okay, I agree.

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is what we're looking for.

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Madame Gemini.

329
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But, what's the book for?

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What's the book for?

331
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We're looking for...

332
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
the thief of Duyung's book.

333
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's written here.

334
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If we're lucky,

335
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
we won't get lost.

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll read it.

337
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This is the code.

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
1000 kilometers from this school...

339
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
to there.

340
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So, we can leave tonight.

341
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We can arrive tomorrow morning.

342
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Where?

343
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There?

344
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
They're looking for a thief...

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
to steal Duyung's book.

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We have to follow them.

347
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We have to get Duyung's book.

348
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If we get it, we're in trouble.

349
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Guys, what's the matter?

350
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Nothing.

351
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What's wrong?

352
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Nothing.

353
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Nothing?

354
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sleepy.

355
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm going to bed.

356
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sleepy.

357
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sleepy too.

358
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm going to bed.

359
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's only this late,

360
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and I'm already sleepy.

361
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There must be something.

362
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm a thief.

363
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're not that far, Gembro.

364
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You're not like us.

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What's your plan?

366
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Listen to me.

367
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If we report this to the police,

368
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
because the police...

369
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
said that we're looking for him,

370
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
we'll get 2 books.

371
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And we can give them...

372
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
a reward.

373
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We'll get a gift from Duyung.

374
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Great!

375
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's a great idea.

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Who's going first?

377
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's fun.

378
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can meet...

379
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Pramal.

380
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I can also ask for a ride.

381
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I agree.

382
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It hurts.

383
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Here, take this.

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I thought you're going to do it.

385
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You're being a jerk.

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm talking about the soul stone.

387
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Not the soul.

388
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The value.

389
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Learn it.

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I know.

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm a good student.

392
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The soul stone is the ring I'm wearing.

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What should I do?

394
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
If I take off the ring,

395
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
my father will sleep again.

396
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What?

397
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What's wrong?

398
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Nothing.

399
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm just thinking.

400
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What are you thinking?

401
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
About Pramal.

402
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Should I go with her?

403
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm confused.

404
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm confused too.

405
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll think about it later.

406
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Where are you going?

407
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm going home.

408
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'll be back.

409
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Why is Alfa so weird?

410
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This is so funny.

411
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's normal for her to be the worst.

412
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
She's a soul stone.

413
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Why is she like this?

414
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm curious.

415
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I think Alfa is playing with her body.

416
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Or,

417
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
she's hiding something.

418
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's go.

419
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Did you lose it?

420
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes.

421
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yes, sir.

422
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Who dares to take the ring?

423
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's not me.

424
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But, sir.

425
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Just go to the beach.

426
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We'll find the ring for you.

427
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Wait.

428
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Where are your friends?

429
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, Gembrot.

430
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean, Boss.

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Are you sick?

432
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes, sir.

433
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
He's actually tired.

434
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
He's so weak.

435
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So, let's do it.

436
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So, we can continue the mission.

437
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay, sir.

438
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll give you a task.

439
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
To find the ring.

440
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yes, sir.

441
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Teleportation.

442
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And you, Garam.

443
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Go to the beach.

444
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Find the one who can do it.

445
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yes, sir.

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
[Gembrot]

447
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I found it.

448
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You found it?

449
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Where?

450
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Your book is in the magic school.

451
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In this building.

452
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
How come our book is in the magic school?

453
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So, they took it.

454
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We have to get our book back.

455
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Let's go there.

456
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's weird.

457
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Why is our book in the magic school?

458
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Who took it?

459
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Purwa.

460
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Where are you taking me?

461
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I just...

462
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I just took Akila out.

463
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
[Purwa]

464
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Purwa.

465
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Are you pretending to be stupid?

466
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Or are you really stupid?

467
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What if someone sees us?

468
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Hey, I'm not that kind of guy.

469
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You're talking about Akila, right?

470
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Not a girlfriend.

471
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I just want to win her heart.

472
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's hard for you to say that.

473
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You're saying that I'm stupid or what?

474
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes, you're stupid.

475
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You're stupid.

476
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Look at me.

477
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Purwa.

478
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Panji.

479
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What's wrong with you?

480
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Why are you shouting?

481
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's nothing.

482
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Excuse me.

483
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Um...

484
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Alfa.

485
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
How's your assignment from Professor Aldebaran?

486
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Is it done?

487
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:50,000
This is your inheritance.

488
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
[Alfa]

489
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Merik.

490
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
This ring is really similar to the one in the dune.

491
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Alfa.

492
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What are you thinking?

493
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm going, ma'am.

495
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Where are you going?

496
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's late.

497
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm looking for the missing white sandal.

498
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So, my friends and I are going to a funeral home.

499
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's called Madame Gemini.

500
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So, you're leaving your mom again?

501
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't think so.

502
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I really want to be with my mom.

503
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Do you want to come with me?

504
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
[To be continued...]

505
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Feel it, Tommy.

506
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That's why you should not be a coward.

507
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:18,000
[We can do this!]

508
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Alfa looks like Professor Purwa.

509
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes, she does.

510
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Since when did she become Professor Purwa's student?

511
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There's Paji, too.

512
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Usually, they're in the kitchen.

513
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
How could that be?

514
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Then, who's that girl?

515
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What are you doing here?

516
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Agu Hila, wear your Jubah Jeb.

517
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Come on.

518
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Jubah.

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Mom.

520
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Now, answer my question.

521
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Why did you peep into my house?

522
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Answer.

523
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yes, sir. We just want to follow Alfa.

524
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
For what?

525
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Answer my question.

526
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes, sir.

527
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We want to steal.

528
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
A man.

529
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
A man can't lose.

530
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We won't have a boyfriend.

531
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You're so mean.

532
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You peeped into my house.

533
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You'll get your punishment.

534
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You'll see.

535
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Calm down, sir.

536
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm just here to see Paji.

537
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't worry. I still have business with Professor Purwa.

538
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I'll decide...

539
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
if I'll come with you to Madam Gemini's house.

540
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yes.

541
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Where are you going?

542
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You want to skip school again?

543
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We have an important task, sir.

544
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So, we're leaving tonight.

545
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So, we'll be back tomorrow morning.

546
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes, sir.

547
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's right, sir.

548
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Goodbye, Professor.

549
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Goodbye, Paji.

550
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I have to find Alfa again.

551
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I have to find information about the soul stone.

552
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
"The soul stone is in the basement."

553
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Where are Rih and Tole?

554
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
They should be back at the dormitory.

555
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That's weird.

556
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Mike and Jack are not here.

557
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This is so annoying.

558
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Why can't I get any information?

559
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Here.

560
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I have a headache.

561
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm going to ask Julia.

562
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm afraid I'll get a cold when I fly.

563
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Me too.

564
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'll wait here.

565
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I have to get my motorcycle ready.

566
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Alfa.

567
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I can't wait.

568
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I think our trip will be fun.

569
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm glad if you're happy.

570
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
What if the spirit says...

571
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
the soul stone is in your hand?

572
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What should I do?

573
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What's wrong?

574
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Why are you so tense?

575
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I promise I won't make you uncomfortable.

576
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Calm down.

577
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I remember your father used to be adventurous like you.

578
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
They like to travel.

579
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Just like you.

580
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Don't be so loud.

581
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You'll get caught.

582
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's try to hide.

583
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So, it won't be seen.

584
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:26,000
That's Alfa.

585
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Where is she going?

586
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
She's carrying a backpack.

587
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I think she's going far.

588
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I have to find out.

589
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Who is that?

590
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Why is Alfa's child peeping?

591
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Alfa.

592
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Your child is peeping.

593
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's behind the pillar.

594
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It must be Tommy.

595
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
If he's in, this plan will be a mess.

596
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm going.

597
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Don't show up.

598
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Where are you going?

599
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm going to meet my friends.

600
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'll wait for Alfa outside.

601
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Where is Alfa?

602
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
She's running so fast.

603
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I have to find her.

604
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But, where is she going?

605
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'll go there.

606
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I knew it.

607
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's why I'm not a good person.

608
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll go back to the corridor.

609
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
"I'm going to meet my friends."

610
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Feel it, Tommy.

611
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That's why I'm not a good person.

612
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'll go back to the corridor.

613
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Where is the toilet?

614
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I haven't gone back yet.

615
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's weird.

616
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Ma'am, did you see Ray and Tole?

617
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Ma'am?

618
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Ray, who were you talking to?

619
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Ray, Tole.

620
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I wasn't talking to anyone.

621
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I think I heard you talking to someone.

622
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's Tommy.

623
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
He wanted to follow me.

624
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
That's why I'm following him.

625
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So, he won't go.

626
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Let's go.

627
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Wait.

628
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What's wrong?

629
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Let's go.

630
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Where is he?

631
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He's not here.

632
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Come on.

633
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Let's go.

634
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Putri Duyung.

635
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
What are you doing here?

636
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Aldebaran.

637
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The heirloom of the Kamiblon kingdom.

638
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
According to the Power Sakti fish,

639
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
the heirloom is in one of the buildings in the school.

640
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
How is it possible that the heirloom is here?

641
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The Power Sakti fish can't be wrong.

642
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So, we'll start to investigate.

643
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Everyone, go.

644
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Wait.

645
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay.

646
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'll let you investigate this school.

647
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But, I have to go.

648
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
To keep an eye on him.

649
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
He's just arrived.

650
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He's so slow.

651
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
He's tired.

652
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't know.

653
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We're going to the toilet.

654
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Let's go.

655
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:44,000
What?

656
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Why didn't you say anything?

657
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
What?

658
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Where's your brother?

659
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh, right.

660
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm sorry.

661
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That's Alfa.

662
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Luckily, he's not here.

663
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Why is it so heavy?

664
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What's heavy?

665
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Well...

666
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Nothing.

667
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Mom.

668
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Why did you make us do this?

669
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Where have you been?

670
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I want to be alone.

671
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Who do you want to be with?

672
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Why didn't you tell me?

673
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You're ready, right?

674
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
We're ready, Miss.

675
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Hold it tight.

676
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Alfa.

677
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
If we don't hold it tight, we'll fall.

678
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I know.

679
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That's right.

680
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Let's go.

681
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Alfa is so weird today.

682
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
She's not focused.

683
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Why is she so weird?

684
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't know.

685
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Let's count down.

686
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
We'll fly.

687
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
No need to count.

688
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
One, two, three.

689
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Let's fly.

690
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Let's go.

691
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Let's fly.

692
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I know that Madan...

693
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
loves Dangdut song.

694
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What?

695
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:04,000
We can do it.

696
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I think it's done.

697
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
One more.

698
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The soy sauce.

699
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Let's go.

700
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's so good.

701
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Akilah will love this.

702
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Akilah.

703
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Lunch is served.

704
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Why did you call me?

705
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It looks good.

706
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
For me?

707
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm calling Akilah...

708
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
for lunch.

709
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Not because I'm hungry.

710
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Why are you laughing?

711
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
What's so funny?

712
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's been a long time.

713
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Since we were in school.

714
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I never forget it.

715
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I always miss you.

716
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What's the news?

717
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Akilah has left.

718
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Akilah has left?

719
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yes.

720
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm going to cook.

721
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm going to...

722
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What's going on?

723
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Tuyuk.

724
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
What are they doing here?

725
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
They're here to raid your house.

726
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Raid my house?

727
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
For what?

728
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
According to the power source.

729
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The lost King of Duyung's book is here.

730
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Duyung's book?

731
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Don't mess with my stuff.

732
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
What?

733
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Is it true?

734
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Don't.

735
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Professor Odebar.

736
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I know who can do this.

737
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It must be Panji.

738
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Don't you dare to talk back.

739
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yes.

740
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Panji.

741
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Calm down.

742
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We're sure that it's here.

743
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But it's weird. Why can't we find it?

744
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It means that only one thing.

745
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The power source.

746
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Alright. We'll go.

747
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But we'll find our lost book.

748
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'll find it.

749
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I must have Panji.

750
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:52,000
We're here.

751
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Gosh.

752
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The queue is long.

753
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yes.

754
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The queue is long.

755
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yes.

756
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's okay.

757
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Come on.

758
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Only the one who can make me happy.

759
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The one I'm close to.

760
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What?

761
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What's wrong?

762
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I miss you.

763
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
What are you looking at?

764
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm looking for the lost book.

765
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I must find it.

766
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Who knows the book is in him.

767
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
"The lost book"

768
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's here.

769
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Bargi will always wait for Panji.

770
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
"The lost book"

771
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It turns out that you're handsome.

772
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You have a monster's taste.

773
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Cing!

774
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You're always taking people's stuff.

775
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm warning you.

776
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Don't ever touch my stuff.

777
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Why?

778
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Are you afraid that I'll take your beloved monster?

779
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I'll take your mouth.

780
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Feel it.

781
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You're so big.

782
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'll eat you.

783
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Move.

784
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It turns out that you're handsome.

785
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,000
What's wrong?

786
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Hang on.

787
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What are you doing?

788
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I'm looking for the lost book.

789
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
"The lost book"

790
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's here.

791
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It's not here.

792
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Angkara, let us go.

793
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Angkara.

794
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Let me be happy first.

795
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Then, I'll do whatever you want.

796
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Okay.

797
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I'll do it.

798
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
In the past, there was a princess...

799
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
...who was ugly.

800
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
No.

801
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I don't want to tell the story of a princess...

802
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
...who was far away from her lover.

803
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I want to tell the story of a princess who was far away from her lover.

804
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm bored, Mbak Mbirbi.

805
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I know how to do it.

806
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Get the tarot card.

807
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
What's wrong with you?

808
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You're so rude.

809
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I don't want to be rude to you.

810
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Don't be rude.

811
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It's hard to be with her.

812
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I don't want to do anything.

813
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I think I know her.

814
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
What's wrong with you?

815
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
...one in a million.

816
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So, if someone needs help, there's only one condition.

817
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Dance in front of him.

818
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Alfa.

819
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I know how to make him happy.

820
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You have to dance in front of him.

821
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Dangdut?

822
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yes, Dangdut.

823
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I know him, Alfa.

824
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
He's my teacher.

825
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Madam, can you give me another chance?

826
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
We'll think about how to make you happy.

827
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Okay.

828
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
One more time.

829
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Okay, let's go out.

830
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Madam, we'll go out first.

831
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Let's go.

832
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I know you like Dangdut song.

833
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Huh? Dangdut?

834
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
That's why we have to practice it first.

835
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I don't know how to make him happy.

836
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Do you know where it's from?

837
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Did you read it from a book?

838
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I don't think so.

839
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
If we make a mistake, he might get angry.

840
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And he won't practice it.

841
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That's impossible.

842
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'm sure someone will tell me that he likes Dangdut.

843
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That's why we have to dance in front of him.

844
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I want to go home.

845
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:21,000
We can do this!

846
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Can you do it?

847
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Shut up!

848
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Don't follow me!

849
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You're following me!

850
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:46,000
That's it.

851
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
What?

852
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
If you keep doing this, we'll never pass.

853
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yes, that's right.

854
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Then, what should we do?

855
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
How about this?

856
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Hurry up.

857
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Bite this rope until it's loose.

858
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Why do I have to bite this rope?

859
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
This is so complicated.

860
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I have an idea.

861
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So, I'll be the first one to do it.

862
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Hurry up.

863
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Just do it.

864
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
When I'm free, I'll let you do it.

865
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Come on.

866
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Okay.

867
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Hurry up.

868
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Don't move.

869
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:42,000
What the heck?

870
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

871
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm sorry.

872
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I can't control myself.

873
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I had to throw it.

874
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Hurry up.

875
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Let go of this.

876
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It's still smelly.

877
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Just blow it.

878
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Let the smell go.

879
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Hurry up.

880
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You're so slow.

881
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Don't move.

882
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Don't ever touch my stuff again.

883
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Remember that.

884
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Okay.

885
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
By the way, we have to do it properly.

886
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm afraid that we'll be chased.

887
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yes.

888
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Luckily, you're not in danger.

889
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
What?

890
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
My rope.

891
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Hurry up.

892
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Don't touch it.

893
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
No.

894
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Come on.

895
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Let's go.

896
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'll go first.

897
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Okay.

898
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Sir.

899
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Wait.

900
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Wait for a minute.

901
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Okay.

902
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Wait.

903
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
What's wrong?

904
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
It's neat.

905
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Be patient.

906
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Okay.

907
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Let's go.

908
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Fly.

909
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm very smart.

910
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I'll fly.

911
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Fly?

912
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Yes.

913
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's go.

914
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm very smart.

915
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They must think that I'm gone.

916
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Now, I just have to follow them...

917
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
...to find out where Alfa is.

918
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Fly.

919
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'm a recorder type.

920
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You're smart.

921
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
But, how do you dance?

922
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Maybe, I'll show you later.

923
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'll show you.

924
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
What's that sound?

925
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Stop it!

926
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I want to go to the toilet!

927
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What's wrong?

928
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Why is the police so troublesome?

929
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
What if our mission fails?

930
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't know.

931
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
What if the dark lord is angry with us?

932
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
We'll tell him, "What are you doing?"

933
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So, you're accusing me?

934
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And this is against me?

935
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Don't use me in all kinds of ways.

936
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Okay, okay.

937
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm a coward.

938
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Coward?

939
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Let's focus.

940
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
So, our movement will be better.

941
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Okay.

942
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Who's that?

943
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Hello, everyone.

944
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Who are you?

945
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I saw you from there.

946
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You're practicing dancing, right?

947
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It's good, but it's not compact enough.

948
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
How about I help you practice...

949
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
...dancing together, but it has to be compact.

950
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Really?

951
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
But, you won't pay me, right?

952
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Of course not.

953
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Just relax.

954
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It's all free.

955
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yes!

956
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Okay.

957
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Music.

958
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Put your thumbs up.

959
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Move your shoulders.

960
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Bye.

961
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I hope they'll be challenged by Professor Aldebaran...

962
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
...so that they'll be expelled from this school.

963
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We can do it.

964
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,980
is it okay?

you're all smart kids

968
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,980
you can do everything

969
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,980
who's the teacher?

970
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,980
aunt

971
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,980
yes

972
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:22,980
but, what if we don't know her?

973
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:29,980
it's okay, you can call her aunt

974
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,980
now, you can continue your work

975
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,980
thank you, aunt

976
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,980
we're going to meet Dili

977
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:40,980
you're welcome

978

good afternoon, kids

988

good afternoon, teacher

989
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:18,980
where's Alfa, Vega, Rey, Tole, and Plita?

990
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,980
I can't see Jack and Mac

991
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,980
they're not here

992
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,980

yes, teacher

994
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:32,980
Alfa, Vega, Rey, Tole, and Plita are not here

995
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,980
where are they?

996

I don't know

997
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:40,980

yes

1004
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,980
I hope they're admitted to Aldebaran

1005
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,980
so, they can be expelled from this school

01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,980
promise me, if you're happy, you'll take care of us

1010
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:31,980
don't worry, I never break my promise

what should I do?

1022
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:55,980
I want you to check the missing white paper

1023
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,980

01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,980
you're lying

01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,980
she's our friend

01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,980
it's a bad omen

01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,980
you're talking nonsense

01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,980

you dare to Madam

01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:45,980
what Madam Gemini meant is me

1052
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:49,980
but how can I use the crystal ball?

1053
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:53,980

Madam Gemini said that the crystal ball is in a woman's hand

what do you mean?
