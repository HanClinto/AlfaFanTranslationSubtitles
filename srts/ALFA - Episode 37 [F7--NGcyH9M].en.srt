00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000

 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, run with courage

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 If Alva gets the soul stone, you have to snatch it.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Don't let Alva destroy it. Do you understand?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Why does the ring have a black color?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 It's like a feathered turtle's feather.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Is it true that there's a soul stone in this ring?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 No, it's impossible.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We're going to the school of the new year's eve.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 There's a task for us.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 What task?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 We have to find the third soul stone.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Find the soul stone?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 What does this mean?

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 The ring has a soul stone in it?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I think they're going to take the third soul stone.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We have to follow them.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Don't fail, we're going to be punished for the darkness.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Yes, boss.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Let's go.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Siyang, I'm home.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 You're home?

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Are you hungry? I've cooked your favorite food.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 No, I'm going to take it.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I have an important task from school.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I'm going to take it.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 What task?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Destroy the soul stone.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Destroy the soul stone?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm going to destroy the soul stone.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I'm going to destroy the soul stone.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I'm going to destroy the soul stone.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Destroy the soul stone?

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Yes, because the darkness has 12 parts.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 The only way to destroy the darkness is to destroy the soul.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But we have to do it one by one.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 But I think that task is too hard for you and your friends.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Aren't you afraid?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I studied magic at school.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And I have a master's degree in magic.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Most of the time, the darkness loses.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 We will get the status of the eighth prince.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And we will revive our father.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Okay?

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I'm going to take it.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 You two, and you, please take care of my mother.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Don't worry, Alva.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I will take care of your mother from all kinds of disturbances.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Disturbances?

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Akilah must be lonely being left by Alva.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I have to make her happy.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 No, no.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 That's not for her.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 No, that's not for her.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 No, no, no.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Guys, I'm sorry. I can't come.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Alva, I'm sorry too. I can't come.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Because I'm afraid.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Red.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Yes, my mother is also angry with me because I'm afraid.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It's all bad.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 It's okay.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Are you ready?

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Yes, Alva.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Okay, then.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Bye.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Let's go back.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Okay, hurry up.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 You guys take them to the lake.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Why do you have to change your clothes?

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Why do you have to splash?

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Who said I wanted to splash to the lake?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You two splash to the lake.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I want to go to the lake.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Where is the boss? I thought he was splashing.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yes.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 This is fun.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I'm your boss.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So you guys splash.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 If you're the boss, your job is to watch over the fruit.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I'm lazy.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 If you're playing, I'll report you to the police.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 So you'll be punished.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 No, boss.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 That's just a splash.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Hurry up, boss.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 One.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Two.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Three.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Did you hear that?

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Someone is splashing.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I heard it too.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I heard someone splashing.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But who?

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Because Alva, Vega, and Plita were the first ones to splash.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Just now?

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Yes.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 But...

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I'm confused.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Who was splashing?

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 What?

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 That's Tommy, Mike, and Jack.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Why are they splashing?

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Mike and Jack are splashing.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yes.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But they're not told to run for their lives.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Maybe...

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Let them splash to the lake.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I'm going back to school.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Let's go.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Guys, stop.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 What are you doing here?

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Stop asking questions.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 We should be the ones asking.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 What are Mike and Jack doing in the lake?

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 No, it's not that far.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 There must be a secret.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 There must be something.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Be quiet.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Let's go.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Tell me, why are Mike and Jack splashing?

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Tell me.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 If you don't want to answer, I'll give you another chance.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Oh, my God.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I'll answer.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Don't get the wrong idea.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Mike and Jack are splashing to the lake to learn how to swim.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 That's right.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Seriously?

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 If you don't trust me,

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 you can fight with my dad.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Do you want to?

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 No.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 You're the one who's in charge of our school.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Why do you want to do this to us?

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Ask him.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Don't you dare.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I'll ask him.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I'll ask him.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 There must be something between Tommy and you.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 If you tell me something that you don't like,

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I'll tell you.

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I agree.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Let's go.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 [TOMMY & JACK ARE GOING TO THE LAKE]

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 They're so fast.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They're really fast.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 [TOMMY & JACK ARE GOING TO THE LAKE]

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Why is it getting dark?

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 The sky is full of stars.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Let's run.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Hi, Putri Duyung.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Do you know where Isana Duyung is?

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I don't know.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 We want to ask her about the will.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Yes.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 It's for the school.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 You're in the wrong.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Our precious will has been stolen.

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Stolen?

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Do you know who stole it?

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Not yet.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 That's why I'm here.

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Whoever finds it,

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 will get a very precious gift.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I'm so dizzy.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I've been looking for it for a long time.

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 What's in the will?

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 This is a painting of our legacy.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 It looks like my mother.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 No, it's not.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It's not.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It's similar.

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 What's wrong?

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Why do you look so pale?

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Are you sick?

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 No, I'm fine.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I'm working.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Let's go home.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 We'll tell our friends.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Okay.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Putri Duyung, we're going home.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Be careful.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Bye, Putri Duyung.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 No.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Help me, Jack.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Thank you.

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 We're lucky we didn't get eaten.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 My back.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 We're going to lose our track.

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 We can get scolded by the boss.

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 He's not that strong.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 He can't handle the darkness.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Let's go home.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I'm scared.

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's still hot.

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Let's go.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 "The next day"

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I'm looking for Putri Duyung's legacy.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 A ring.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Whoever finds it, will get a prize.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Whoever finds it...

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 ...will get a prize.

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 It's so cool, Jack.

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It's so shiny.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Let's find it.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 We'll get a prize.

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 We can't be careless.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 We should go first.

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 We should go now.

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 We should go first.

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 We're all scared.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Let's go.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 "The next day"

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I know.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I'll change my hair style.

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 I'll get my hair done.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 "The next day"

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I'll change it.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I'll get my hair done.

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 "The next day"

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 "The next day"

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Don't be like this.

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I'll change it.

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I'll get my hair done.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's better like this.

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Thank you for taking me here.

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 It's better like this.

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Yes.

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 You're welcome.

245
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It's done.

246
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I'm not a kid anymore.

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Why are you giving me a gift?

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 This garden has a lot of beautiful memories.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 For me.

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Because this is where I first met you.

251
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Agila.

252
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 You're right, Purwa.

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 A lot of beautiful things happened in this garden.

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 This garden...

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 has a lot of beautiful memories for me.

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 "The next day"

257
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 You also invited me here?

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Purwa, who are you?

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 I'm Purwa.

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Why are you alone? Can I join you?

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Sure.

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I'll sit here.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 "The next day"

264
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Purwa?

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 What's wrong?

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Nothing.

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 We should go back.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Before they find us.

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Okay.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 What?

271
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 The Duyung library was stolen?

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Yes.

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And we don't know who did it.

274
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Poor Duyung. They're confused.

275
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Yes, they're confused.

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Because whoever finds the book...

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 will get a lot of prizes.

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 If that's the case,

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 we need the help of Professor Yasmin.

280
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 So, we can find out where the book is.

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Let's go.

282
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 "The next day"

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Yasmin.

284
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 What's wrong?

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 What's wrong?

286
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Be careful.

287
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 The thief...

288
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 is very smart, Prof.

289
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And I can't get through him.

290
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Because I can see...

291
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 the fog is very thick.

292
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And I can only see...

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 the hands of a little boy who took the book.

294
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 A little boy?

295
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Yes.

296
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 "The next day"

297
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 A little boy?

298
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Could he be the one who stole the book?

299
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 The fog is very thick.

300
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 It feels like...

301
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 deja vu.

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 What's deja vu?

303
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Deja vu...

304
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 feels like something unfamiliar.

305
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Like something that never happened before.

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Maybe...

307
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 he's the one who tried to scare us.

308
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Maybe he's the one.

309
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Maybe he's the one.

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 The boy is the same.

311
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But why did he steal Duyung's book?

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 That's what I don't know.

313
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Let's think about it later.

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Now, we should be careful.

315
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 He must be waiting for us.

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Yes, let's go.

317
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Where is it?

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I can't find it.

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Let's look for another book.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I'll just...

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 read another book.

322
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 This is...

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 a great book.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 It's called...

325
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Madame Gemini.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It can read...

327
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 100% accurate.

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I want to meet her.

329
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I want to meet her.

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Why do we have to meet her?

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 She's a good teacher.

332
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 She can help us with our exams.

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 She can be our future teacher.

334
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 She's my future teacher.

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 She's good.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Okay, I agree.

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 This is what we're looking for.

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Madame Gemini.

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But, what's the book for?

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 What's the book for?

341
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 We're looking for...

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 the thief of Duyung's book.

343
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It's written here.

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 If we're lucky,

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 we won't get lost.

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I'll read it.

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 This is the code.

348
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 1000 kilometers from this school...

349
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 to there.

350
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 So, we can leave tonight.

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 We can arrive tomorrow morning.

352
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Where?

353
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 There?

354
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 They're looking for a thief...

355
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 to steal Duyung's book.

356
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 We have to follow them.

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 We have to get Duyung's book.

358
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 If we get it, we're in trouble.

359
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Guys, what's the matter?

360
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Nothing.

361
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 What's wrong?

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Nothing.

363
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Nothing?

364
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I'm sleepy.

365
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 I'm going to bed.

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I'm sleepy.

367
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I'm sleepy too.

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I'm going to bed.

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I'm going to bed.

370
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It's only this late,

371
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 and I'm already sleepy.

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 There must be something.

373
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 I'm a thief.

374
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 You're not that far, Gembro.

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 You're not like us.

376
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 What's your plan?

377
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Listen to me.

378
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 If we report this to the police,

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 because the police...

380
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 said that we're looking for him,

381
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 we'll get 2 books.

382
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And we can give them...

383
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 a reward.

384
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 We'll get a gift from Duyung.

385
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Great!

386
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 That's a great idea.

387
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Who's going first?

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 That's fun.

389
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I can meet...

390
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Pramal.

391
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I can also ask for a ride.

392
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I agree.

393
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 It hurts.

394
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Here, take this.

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 I thought you're going to do it.

396
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 You're being a jerk.

397
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 I'm talking about the soul stone.

398
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Not the soul.

399
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 The value.

400
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Learn it.

401
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I know.

402
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 I'm a good student.

403
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 The soul stone is the ring I'm wearing.

404
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 What should I do?

405
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 If I take off the ring,

406
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 my father will sleep again.

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 What?

408
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 What's wrong?

409
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Nothing.

410
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I'm just thinking.

411
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 What are you thinking?

412
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 About Pramal.

413
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Should I go with her?

414
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I'm confused.

415
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I'm confused too.

416
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I'll think about it later.

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Where are you going?

418
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 I'm going home.

419
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I'll be back.

420
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Why is Alva so weird?

421
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 This is so funny.

422
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 It's normal for her to be the worst.

423
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 She's a soul stone.

424
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Why is she like this?

425
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I'm curious.

426
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I think Alva is playing with her body.

427
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Or,

428
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 she's hiding something.

429
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Let's go.

430
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Did you lose it?

431
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Yes.

432
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Yes, sir.

433
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Who dares to take the ring?

434
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 It's not me.

435
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But, sir.

436
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Just go to the beach.

437
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 We'll find the ring for you.

438
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Wait.

439
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Where are your friends?

440
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Oh, Gembrot.

441
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I mean, Boss.

442
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Are you sick?

443
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Yes, sir.

444
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 He's actually tired.

445
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 He's so weak.

446
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 So, let's do it.

447
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 So, we can continue the mission.

448
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Okay, sir.

449
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I'll give you a task.

450
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 To find the ring.

451
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Yes, sir.

452
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Teleportation.

453
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And you, Garam.

454
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Go to the beach.

455
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Find the one who can do it.

456
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Yes, sir.

457
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 [Gembrot]

458
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I found it.

459
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 You found it?

460
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Where?

461
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Your book is in the magic school.

462
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 In this building.

463
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 How come our book is in the magic school?

464
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 So, they took it.

465
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 We have to get our book back.

466
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Let's go there.

467
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 That's weird.

468
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Why is our book in the magic school?

469
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Who took it?

470
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Purwa.

471
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Purwa.

472
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Where are you taking me?

473
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I just...

474
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I just took Akila out.

475
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 [Purwa]

476
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Purwa.

477
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Are you pretending to be stupid?

478
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Or are you really stupid?

479
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 What if someone sees us?

480
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Hey, I'm not that kind of guy.

481
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 You're talking about Akila, right?

482
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Not a girlfriend.

483
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I just want to win her heart.

484
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 It's hard for you to say that.

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You're saying that I'm stupid or what?

486
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Yes, you're stupid.

487
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 You're stupid.

488
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Look at me.

489
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Purwa.

490
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Panji.

491
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 What's wrong with you?

492
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Why are you shouting?

493
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 It's nothing.

494
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Excuse me.

495
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Um...

496
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Alva.

497
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 How's your assignment from Professor Aldebaran?

498
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Is it done?

499
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 This is your inheritance.

500
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 [Alva]

501
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Merik.

502
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 This ring is really similar to the one in the dune.

503
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Alva.

504
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 What are you thinking?

505
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Yes, ma'am.

506
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I'm going, ma'am.

507
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Where are you going?

508
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It's late.

509
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I'm looking for the missing white sandal.

510
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So, my friends and I are going to a funeral home.

511
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 It's called Madame Gemini.

512
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 So, you're leaving your mom again?

513
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I don't think so.

514
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 I really want to be with my mom.

515
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Do you want to come with me?

516
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 [To be continued...]

517
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 [To be continued...]

518
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Feel it, Tommy.

519
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 That's why you should not be a coward.

520
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 [We can do this!]

521
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 [We can do this!]

522
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Alva looks like Professor Purwa.

523
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Yes, she does.

524
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Since when did she become Professor Purwa's student?

525
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 There's Paji, too.

526
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Usually, they're in the kitchen.

527
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 How could that be?

528
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Then, who's that girl?

529
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 What are you doing here?

530
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Agu Hila, wear your Jubah Jeb.

531
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Come on.

532
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Jubah.

533
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Mom.

534
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Now, answer my question.

535
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Why did you peep into my house?

536
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Answer.

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Yes, sir. We just want to follow Alva.

538
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 For what?

539
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Answer my question.

540
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Yes, sir.

541
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 We want to steal.

542
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 A man.

543
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 A man can't lose.

544
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 We won't have a boyfriend.

545
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 You're so mean.

546
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 You peeped into my house.

547
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 You'll get your punishment.

548
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 You'll see.

549
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Calm down, sir.

550
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 I'm just here to see Paji.

551
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Don't worry. I still have business with Professor Purwa.

552
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 And I'll decide...

553
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 if I'll come with you to Madam Gemini's house.

554
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Yes.

555
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Where are you going?

556
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 You want to skip school again?

557
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 We have an important task, sir.

558
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 So, we're leaving tonight.

559
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 So, we'll be back tomorrow morning.

560
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Yes, sir.

561
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 That's right, sir.

562
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Goodbye, Professor.

563
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Goodbye, Paji.

564
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Goodbye, Paji.

565
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 I have to find Alva again.

566
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 I have to find information about the soul stone.

567
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 "The soul stone is in the basement."

568
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Where are Rih and Tole?

569
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 They should be back at the dormitory.

570
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 That's weird.

571
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Mike and Jack are not here.

572
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 This is so annoying.

573
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Why can't I get any information?

574
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Here.

575
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 I have a headache.

576
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 I'm going to ask Julia.

577
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I'm afraid I'll get a cold when I fly.

578
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Me too.

579
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I'll wait here.

580
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 I have to get my motorcycle ready.

581
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Alva.

582
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I can't wait.

583
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 I think our trip will be fun.

584
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I'm glad if you're happy.

585
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 What if the spirit says...

586
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 the soul stone is in your hand?

587
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 What should I do?

588
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 What's wrong?

589
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Why are you so tense?

590
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 I promise I won't make you uncomfortable.

591
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Calm down.

592
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 I remember your father used to be adventurous like you.

593
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 They like to travel.

594
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Just like you.

595
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Don't be so loud.

596
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 You'll get caught.

597
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Let's try to hide.

598
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 So, it won't be seen.

599
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 That's Alva.

600
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Where is she going?

601
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 She's carrying a backpack.

602
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 I think she's going far.

603
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 I have to find out.

604
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Who is that?

605
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Why is Alva's child peeping?

606
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Alva.

607
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Your child is peeping.

608
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 It's behind the pillar.

609
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 It must be Tommy.

610
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 If he's in, this plan will be a mess.

611
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 I'm going.

612
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Don't show up.

613
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Where are you going?

614
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I'm going to meet my friends.

615
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 I'm going to meet my friends.

616
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 I'll wait for Alva outside.

617
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Where is Alva?

618
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 She's running so fast.

619
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 I have to find her.

620
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 But, where is she going?

621
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 I'll go there.

622
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 I knew it.

623
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 That's why I'm not a good person.

624
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 I'll go back to the corridor.

625
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 "I'm going to meet my friends."

626
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Feel it, Tommy.

627
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 That's why I'm not a good person.

628
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 I'll go back to the corridor.

629
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Where is the toilet?

630
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 I haven't gone back yet.

631
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 That's weird.

632
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Ma'am, did you see Ray and Tole?

633
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Ma'am?

634
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Ma'am?

635
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Ma'am?

636
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Ma'am?

637
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Ray, who were you talking to?

638
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Ray, Tole.

639
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 I wasn't talking to anyone.

640
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 I think I heard you talking to someone.

641
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 That's Tommy.

642
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 He wanted to follow me.

643
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 That's why I'm following him.

644
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 So, he won't go.

645
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Let's go.

646
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Wait.

647
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 What's wrong?

648
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Let's go.

649
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Where is he?

650
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 He's not here.

651
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Come on.

652
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Let's go.

653
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Let's go.

654
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Let's go.

655
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Putri Duyung.

656
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 What are you doing here?

657
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Aldebaran.

658
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 The heirloom of the Kamiblon kingdom.

659
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 According to the Power Sakti fish,

660
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 the heirloom is in one of the buildings in the school.

661
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 How is it possible that the heirloom is here?

662
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 The Power Sakti fish can't be wrong.

663
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 So, we'll start to investigate.

664
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Everyone, go.

665
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Wait.

666
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Okay.

667
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I'll let you investigate this school.

668
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 But, I have to go.

669
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 To keep an eye on him.

670
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 He's just arrived.

671
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 He's so slow.

672
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 He's tired.

673
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 I don't know.

674
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 We're going to the toilet.

675
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Let's go.

676
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 What?

677
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Why didn't you say anything?

678
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 What?

679
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Where's your brother?

680
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Oh, right.

681
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 I'm sorry.

682
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 That's Alva.

683
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Luckily, he's not here.

684
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 Why is it so heavy?

685
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 What's heavy?

686
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Well...

687
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Nothing.

688
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Mom.

689
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Why did you make us do this?

690
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 Where have you been?

691
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 I want to be alone.

692
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 Who do you want to be with?

693
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Why didn't you tell me?

694
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 You're ready, right?

695
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 We're ready, Miss.

696
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Hold it tight.

697
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Hold it tight.

698
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Alva.

699
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 If we don't hold it tight, we'll fall.

700
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I know.

701
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 That's right.

702
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 That's right.

703
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Let's go.

704
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Alva is so weird today.

705
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 She's not focused.

706
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Why is she so weird?

707
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 I don't know.

708
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 Let's count down.

709
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 We'll fly.

710
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 No need to count.

711
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 One, two, three.

712
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Let's fly.

713
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Let's go.

714
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Let's fly.

715
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 I know that Madan...

716
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 loves Dangdut song.

717
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 What?

718
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 We can do it.

719
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 We can do it.

720
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 I think it's done.

721
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 One more.

722
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 The soy sauce.

723
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Let's go.

724
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 It's so good.

725
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 Akilah will love this.

726
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Akilah.

727
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Akilah.

728
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Lunch is served.

729
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Why did you call me?

730
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 It looks good.

731
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 For me?

732
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 I'm calling Akilah...

733
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 for lunch.

734
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Not because I'm hungry.

735
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Why are you laughing?

736
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 What's so funny?

737
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 It's been a long time.

738
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 Since we were in school.

739
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 I never forget it.

740
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 I always miss you.

741
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 What's the news?

742
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Akilah has left.

743
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Akilah has left?

744
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Yes.

745
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 I'm going to cook.

746
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 I'm going to...

747
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 I'm going to...

748
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 What's going on?

749
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Tuyuk.

750
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 What are they doing here?

751
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 They're here to raid your house.

752
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Raid my house?

753
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 For what?

754
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 According to the power source.

755
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 The lost King of Duyung's book is here.

756
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Duyung's book?

757
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Don't mess with my stuff.

758
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 What?

759
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Is it true?

760
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 Don't.

761
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 Professor Odebar.

762
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 I know who can do this.

763
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 It must be Panji.

764
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Don't you dare to talk back.

765
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Yes.

766
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Panji.

767
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Calm down.

768
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 We're sure that it's here.

769
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 But it's weird. Why can't we find it?

770
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 It means that only one thing.

771
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 The power source.

772
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 Alright. We'll go.

773
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 But we'll find our lost book.

774
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 I'll find it.

775
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 I must have Panji.

776
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 We're here.

777
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Gosh.

778
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 The queue is long.

779
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 Yes.

780
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 The queue is long.

781
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Yes.

782
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 It's okay.

783
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Come on.

784
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 Only the one who can make me happy.

785
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 The one I'm close to.

786
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 What?

787
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 What's wrong?

788
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 I miss you.

789
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 What are you looking at?

790
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 I'm looking for the lost book.

791
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 I must find it.

792
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 Who knows the book is in him.

793
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 "The lost book"

794
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 It's here.

795
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 It's here.

796
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Bargi will always wait for Panji.

797
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 "The lost book"

798
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 It turns out that you're handsome.

799
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 You have a monster's taste.

800
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Cing!

801
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 You're always taking people's stuff.

802
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 I'm warning you.

803
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Don't ever touch my stuff.

804
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Why?

805
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Are you afraid that I'll take your beloved monster?

806
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 I'll take your mouth.

807
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 Feel it.

808
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 You're so big.

809
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 I'll eat you.

810
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Move.

811
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Move.

812
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Move.

813
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Move.

814
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 It turns out that you're handsome.

815
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 What's wrong?

816
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Hang on.

817
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 What are you doing?

818
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 I'm looking for the lost book.

819
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 "The lost book"

820
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 It's here.

821
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 It's not here.

822
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Angkara, let us go.

823
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 Angkara, let us go.

824
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 Angkara.

825
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 Let me be happy first.

826
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 Then, I'll do whatever you want.

827
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 Okay.

828
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 I'll do it.

829
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 In the past, there was a princess...

830
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 ...who was ugly.

831
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 No.

832
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 I don't want to tell the story of a princess...

833
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 ...who was far away from her lover.

834
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 I want to tell the story of a princess who was far away from her lover.

835
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 I'm bored, Mbak Mbirbi.

836
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 I know how to do it.

837
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 Get the tarot card.

838
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 What's wrong with you?

839
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 You're so rude.

840
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 I don't want to be rude to you.

841
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Don't be rude.

842
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 It's hard to be with her.

843
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 I don't want to do anything.

844
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 I think I know her.

845
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 What's wrong with you?

846
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 To be continued...

847
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 To be continued...

848
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 To be continued...

849
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 To be continued...

850
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 To be continued...

851
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 To be continued...

852
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 To be continued...

853
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 To be continued...

854
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 To be continued...

855
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 ...one in a million.

856
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 So, if someone needs help, there's only one condition.

857
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 Dance in front of him.

858
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Alva.

859
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 I know how to make him happy.

860
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 You have to dance in front of him.

861
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 Dangdut?

862
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 Yes, Dangdut.

863
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 I know him, Alva.

864
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 He's my teacher.

865
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 Madam, can you give me another chance?

866
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 We'll think about how to make you happy.

867
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 Okay.

868
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 One more time.

869
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 Okay, let's go out.

870
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 Madam, we'll go out first.

871
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 Let's go.

872
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 I know you like Dangdut song.

873
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 Huh? Dangdut?

874
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 That's why we have to practice it first.

875
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 I don't know how to make him happy.

876
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 Do you know where it's from?

877
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Did you read it from a book?

878
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 I don't think so.

879
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 If we make a mistake, he might get angry.

880
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 And he won't practice it.

881
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 That's impossible.

882
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 I'm sure someone will tell me that he likes Dangdut.

883
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 That's why we have to dance in front of him.

884
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 I want to go home.

885
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 To be continued...

886
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 We can do this!

887
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 To be continued...

888
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 We can do this!

889
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 Can you do it?

890
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 Shut up!

891
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 Don't follow me!

892
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 You're following me!

893
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 That's it.

894
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 What?

895
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 If you keep doing this, we'll never pass.

896
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 Yes, that's right.

897
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 Then, what should we do?

898
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 How about this?

899
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 Hurry up.

900
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 Bite this rope until it's loose.

901
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Why do I have to bite this rope?

902
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 This is so complicated.

903
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 I have an idea.

904
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 So, I'll be the first one to do it.

905
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 Hurry up.

906
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 Just do it.

907
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 When I'm free, I'll let you do it.

908
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 Come on.

909
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 Okay.

910
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 Hurry up.

911
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 Don't move.

912
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 What the heck?

913
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 You did that on purpose, didn't you?

914
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 I'm sorry.

915
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 I can't control myself.

916
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 I had to throw it.

917
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 Hurry up.

918
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 Let go of this.

919
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 It's still smelly.

920
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 Just blow it.

921
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 Let the smell go.

922
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 Hurry up.

923
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 You're so slow.

924
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 Don't move.

925
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 Don't ever touch my stuff again.

926
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 Remember that.

927
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 Okay.

928
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 By the way, we have to do it properly.

929
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 I'm afraid that we'll be chased.

930
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 Yes.

931
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 Luckily, you're not in danger.

932
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 What?

933
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 My rope.

934
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 Hurry up.

935
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 Don't touch it.

936
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 No.

937
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 Come on.

938
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 Let's go.

939
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 I'll go first.

940
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 Okay.

941
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 Sir.

942
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 Wait.

943
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Wait for a minute.

944
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 Okay.

945
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 Wait.

946
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 What's wrong?

947
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 It's neat.

948
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 Be patient.

 I'm very smart.

960
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 Now, I just have to follow them...

961
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000

 You're smart.

965
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 But, how do you dance?

966
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000

 We'll tell him, "What are you doing?"

1016
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 So, you're accusing me?

1017

 And this is against me?

1018

 Don't use me in all kinds of ways.

 I'm a coward.

 Coward?

 So, our movement will be better.

00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000

 Who's that?

1027
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 Hello, everyone.

1028
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 Who are you?

1029
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 I saw you from there.

1030
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 You're practicing dancing, right?

1031
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 It's good, but it's not compact enough.

1032
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
 How about I help you practice...

1033
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 ...dancing together, but it has to be compact.

1034
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
 Really?

1035
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
 But, you won't pay me, right?

1036
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 Of course not.

1037
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 Just relax.

1038
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 It's all free.

1039
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 Yes!

01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000

 Bye.

1045
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 I hope they'll be challenged by Professor Aldebaran...

1046
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 ...so that they'll be expelled from this school.

1047
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 We can do it.

1048
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 We can do it.

 long hair, white skin

1144
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:55,980
 and the woman is here

01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,980
 where?

1146
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,980
 you're lying

1147
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,980
 she's our friend

1148
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:07,980
 the crystal ball is not a lie

 the woman is here

1150
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,980

 we don't understand

1152
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,980
 it's a bad omen

1153
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,980
 you're talking nonsense

1154
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,980
 Madam never make a mistake

1155
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:30,980
 and all of her prophecy is not wrong

01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,980
 you're the one who make a mistake

1158
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,980

 you dare to Madam

1160
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:45,980
 what Madam Gemini meant is me

1161
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:49,980
 but how can I use the crystal ball?

1162
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:53,980
 because I haven't seen them for a long time

1163
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,980

 get down

1169
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:19,980
 Madam Gemini said that the crystal ball is in a woman's hand

1170
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:20,980
 what do you mean?

 I don't like you

1173
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,980
 you're making a hypothesis
