00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 To be continued...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 To be continued...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 To be continued...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 To be continued...

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 To be continued...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, run with courage

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 You are more important than my hair

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I'm willing to give my hair to you

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So, you want to give your hair to me?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 That's a loud thunder, Ci

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Don't let something bad take over you

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Don't be afraid, I'm here

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I'm here

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Now, you better be Agni first

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Agni who died last in this school

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Open your mouth

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Agni, wake up

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I managed to catch all of them, sir

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Including Agni

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And I've tied them up very tightly, sir

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So, they won't be able to get out of here

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And there will be many new students joining you, sir

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 You've learned teleportation, right?

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 They've learned it

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But, they can't do it

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Right?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Professor Purwa, it's not wrong to try it now, right?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Idea

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 How do we do it, sir?

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 We tie them up

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We tie them up

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 But, we can't do it, sir

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 What?

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Don't talk nonsense

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Now, everyone

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Take the torch, come on

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Oh, I forgot

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Why don't I use my magical power?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Wind

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 It's because of you

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I forgot

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Wind, come to me

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Take the torch

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Wind, come to me

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 You're great, Leon

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You're smarter than...

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 You know me, right?

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I'm...

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 The Great...

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Tali

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Everyone

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 We'll use teleportation

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 In three counts

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 One

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Let's go, sir

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Two

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Three

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Teleportation

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Where are they?

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Where are they?

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 This must be your mistake

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 You tied them up

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But, you didn't take the torch, right?

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Oh, yes, sir

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I'm sorry, sir

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I forgot, sir

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 You idiot

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You have to accept my power

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I'm sorry, sir

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I'm sorry, sir

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 We're safe

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Finally, we're free from the trap

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Yes, my teleportation is successful

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I miss this school so much

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Agni, you've been leaving the magic school for days

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And what you did there

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Because you have a dark side

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 What?

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I mean, you're taking care of the dark side of Pangeran's hair

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 No, I'm not

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Finally, sir

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Finally, it's clean

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 There's nothing left of Pangeran's dark side

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That's what you should do for the first time

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 We're here

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Oh, yes, sir

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Where are Tommy, Mike, and Jack?

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I was just about to ask them that

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Why did we teleport to the magic school?

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Maybe it's a bad omen, sir

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Where are they?

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I'm so scared

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 What?

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Why are you so annoying?

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Sir, help me

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Yes, sir

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Ouch, my hand is slippery

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 What did we call it?

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Teleportation

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Is that right?

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yes, that's right

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 If it's true, we can't go here

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Then, what should we do?

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Let's teleport back

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So, we go back to Kastilah, to Pangeran, and to Gapun?

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Let's do that, instead of being a puppet here

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Let's do that

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Get ready, everyone

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Teleport

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Get ready, sir

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Don't, sir

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Ball, ball

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 They're here, sir

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Good, good

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 You're a good student

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 They don't want to

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Just finish them

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Yes, sir

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Let's teleport

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Oh, no, sir

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Oh, no, sir

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Don't kill us

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 We're the guardians, sir

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 We're the guardians

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Right?

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Seriously?

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Seriously, sir

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 You all must be loyal

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 If you're not loyal,

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I won't hesitate to give you a severe punishment

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 What?

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Yes, sir

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 We won't betray you, sir

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Promise?

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Promise

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Promise

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Good

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 My husband

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 He's awake

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Bargi, thank God you're here

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Now, it's time for us to go

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Let's go

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 My husband

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 What is it, Bargi?

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Your hair is so smooth

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 No, I said no

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Bargi, don't be silly, okay?

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 You can't

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Poor him

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Just hold his hair

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Yes, sir

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Right?

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 We got his hair because of you

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Yes, that's right

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Yes, yes

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Go, sweetie

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Yes, yes

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Yes, yes

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Yes, yes, yes

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Come here

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 My husband

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 My husband

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 My husband

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Come here

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You're so slow

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Run, sir

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Run, sir

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Sir, help me

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Sir

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Now

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 You're the one who's going to die

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Come here

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Hold on

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Hurry up

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Hurry up

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 You must remember

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 If you dare to betray

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Then the mark on your hand

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Will turn into poison

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 That will attack you from the inside

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 What should we do?

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 The first task for you

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Be careful, Alva

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 If Alva gets the soul stone

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 You must snatch it

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 You must protect the soul stone

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Don't let Alva destroy it

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Do you understand?

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Yes, sir

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Where's the professor?

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He's gone

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 You managed to bring Agni home

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Good

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I'm sure you can do it

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Agni

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Welcome back to Siheung School

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Thank you, professor

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 We both have

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 A little problem

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Problem?

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 What problem?

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Here's the thing, professor

217
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Tommy, Mike, and Jake

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Are not back to school yet

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Yes

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 When we were memorizing the teleportation mantra

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 The kids are wrong

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 They're lost

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It's all my fault

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I gave them permission

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 But today

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 There's a report

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And a report from the police

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And a meeting between the parents and the students

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 The kids?

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Thank God

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 They're here

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Tommy, Mike, Jake

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Where are you from?

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 We were wrong about the teleportation mantra, professor

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So

237
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 We're heading to Paris

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 That's great

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 The view is so beautiful

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 It's not bad, professor

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 We can go around the world for free

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Yes, professor

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 We'll go to the engine

244
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And then we'll see the pyramids

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 You guys just go ahead

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 We're all worried about you

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Sorry, professor

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It's okay

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 What's important now

250
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 You can go back safely

251
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Thank God, we didn't know

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I want to tell you a secret

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 To me and the kids

254
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Because

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I've already considered you all as my siblings

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 What's the secret?

257
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Yes

258
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Actually

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I'm a pretty girl

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 But I was cursed by the evil sorcerer

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Really?

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Are you sure?

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 It's hard to imagine you being a pretty girl

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 That's impossible

265
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I'm just like that

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 How can I be a girl?

267
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 That's right

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 How can I be a pretty girl?

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 If you kiss me 12 times

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And get married

271
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Then

272
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 You'll be a girl again

273

274
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 I know

275
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 This is one of your tricks

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So I'll marry you

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 If you talk like that

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Enough

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Let's go home

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Listen, Bargi

281
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 To get married

282
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 You have to have love

283
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Do you understand?

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Come on, Om

285
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Just marry me

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Kiss me 12 times

287
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Then you'll be a girl

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I think that's right

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000

 At 6 PM

293
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Because there's an announcement

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 About the parents' visit tomorrow

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 To get the papers

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 It's 5 PM

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 What should we do?

298
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Let's go back to school

 Oh my God, Bargi

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I told you

308
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 To get married

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 You have to have love

310

 You're angry

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 You're angry too

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 But

328
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Bargi can definitely

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Overcome me

 I'm also pretty outside

 If you don't believe me

 Kiss me

 (Music)

606
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,180
 Alva, we have to be very careful.

607
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,180
 Don't let anyone know that your parents are still alive.

608
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:00,180
 (Music)

609
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,180

611
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,180
 (Music)

612
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,180
 Mother, don't leave me again, mother.

613
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,180
 Thank you for your kindness.

614
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,180
 I will never leave you, son.

615
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:31,180
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

616
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,180
 You're a grown up now.

617
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,180
 I miss you, Alva.

618
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,180
 (Music)

619
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,180
 I love you, I miss you, honey.

620
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:57,180
 (Music)

621
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,180
 But mother, how can I wake up?

622
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,180
 I haven't got my eighth birthday present.

623
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:12,180
 (Music)

624
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,180
 I don't know, son.

625
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,180
 I'm confused too.

626
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,180
 This morning, I suddenly opened my eyes.

627
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,180
 I can wake up.

628
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:34,180
 (Music)

629
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
 I can wake up.

630
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,180
 I can wake up.

631
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,180
 (Music)

632
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,180
 Gama.

633
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,180
 Gama, wake up, Gama.

634
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:56,180
 (Music)

635
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,180
 Are these curses over?

636
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:07,180
 (Music)

637
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,180
 Gama.

638
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,180
 Gama.

639
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
 Gama, wake up.

640
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:20,180
 Gama, wake up.

641
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,180
 Why don't you wake up?

642
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:39,180
 (Music)

643
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,180
 Panji.

644
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
 Panji.

645
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,180
 (Music)

646
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,180
 Panji.

647
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,180
 Panji.

648
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,180
 (Music)

649
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
 Panji.

650
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
 (Music)

651
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
 Where is he?

652
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,180
 (Music)

653
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,180
 Panji.

654
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,180
 Panji.

655
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,180
 (Music)

656
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,180
 Where is Panji?

657
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,180
 He's not in his room.

658
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:22,180
 (Music)

659
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,180
 Magic school?

660
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
 (Music)

661
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
 This must be Alfa's school.

662
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,180
 (Music)

663
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,180
 But now I'm here, son.

664
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
 I'm with Alfa.

665
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
 Yes, mother.

666
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
 This is the magic.

667
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,180
 Maybe God gave a gift for us.

668
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
 Yes, dear.

669
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
 A gift for us.

670
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
 Yes, son.

671
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:56,180
 (Music)

672
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,180
 I love you, Alfa.

673
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,180
 I love you too, mother.

674
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:11,180
 (Music)

675
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
 Oh, Alfa.

676
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,180
 I have a gift for you.

677
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
 What is it?

678
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:32,180
 (Music)

679
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,180
 It's so cool, mother.

680
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,180
 This is a very special watch, Alfa.

681
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,180
 If you turn the needle forward...

682
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:46,180
 ...you can advance the time as much as you turn.

683
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,180
 If you turn the needle backward...

684
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,180
 ...you can turn back time.

685
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
 If you turn off the clock...

686
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,180
 ...you can stop time.

687
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,180
 Keep this watch carefully, Alfa.

688
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
 You have to remember...

689
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,180
 ...you can only use all of its functions once.

690
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
 So you have to be careful.

691
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,180
 You have to think carefully...

692
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:15,180
 ...and consider carefully before you use this watch.

693
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
 Thank you, mother.

694
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,180
 I'm sure you'll need this watch one day.

695
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:33,180
 (Music)

696
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,180
 Who's that, Alfa?

697
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
 It's a girl.

698
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
 A girl?

699
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,180
 Maybe her father.

700
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,180
 Let's just keep an eye on her.

701
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
 Let's follow her.

702
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,180
 But don't let her get her soul mate.

703
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,180
 Okay.

704
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:56,180
 (Screaming)

705
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,180
 Where are you going?

706
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,180
 Why are you following her?

707
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,180
 You want to run away because of your bad temper?

708
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,180
 Right?

709
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,180
 Where are you going?

710
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,180
 It's so hard to be a child.

711
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,180
 You're all red-handed.

712
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,180
 (Screaming)

713
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
 It hurts.

714
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
 It hurts, sir.

715
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,180
 Let's go.

716
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:25,180
 (Music)

717
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,180
 Where are you going?

718
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,180
 I'm going to the bathroom.

719
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
 You can go first.

720
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,180
 Let's go.

721
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,180
 (Music)

722
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,180
 (Screaming)

723
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,180
 What's wrong with you?

724
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,180
 Why are you running away?

725
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,180
 Mom.

726
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,180
 Mom, I'm scared.

727
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,180
 I'm going to the bathroom.

728
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
 I'm going to the bathroom.

729
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
 Wait, I want to ask you something.

730
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,180
 Did you see Alfa?

731
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,180
 No, she's in the back room.

732
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
 I'm going to find out who she is.

733
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:08,180
 (Music)

734
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:20,180
 (Music)

735
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,180
 Mom.

736
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,180
 Can you introduce my friends?

737
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,180
 Sure.

738
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:36,180
 (Music)

739
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,180
 Hello, Panji.

740
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,180
 (Music)

741
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
 Wilan.

742
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,180
 You...

743
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,180
 How did you get here?

744
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,180
 I don't know.

745
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
 I'm confused too.

746
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,180
 This morning, I suddenly...

747
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,180
 I suddenly opened my eyes.

748
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,180
 But it was only me.

749
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,180
 Gama.

750
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,180
 I tried to wake him up, but he...

751
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,180
 He couldn't wake up until now.

752
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:21,180
 (Music)

753
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:31,180
 (Music)

754
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,180
 Om.

755
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,180
 Why do we have to hide?

756
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
 But...

757
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,180
 The sea is just a place for us to rest.

758
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,180
 Alfa.

759
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,180
 We have to be very careful.

760
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,180
 Don't let anyone know...

761
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,180
 If your parents are still alive.

762
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,180
 We have to keep this a secret.

763
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,180
 Very well.

764
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,180
 If it leaks to the dark side...

765
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,180
 It can be very dangerous.

766
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:02,180
 (Music)

767
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,180
 Okay, Alfa.

768
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,180
 Now, give me your Gaebkang Juba.

769
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
 Give it to your mother.

770
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,180
 Don't let anyone see it.

771
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,180
 Except Alfa.

772
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,180
 That Juba...

773
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
 I have it.

774
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,180
 Each of us has one.

775
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,180
 But Gama's had it...

776
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,180
 When he was borrowed...

777
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,180
 Oh, from Baran.

778
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,180
 I used it when I came here.

779
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,180
 So, that Gaebkang Juba...

780
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,180
 I want to get that magic Juba back.

781
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,180
 You don't have to, Alfa.

782
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,180
 That Juba is yours.

783
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,180
 No, Professor.

784
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,180
 It's not mine.

785
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,180
 It's someone else's.

786
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,180
 That Juba is not yours.

787
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,180
 But it's passed down to you.

788
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,180
 So, take good care of it.

789
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,180
 Yes.

790
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,180
 At that time, Baran said...

791
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,180
 That's my Gaebkang Juba.

792
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,180
 That means...

793
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,180
 It's from...

794
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,180
 Come on.

795
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,180
 Okay.

796
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,180
 Let's not waste time.

797
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,180
 Now...

798
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,180
 Let's go to Aldo and ask him about this.

799
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,180
 Why did I take the stardard back?

800
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,180
 Let's go.

801
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,180
 Alfa and the girl.

802
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,180
 I think it's her mother.

803
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,180
 Alfa's mother?

804
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:21,180
 We can do it.

805
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:26,180
 We can do it.

806
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,180
 We can do it.

807
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,180
 Where are we going?

808
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,180
 I don't know.

809
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:43,180
 Did you see Alfa?

810
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,180
 No.

811
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,180
 I looked for her in the warehouse.

812
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,180
 Did you see her?

813
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,180
 I looked for her too.

814
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,180
 But I can't find her.

815
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,180
 Where is she?

816
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,180
 Maybe she's sad again.

817
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,180
 Because we're busy with our parents.

818
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:01,180
 I'm so angry.

819
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,180
 Let's find Alfa.

820
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,180
 Let's go.

821
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,180
 Where are you going?

822
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,180
 You can ask me.

823
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,180
 We're going to the professor's room.

824
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:19,180
 Why are we going to the professor's room?

825
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,180
 It's none of your business.

826
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,180
 It's none of my business.

827
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,180
 I'm not going to the professor's room.

828
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,180
 I'm going to the professor's room.

829
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,180
 I'm going to the professor's room.

830
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,180
 I'm going to the professor's room.

831
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,180
 I'm going to the professor's room.

832
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,180
 I'm going to the professor's room.

833
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,180
 Purwa.

834
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,180
 It's none of your business.

835
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,180
 Do you understand?

836
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,180
 Let's go, Alfa.

837
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,180
 Mom.

838
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,180
 Akira.

839
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:56,180
 You're too much.

840
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:01,180
 Hello, Purwa.

841
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,180
 No way.

842
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,180
 You're dead.

843
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,180
 I saw it.

844
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:17,180
 You know this.

845
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,180
 If the Dark Lord finds out that I'm still alive...

846
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,180
 ...it will be very dangerous.

847
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,180
 Okay.

848
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,180
 Let's go.

849
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,180
 "The Dark Lord"

850
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:42,180
 Excuse me, sir.

851
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,180
 Are you Jack's teacher?

852
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,180
 It's a pleasure to meet you.

853
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,180
 I'm Roga.

854
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,180
 Jack's daughter.

855
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,180
 Where are you going?

856
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,180
 Excuse me, sir. I'm going to get my son.

857
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,180
 Peace be upon you.

858
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,180
 I'm so lucky.

859
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,180
 Come on.

860
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,180
 So, you've been hiding Gama and Aquila all this time?

861
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,180
 Yes.

862
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,180
 Where is Gama now?

863
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,180
 Why is he gone?

864
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,180
 Gama is unconscious.

865
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,180
 I've tried to wake him up.

866
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,180
 But he's still unconscious.

867
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,180
 I'm also wondering...

868
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,180
 ...why Aquila is conscious again.

869
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,180
 Because as far as I know...

870
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,180
 ...Gama and Aquila can be conscious...

871
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,180
 ...if their hands are smeared with the Dark Lord's blood.

872
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,180
 That's what I know.

873
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:49,180
 But I don't have any blood on my hands.

874
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,180
 Can you guess what happened?

875
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,180
 Aquila.

876
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,180
 Do you feel anything strange about yourself?

877
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,180
 This ring.

878
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,180
 I think I know...

879
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,180
 ...what gives you the power to do everything.

880
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,180
 The ring you're wearing...

881
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,180
 ...is made of the Sun Stone.

882
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,180
 The only stone in the world...

883
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,180
 ...that has the same energy as the Sun.

884
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,180
 That stone must be the one that gives you the power to do everything.

885
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,180
 What if I wear that ring forever?

886
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,180
 You'll still be alive.

887
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,180
 I don't know yet.

888
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,180
 But Aquila.

889
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:58,180
 Where did you get that ring?

890
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:04,180
 I don't remember. I don't know.

891
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:09,180
 I just realized that I'm wearing the ring.

892
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,180
 I don't care where you got that ring.

893
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:17,180
 What matters is that you can come back to life.

894
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,180
 Let me see.

895
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:33,180
 Why did you take the ring from the ring?

896
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,180
 I don't know.

897
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,180
 Why is the black color of the ring...

898
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,180
 ...the same as the skin of a pig's hair?

899
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,180
 Alva.

900
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,180
 What's wrong?

901
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,180
 Nothing, Sir.

902
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,180
 Nothing.

903
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,180
 Nothing.

904
00:52:52,180 --> 00:53:11,180
 I'm so tired of being a daily job.

905
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,180
 Me too.

906
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,180
 Don't bother us.

907
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,180
 We have to concentrate.

908
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,180
 Don't make us make a mistake again.

909
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,180
 One.

910
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,180
 Two.

911
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
 Three.

912
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,180
 Teleportation.

913
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,180
 Any report today?

914
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,180
 Alva hasn't found the soul stone yet, Sir.

915
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,180
 That's all?

916
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,180
 There's more.

917
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:45,180
 When we took the report, there was Alva and a woman.

918
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,180
 I think it's her mother.

919
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,180
 Yes, it's her mother.

920
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,180
 Alva's mother?

921
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,180
 Yes, Sir.

922
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:02,180
 Is it true that there's a soul stone in this ring?

923
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,180
 No, it's impossible.

924
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,180
 That's impossible.

925
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,180
 Wait.

926
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,180
 I think it's safe.

927
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,180
 Akhila, you can open it.

928
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,180
 Let's see.

929
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:29,180
 Akhila.

930
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,180
 What are you going to do tonight?

931
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,180
 I'm going home.

932
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,180
 I feel sorry for Gamma.

933
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,180
 Don't.

934
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,180
 My house is far away.

935
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,180
 You'd better stay here tonight.

936
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,180
 Because Alva will miss you.

937
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,180
 Right, Alva?

938
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,180
 Yes, I miss my mother too.

939
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,180
 Alva.

940
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,180
 If your mother lives here, where do you want to stay?

941
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,180
 In my apartment.

942
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,180
 I have an apartment.

943
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,180
 We'd better go home.

944
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,180
 In my apartment.

945
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,180
 You'd better stay in my house.

946
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,180
 In my apartment.

947
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,180
 I said, in my apartment.

948
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,180
 My house.

949
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,180
 You don't understand.

950
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,180
 I said, in my apartment.

951
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,180
 I said, in my house.

952
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
 My apartment.

953
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,180
 In my house.

954
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,180
 My apartment.

955
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,180
 In my house.

956
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,180
 Shh.

957
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,180
 It's okay.

958
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,180
 [Akhila is going to stay in Gamma's house tonight.]

959
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,180
 Sir.

960
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,180
 Yes.

961
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:45,180
 Can I stay in your apartment tonight?

962
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,180
 Sure.

963
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:53,180
 Of course.

964
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,180
 But there's a condition.

965
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,180
 What's that?

966
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,180
 I'll do anything you want.

967
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,180
 Anything?

968
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,180
 Anything.

969
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,180
 Okay.

970
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:12,180
 I want you to stay in your house tonight.

971
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:18,180
 Alva.

972
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,180
 Yes.

973
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,180
 I agree.

974
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,180
 That's a great idea.

975
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,180
 No.

976
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,180
 That's not a great idea.

977
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,180
 Because...

978
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,180
 Alva.

979
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,180
 Alva has to sleep in the dormitory.

980
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,180
 That's the rule.

981
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,180
 And...

982
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,180
 And that's the rule.

983
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,180
 No.

984
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,180
 The rule can be broken.

985
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,180
 I'll take care of it.

986
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,180
 No.

987
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,180
 That's the rule.

988
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,180
 It's written.

989
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,180
 No.

990
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,180
 I'll ask for permission.

991
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,180
 I'll ask for permission from Professor Aldebaran.

992
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,180
 To let Alva stay in the dormitory.

993
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,180
 No.

994
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,180
 Professor Aldebaran will never allow it.

995
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,180
 He will.

996
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,180
 He will.

997
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,180
 He will.

998
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,180
 He will.

999
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,180
 He will.

1000
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,180
 Stop.

1001
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,180
 Shh.

1002
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:14,180
 Purwa.

1003
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,180
 I still miss Alva.

1004
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,180
 What's the condition?

1005
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,180
 I'm fine.

1006
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,180
 Okay.

1007
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,180
 You can all stay in my dormitory.

1008
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:31,180
 Okay.

1009
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,180
 Let's go.

1010
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,180
 Let's go, Alva.

1011
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,180
 Let's go.

1012
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:41,180
 I've found...

1013
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,180
 ...the third soul stone.

1014
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,180
 Where is it, Prof?

1015
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,180
 Where is it?

1016
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,180
 Where is it, Prof?

1017
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
 Where is it?

1018
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:53,180
 To be continued...

1019
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:58,180
 To be continued...

1020
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,180
 To be continued...

1021
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:10,180
 Both of Alva's parents are gone.

1022
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,180
 Why?

1023
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,180
 They died.

1024
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,180
 Don't lie.

1025
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,180
 If you lie, I won't let you go.

1026
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,180
 Do you want that?

1027
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,180
 Yes, Sir.

1028
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,180
 We're not lying.

1029
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,180
 It's true.

1030
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,180
 Enough.

1031
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,180
 Now, investigate and watch Alva.

1032
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,180
 Hurry.

1033
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
 Yes, Sir.

1034
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,180
 Teleportation.

1035
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,180
 Please.

1036
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,180
 Please come in.

1037
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,180
 This is my house.

1038
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,180
 It's a nice house.

1039
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,180
 It's clean and neat.

1040
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,180
 Yes, Sir.

1041
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,180
 It's nice.

1042
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,180
 Thank you.

1043
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,180
 Sir, are you okay?

1044
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,180
 I'm fine.

1045
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,180
 I'll take care of it later.

1046
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,180
 Oh, right.

1047
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,180
 Akhila.

1048
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,180
 Your room is over there with Alva.

1049
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,180
 Okay.

1050
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,180
 We'll take a rest.

1051
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,180
 Yes, Sir.

1052
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,180
 Be careful.

1053
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,180
 Be careful.

1054
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:22,180
 Don't be so sad.

1055
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,180
 Remember.

1056
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,180
 She's my wife.

1057
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:31,180
 Get in.

1058
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,180
 Come.

1059
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:46,180
 Where is Alva?

1060
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,180
 She doesn't come back.

1061
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,180
 Where is she?

1062
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,180
 She's gone.

1063
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,180
 Wait.

1064
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,180
 Don't tell me.

1065
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,180
 Alva...

1066
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,180
 ...was kidnapped by the Dark Lord.

1067
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,180
 Oh, no.

1068
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,180
 Don't say that, Plita.

1069
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,180
 Let's do this.

1070
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,180
 We'll wait until tomorrow.

1071
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:20,180
 If Alva doesn't come tomorrow, we'll report to the Professor.

1072
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,180
 Do you agree?

1073
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,180
 I agree.

1074
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:30,180
 Then, a kind-hearted warrior came to save the princess.

1075
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,180
 He fought the evil Dark Lord with his sword.

1076
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,180
 Shoot.

1077
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:43,180
 And he finally saved the princess he loved.

1078
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:50,180
 Alva.

1079
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,180
 Why are you crying?

1080
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,180
 I'm sorry.

1081
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:02,180
 I still can't believe...

1082
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:06,180
 ...that you're in front of me.

1083
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:10,180
 But I'm happy.

1084
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,180
 I'm so happy.

1085
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,180
 I'll try to stop time.

1086
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,180
 I'll always be with you.

1087
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,180
 Be patient, honey.

1088
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,180
 Your father and I will try to do that.

1089
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:32,180
 Mom.

1090
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:37,180
 When can I meet my friends?

1091
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:40,180
 Not yet, Alva.

1092
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,180
 But even though you don't know your friends yet...

1093
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:50,180
 ...I'm sure they're good friends for you.

1094
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:54,180
 Yes, Mom. They're very good friends.

1095
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:58,180
 Mom.

1096
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,180
 (Alva's room)

1097
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,180
 (Alva's room)

1098
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,180
 (Alva's room)

1099
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:35,180
 The Fatang Blaster.

1100
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,180
 This is better.

1101
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,180
 It's time to sleep.

1102
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:44,180
 It's safe.

1103
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:59,180
 I can't sleep.

1104
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:03,180
 I was going to sleep on my head, but now I'm sleeping on my feet.

1105
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,180
 I'll remember this.

1106
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,180
 I'll wake up and everything will be fine.

1107
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,180
 I won't give up.

1108
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,180
 (Alva's room)

1109
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:36,180
 Panji.

1110
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,180
 This must be you.

1111
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,180
 Open it.

1112
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,180
 I'm sorry, Sir.

1113
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:48,180
 You'll be a ghost when you sleep.

1114
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,180
 You're a ghost.

1115
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,180
 I'll make you pay.

1116
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,180
 Good morning, Sir.

1117
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,180
 Alva.

1118
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,180
 What are you doing?

1119
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,180
 We were exercising.

1120
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,180
 A little exercise.

1121
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,180
 To start the Fatang Blaster.

1122
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,180
 Please enjoy this.

1123
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:18,180
 I'll pour you a drink.

1124
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:33,180
 Sir.

1125
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,180
 Here.

1126
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:55,180
 Sir.

1127
01:04:55,180 --> 01:05:02,180
 It's okay.

1128
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,180
 (Alva's room)

1129
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:15,180
 I want an egg.

1130
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:20,180
 Why are you so angry?

1131
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,180
 You're so annoying.

1132
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:27,180
 You can't make a noise when you eat.

1133
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,180
 Eat properly.

1134
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,180
 (Alva's room)

1135
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:38,180
 Kids, calm down.

1136
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,180
 Alva is in a safe place.

1137
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,180
 Where is she?

1138
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,180
 Where is she?

1139
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,180
 Who knows? She's sad.

1140
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,180
 You're good friends.

1141
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,180
 You always think of your friends.

1142
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,180
 But Alva is not sad.

1143
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,180
 She's happy.

1144
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:04,180
 Why is she happy?

1145
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:09,180
 Calm down.

1146
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,180
 Alva is fine.

1147
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:15,180
 But there's something more important.

1148
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,180
 What is it, Sir?

1149
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,180
 I've found...

1150
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,180
 the third soul stone.

1151
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,180
 Where is it?

1152
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,180
 It's at Duyung.

1153
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:28,180
 Duyung?

1154
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,180
 Yes.

1155
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,180
 Duyung.

1156
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:36,180
 What is that?

1157
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,180
 Yes.

1158
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,180
 It's a sign of good news.

1159
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:43,180
 Alva is happy.

1160
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,180
 What is it?

1161
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,180
 Alva.

1162
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,180
 Alva, where are you?

1163
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,180
 We've been looking for you.

1164
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,180
 Yes.

1165
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,180
 We're worried about you.

1166
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,180
 We're worried that you'll be mad at us.

1167
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,180
 Mad?

1168
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,180
 Why should I be mad?

1169
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,180
 You didn't do anything wrong to me.

1170
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,180
 You're always mad at us.

1171
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,180
 Because we've been looking for you.

1172
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,180
 I really miss my dad.

1173
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,180
 Don't worry about him.

1174
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,180
 I'm sorry.

1175
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,180
 Yes.

1176
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,180
 I'm worried about my mom.

1177
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,180
 I didn't get to introduce her to you.

1178
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,180
 It's okay.

1179
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,180
 Relax.

1180
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,180
 I'm happy too.

1181
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:32,180
 You're happy?

1182
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:34,180
 What are you happy about?

1183
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,180
 You're happy that we're here?

1184
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,180
 You're happy that we're here?

1185
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,180
 Yes.

1186
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,180
 You're happy, right?

1187
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,180
 What's wrong?

1188
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,180
 I'll tell you later.

1189
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,180
 If there's a good time.

1190
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,180
 Okay.

1191
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:50,180
 Alva, I have good news.

1192
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:53,180
 We're going to the professor's room this morning.

1193
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,180
 He has a task for us.

1194
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,180
 What task?

1195
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,180
 We have to find the third soul stone.

1196
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:07,180
 Find the soul stone?

1197
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,180
 What does it mean?

1198
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,180
 The one in the hand is not the soul stone?

1199
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,180
 What?

1200
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,180
 The Duyo's book was stolen?

1201
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,180
 Yes.

1202
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,180
 And we don't know who did it.

1203
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,180
 That's weird.

1204
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,180
 Why is their book in the magic school?

1205
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,180
 Who did it?

1206
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:40,180
 I have to educate Alva again.

1207
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:43,180
 To find information about the soul stone.

1208
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:49,180
 To be continued...
