You are more important than my hair

15

I'm willing to give my hair to you

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, you want to give your hair to me?

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's a loud thunder, Ci

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't let something bad take over you

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid, I'm here

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm here

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now, you better be Agni first

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Agni who died last in this school

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Open your mouth

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Agni, wake up

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I managed to catch all of them, sir

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Including Agni

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I've tied them up very tightly, sir

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, they won't be able to get out of here

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And there will be many new students joining you, sir

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You've learned teleportation, right?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
They've learned it

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But, they can't do it

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Right?

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Professor Purwa, it's not wrong to try it now, right?

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Idea

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How do we do it, sir?

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We tie them up

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But, we can't do it, sir

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What?

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't talk nonsense

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, everyone

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Take the torch, come on

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, I forgot

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why don't I use my magical power?

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wind

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's because of you

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I forgot

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wind, come to me

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Take the torch

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wind, come to me

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're great, Leon

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're smarter than...

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You know me, right?

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm...

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The Great...

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Tali

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Everyone

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We'll use teleportation

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In three counts

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
One

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's go, sir

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Two

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Three

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Teleportation

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where are they?

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This must be your mistake

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You tied them up

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But, you didn't take the torch, right?

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, yes, sir

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry, sir

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I forgot, sir

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You idiot

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You have to accept my power

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry, sir

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We're safe

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Finally, we're free from the trap

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, my teleportation is successful

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I miss this school so much

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Agni, you've been leaving the magic school for days

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And what you did there

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because you have a dark side

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What?

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I mean, you're taking care of the dark side of Pangeran's hair

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, I'm not

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Finally, sir

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Finally, it's clean

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There's nothing left of Pangeran's dark side

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's what you should do for the first time

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We're here

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, yes, sir

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Where are Tommy, Mike, and Jack?

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was just about to ask them that

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why did we teleport to the magic school?

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Maybe it's a bad omen, sir

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Where are they?

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm so scared

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What?

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why are you so annoying?

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Sir, help me

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, sir

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ouch, my hand is slippery

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What did we call it?

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Teleportation

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is that right?

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, that's right

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If it's true, we can't go here

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then, what should we do?

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's teleport back

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So, we go back to Kastilah, to Pangeran, and to Gapun?

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's do that, instead of being a puppet here

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's do that

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Get ready, everyone

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Teleport

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Get ready, sir

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't, sir

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ball, ball

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They're here, sir

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Good, good

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're a good student

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They don't want to

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Just finish them

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, sir

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's teleport

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, no, sir

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't kill us

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We're the guardians, sir

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're the guardians

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right?

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Seriously?

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Seriously, sir

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You all must be loyal

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you're not loyal,

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I won't hesitate to give you a severe punishment

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes, sir

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We won't betray you, sir

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Promise?

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Promise

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Good

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My husband

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's awake

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Bargi, thank God you're here

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, it's time for us to go

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's go

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
My husband

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What is it, Bargi?

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Your hair is so smooth

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, I said no

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Bargi, don't be silly, okay?

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can't

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Poor him

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Just hold his hair

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes, sir

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right?

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We got his hair because of you

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes, that's right

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes, yes

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Go, sweetie

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, yes

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes, yes, yes

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Come here

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
My husband

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Come here

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're so slow

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Run, sir

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Sir, help me

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Sir

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're the one who's going to die

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Come here

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hold on

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hurry up

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You must remember

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If you dare to betray

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then the mark on your hand

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Will turn into poison

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That will attack you from the inside

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What should we do?

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The first task for you

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Be careful, Alfa

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If Alfa gets the soul stone

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You must snatch it

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You must protect the soul stone

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't let Alfa destroy it

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you understand?

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, sir

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Where's the professor?

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He's gone

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You managed to bring Agni home

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Good

Welcome back to Siheung School

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Thank you, professor

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We both have

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A little problem

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Problem?

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What problem?

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Here's the thing, professor

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tommy, Mike, and Jake

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes

205
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
When we were memorizing the teleportation mantra

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The kids are wrong

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
They're lost

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's all my fault

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I gave them permission

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But today

212

There's a report

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And a report from the police

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And a meeting between the parents and the students

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:52,000

Where are you from?

220

We were wrong about the teleportation mantra, professor

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000

It's not bad, professor

Yes, professor

228

229

I want to tell you a secret

238

To me and the kids

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Because

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I've already considered you all as my siblings

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I was cursed by the evil sorcerer

246

Really?

And get married

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Then

This is one of your tricks

So I'll marry you

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you talk like that

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000

How about this?

394
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What if I come to your school

395
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
To be your parent's representative?

396
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Seriously?

397
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yes, seriously

398
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Don't joke around

399
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000

How's it going?

404
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm not done yet

405
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Let me do it

406
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Wait

407
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You're using your fingers?

408
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You can do it with your mouth

409
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Work, work

410
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Guys, I'm going first

411
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000

Where are you going?

413

I'm in a hurry

414
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What's wrong?

415
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Why are you giving me a report?

416
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
My parents are nice

417
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll get scolded if I go in

418
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Why are you giving me a report?

419
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's so boring

420
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So you won't know

421
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If I'm naughty

422
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You'll get mad

423
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You're so naughty

424
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm just being nice

425
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because my parents are nice

426
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
What?

427
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm sad

428
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Because I can't joke around with my parents

429
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Rita, don't be sad

430
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We still have many friends

431
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And good teachers

432
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Just think of them as your parents

We can definitely do it

443

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
(Music)

585
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Where is he?

586
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,180
(Music)

587
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,180
Panji.

588
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,180
(Music)

589
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Where is Panji?

590
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,180
He's not in his room.

591
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:22,180
(Music)

592
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,180
Magic school?

593
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
(Music)

594
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
This must be Alfa's school.

595
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,180
(Music)

596
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,180
But now I'm here, son.

597
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
I'm with Alfa.

598
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Yes, mother.

599
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
This is the magic.

600
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Maybe God gave a gift for us.

601
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Yes, dear.

602
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
A gift for us.

603
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
Yes, son.

604
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:56,180
(Music)

605
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,180
I love you, Alfa.

606
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,180
I love you too, mother.

607
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:11,180
(Music)

608
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
Oh, Alfa.

609
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,180
I have a gift for you.

610
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
What is it?

611
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:32,180
(Music)

612
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,180
It's so cool, mother.

613
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,180
This is a very special watch, Alfa.

614
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,180
If you turn the needle forward...

615
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:46,180
...you can advance the time as much as you turn.

616
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,180
If you turn the needle backward...

617
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,180
...you can turn back time.

618
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
If you turn off the clock...

619
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,180
...you can stop time.

620
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Keep this watch carefully, Alfa.

621
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
You have to remember...

622
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,180
...you can only use all of its functions once.

623
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
So you have to be careful.

624
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,180
You have to think carefully...

625
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:15,180
...and consider carefully before you use this watch.

626
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
Thank you, mother.

627
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,180
I'm sure you'll need this watch one day.

628
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:33,180
(Music)

629
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,180
Who's that, Alfa?

630
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
It's a girl.

631
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
A girl?

632
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,180
Maybe her father.

633
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,180
Let's just keep an eye on her.

634
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
Let's follow her.

635
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,180
But don't let her get her soul mate.

636
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,180
Okay.

637
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:56,180
(Screaming)

638
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,180
Where are you going?

639
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,180
Why are you following her?

640
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,180
You want to run away because of your bad temper?

641
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,180
Right?

642
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,180
Where are you going?

643
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,180
It's so hard to be a child.

644
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,180
You're all red-handed.

645
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,180
(Screaming)

646
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
It hurts.

647
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
It hurts, sir.

648
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,180
Let's go.

649
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:25,180
(Music)

650
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,180
Where are you going?

651
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,180
I'm going to the bathroom.

652
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
You can go first.

653
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,180
Let's go.

654
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,180
(Music)

655
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,180
(Screaming)

656
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,180
What's wrong with you?

657
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Why are you running away?

658
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,180
Mom.

659
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,180
Mom, I'm scared.

660
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,180
I'm going to the bathroom.

661
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Wait, I want to ask you something.

662
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,180
Did you see Alfa?

663
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,180
No, she's in the back room.

664
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,180
I'm going to find out who she is.

665
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:20,180
(Music)

666
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,180
Mom.

667
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,180
Can you introduce my friends?

668
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,180
Sure.

669
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:36,180
(Music)

670
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,180
Hello, Panji.

671
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,180
(Music)

672
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
Wilan.

673
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,180
You...

674
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,180
How did you get here?

675
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,180
I don't know.

676
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
I'm confused too.

677
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,180
This morning, I suddenly...

678
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,180
I suddenly opened my eyes.

679
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,180
But it was only me.

680
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,180
Gama.

681
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,180
I tried to wake him up, but he...

682
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,180
He couldn't wake up until now.

683
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:31,180
(Music)

684
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,180
Om.

685
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,180
Why do we have to hide?

686
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
But...

687
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,180
The sea is just a place for us to rest.

688
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,180
Alfa.

689
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,180
We have to be very careful.

690
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,180
Don't let anyone know...

691
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,180
If your parents are still alive.

692
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,180
We have to keep this a secret.

693
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,180
Very well.

694
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,180
If it leaks to the dark side...

695
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,180
It can be very dangerous.

696
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:02,180
(Music)

697
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,180
Okay, Alfa.

698
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,180
Now, give me your Gaebkang Juba.

699
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
Give it to your mother.

700
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,180
Don't let anyone see it.

701
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,180
Except Alfa.

702
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,180
That Juba...

703
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
I have it.

704
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,180
Each of us has one.

705
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,180
But Gama's had it...

706
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,180
When he was borrowed...

707
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,180
Oh, from Baran.

708
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,180
I used it when I came here.

709
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,180
So, that Gaebkang Juba...

710
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,180
I want to get that magic Juba back.

711
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,180
You don't have to, Alfa.

712
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,180
That Juba is yours.

713
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,180
No, Professor.

714
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,180
It's not mine.

715
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,180
It's someone else's.

716
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,180
That Juba is not yours.

717
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,180
But it's passed down to you.

718
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,180
So, take good care of it.

719
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,180
Yes.

720
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,180
At that time, Baran said...

721
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,180
That's my Gaebkang Juba.

722
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,180
That means...

723
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,180
It's from...

724
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,180
Come on.

725
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,180
Okay.

726
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,180
Let's not waste time.

727
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,180
Now...

728
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,180
Let's go to Aldo and ask him about this.

729
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,180
Why did I take the stardard back?

730
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,180
Let's go.

731
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,180
Alfa and the girl.

732
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,180
I think it's her mother.

733
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,180
Alfa's mother?

734
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:31,180
We can do it.

735
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,180
Where are we going?

736
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,180
I don't know.

737
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:43,180
Did you see Alfa?

738
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,180
No.

739
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,180
I looked for her in the warehouse.

740
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,180
Did you see her?

741
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,180
I looked for her too.

742
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,180
But I can't find her.

743
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,180
Where is she?

744
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,180
Maybe she's sad again.

745
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,180
Because we're busy with our parents.

746
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:01,180
I'm so angry.

747
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,180
Let's find Alfa.

748
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,180
Let's go.

749
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,180
Where are you going?

750
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,180
You can ask me.

751
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,180
We're going to the professor's room.

752
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:19,180
Why are we going to the professor's room?

753
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,180
It's none of your business.

754
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,180
It's none of my business.

755
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,180
I'm not going to the professor's room.

756
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:35,180
I'm going to the professor's room.

757
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,180
Purwa.

758
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,180
It's none of your business.

759
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,180
Do you understand?

760
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,180
Let's go, Alfa.

761
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,180
Mom.

762
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,180
Akira.

763
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:56,180
You're too much.

764
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:01,180
Hello, Purwa.

765
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,180
No way.

766
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,180
You're dead.

767
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,180
I saw it.

768
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:17,180
You know this.

769
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,180
If the Dark Lord finds out that I'm still alive...

770
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,180
...it will be very dangerous.

771
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,180
Okay.

772
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,180
Let's go.

773
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,180
"The Dark Lord"

774
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:42,180
Excuse me, sir.

775
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,180
Are you Jack's teacher?

776
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,180
It's a pleasure to meet you.

777
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,180
I'm Roga.

778
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,180
Jack's daughter.

779
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,180
Where are you going?

780
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,180
Excuse me, sir. I'm going to get my son.

781
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,180
Peace be upon you.

782
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,180
I'm so lucky.

783
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,180
Come on.

784
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,180
So, you've been hiding Gama and Aquila all this time?

785
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,180
Yes.

786
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,180
Where is Gama now?

787
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,180
Why is he gone?

788
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,180
Gama is unconscious.

789
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,180
I've tried to wake him up.

790
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,180
But he's still unconscious.

791
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,180
I'm also wondering...

792
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,180
...why Aquila is conscious again.

793
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,180
Because as far as I know...

794
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,180
...Gama and Aquila can be conscious...

795
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,180
...if their hands are smeared with the Dark Lord's blood.

796
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,180
That's what I know.

797
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:49,180
But I don't have any blood on my hands.

798
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,180
Can you guess what happened?

799
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,180
Aquila.

800
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,180
Do you feel anything strange about yourself?

801
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,180
This ring.

802
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,180
I think I know...

803
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,180
...what gives you the power to do everything.

804
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,180
The ring you're wearing...

805
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,180
...is made of the Sun Stone.

806
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,180
The only stone in the world...

807
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,180
...that has the same energy as the Sun.

808
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,180
That stone must be the one that gives you the power to do everything.

809
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,180
What if I wear that ring forever?

810
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,180
You'll still be alive.

811
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,180
I don't know yet.

812
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,180
But Aquila.

813
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:58,180
Where did you get that ring?

814
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:04,180
I don't remember. I don't know.

815
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:09,180
I just realized that I'm wearing the ring.

816
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,180
I don't care where you got that ring.

817
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:17,180
What matters is that you can come back to life.

818
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,180
Let me see.

819
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:33,180
Why did you take the ring from the ring?

820
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,180
I don't know.

821
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,180
Why is the black color of the ring...

822
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,180
...the same as the skin of a pig's hair?

823
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,180
Alfa.

824
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,180
What's wrong?

825
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,180
Nothing, Sir.

826
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,180
Nothing.

827
00:52:52,180 --> 00:53:11,180
I'm so tired of being a daily job.

828
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,180
Me too.

829
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,180
Don't bother us.

830
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,180
We have to concentrate.

831
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,180
Don't make us make a mistake again.

832
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,180
One.

833
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,180
Two.

834
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
Three.

835
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,180
Teleportation.

836
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,180
Any report today?

837
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,180
Alfa hasn't found the soul stone yet, Sir.

838
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,180
That's all?

839
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,180
There's more.

840
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:45,180
When we took the report, there was Alfa and a woman.

841
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,180
I think it's her mother.

842
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,180
Yes, it's her mother.

843
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,180
Alfa's mother?

844
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,180
Yes, Sir.

845
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:02,180
Is it true that there's a soul stone in this ring?

846
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,180
No, it's impossible.

847
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,180
That's impossible.

848
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,180
Wait.

849
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,180
I think it's safe.

850
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,180
Akhila, you can open it.

851
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,180
Let's see.

852
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:29,180
Akhila.

853
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,180
What are you going to do tonight?

854
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,180
I'm going home.

855
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,180
I feel sorry for Gamma.

856
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,180
Don't.

857
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,180
My house is far away.

858
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,180
You'd better stay here tonight.

859
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,180
Because Alfa will miss you.

860
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,180
Right, Alfa?

861
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,180
Yes, I miss my mother too.

862
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,180
Alfa.

863
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,180
If your mother lives here, where do you want to stay?

864
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,180
In my apartment.

865
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,180
I have an apartment.

866
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,180
We'd better go home.

867
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,180
In my apartment.

868
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,180
You'd better stay in my house.

869
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,180
In my apartment.

870
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,180
I said, in my apartment.

871
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,180
My house.

872
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,180
You don't understand.

873
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,180
I said, in my apartment.

874
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,180
I said, in my house.

875
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,180
My apartment.

876
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,180
In my house.

877
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,180
My apartment.

878
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,180
In my house.

879
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,180
Shh.

880
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,180
It's okay.

881
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,180
[Akhila is going to stay in Gamma's house tonight.]

882
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,180
Sir.

883
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,180
Yes.

884
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:45,180
Can I stay in your apartment tonight?

885
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,180
Sure.

886
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:53,180
Of course.

887
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,180
But there's a condition.

888
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,180
What's that?

889
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,180
I'll do anything you want.

890
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,180
Anything?

891
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,180
Anything.

892
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,180
Okay.

893
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:12,180
I want you to stay in your house tonight.

894
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:18,180
Alfa.

895
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,180
Yes.

896
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,180
I agree.

897
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,180
That's a great idea.

898
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,180
No.

899
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,180
That's not a great idea.

900
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,180
Because...

901
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,180
Alfa.

902
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,180
Alfa has to sleep in the dormitory.

903
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,180
That's the rule.

904
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,180
And...

905
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,180
And that's the rule.

906
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,180
No.

907
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,180
The rule can be broken.

908
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,180
I'll take care of it.

909
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,180
No.

910
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,180
That's the rule.

911
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,180
It's written.

912
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,180
No.

913
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,180
I'll ask for permission.

914
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,180
I'll ask for permission from Professor Aldebaran.

915
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,180
To let Alfa stay in the dormitory.

916
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,180
No.

917
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,180
Professor Aldebaran will never allow it.

918
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:04,180
He will.

919
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,180
Stop.

920
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,180
Shh.

921
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:14,180
Purwa.

922
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,180
I still miss Alfa.

923
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,180
What's the condition?

924
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,180
I'm fine.

925
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,180
Okay.

926
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,180
You can all stay in my dormitory.

927
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:31,180
Okay.

928
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,180
Let's go.

929
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,180
Let's go, Alfa.

930
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,180
Let's go.

931
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:41,180
I've found...

932
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,180
...the third soul stone.

933
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,180
Where is it, Prof?

934
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,180
Where is it?

935
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,180
Where is it, Prof?

936
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
Where is it?

937
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:10,180
Both of Alfa's parents are gone.

938
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,180
Why?

939
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,180
They died.

940
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,180
Don't lie.

941
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,180
If you lie, I won't let you go.

942
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,180
Do you want that?

943
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,180
Yes, Sir.

944
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,180
We're not lying.

945
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,180
It's true.

946
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,180
Enough.

947
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,180
Now, investigate and watch Alfa.

948
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,180
Hurry.

949
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
Yes, Sir.

950
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,180
Teleportation.

951
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,180
Please.

952
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,180
Please come in.

953
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,180
This is my house.

954
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,180
It's a nice house.

955
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,180
It's clean and neat.

956
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,180
Yes, Sir.

957
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,180
It's nice.

958
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,180
Thank you.

959
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,180
Sir, are you okay?

960
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,180
I'm fine.

961
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,180
I'll take care of it later.

962
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,180
Oh, right.

963
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,180
Akhila.

964
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,180
Your room is over there with Alfa.

965
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,180
Okay.

966
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,180
We'll take a rest.

967
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,180
Yes, Sir.

968
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,180
Be careful.

969
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:22,180
Don't be so sad.

970
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,180
Remember.

971
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,180
She's my wife.

972
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:31,180
Get in.

973
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,180
Come.

974
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:46,180
Where is Alfa?

975
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,180
She doesn't come back.

976
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,180
Where is she?

977
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,180
She's gone.

978
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,180
Wait.

979
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,180
Don't tell me.

980
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,180
Alfa...

981
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,180
...was kidnapped by the Dark Lord.

982
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,180
Oh, no.

983
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,180
Don't say that, Plita.

984
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,180
Let's do this.

985
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,180
We'll wait until tomorrow.

986
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:20,180
If Alfa doesn't come tomorrow, we'll report to the Professor.

987
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,180
Do you agree?

988
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,180
I agree.

989
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:30,180
Then, a kind-hearted warrior came to save the princess.

990
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,180
He fought the evil Dark Lord with his sword.

991
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,180
Shoot.

992
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:43,180
And he finally saved the princess he loved.

993
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:50,180
Alfa.

994
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,180
Why are you crying?

995
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,180
I'm sorry.

996
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:02,180
I still can't believe...

997
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:06,180
...that you're in front of me.

998
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:10,180
But I'm happy.

999
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,180
I'm so happy.

1000
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,180
I'll try to stop time.

1001
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,180
I'll always be with you.

1002
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,180
Be patient, honey.

1003
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,180
Your father and I will try to do that.

1004
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:32,180
Mom.

1005
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:37,180
When can I meet my friends?

1006
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:40,180
Not yet, Alfa.

1007
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,180
But even though you don't know your friends yet...

1008
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:50,180
...I'm sure they're good friends for you.

1009
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:54,180
Yes, Mom. They're very good friends.

1010
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:58,180
Mom.

1011
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:07,180
(Alfa's room)

1012
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:35,180
The Fatang Blaster.

1013
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,180
This is better.

1014
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,180
It's time to sleep.

1015
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:44,180
It's safe.

1016
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:59,180
I can't sleep.

1017
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:03,180
I was going to sleep on my head, but now I'm sleeping on my feet.

1018
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,180
I'll remember this.

1019
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,180
I'll wake up and everything will be fine.

1020
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,180
I won't give up.

1021
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,180
(Alfa's room)

1022
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:36,180
Panji.

1023
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,180
This must be you.

1024
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,180
Open it.

1025
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,180
I'm sorry, Sir.

1026
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:48,180
You'll be a ghost when you sleep.

1027
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,180
You're a ghost.

1028
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,180
I'll make you pay.

1029
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,180
Good morning, Sir.

1030
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,180
Alfa.

1031
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,180
What are you doing?

1032
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,180
We were exercising.

1033
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,180
A little exercise.

1034
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,180
To start the Fatang Blaster.

1035
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,180
Please enjoy this.

1036
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:18,180
I'll pour you a drink.

1037
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:33,180
Sir.

1038
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,180
Here.

1039
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:55,180
Sir.

1040
01:04:55,180 --> 01:05:02,180
It's okay.

1041
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,180
(Alfa's room)

1042
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:15,180
I want an egg.

1043
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:20,180
Why are you so angry?

1044
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,180
You're so annoying.

1045
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:27,180
You can't make a noise when you eat.

1046
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,180
Eat properly.

1047
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,180
(Alfa's room)

1048
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:38,180
Kids, calm down.

1049
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,180
Alfa is in a safe place.

1050
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:46,180
Where is she?

1051
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,180
Who knows? She's sad.

1052
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,180
You're good friends.

1053
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,180
You always think of your friends.

1054
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,180
But Alfa is not sad.

1055
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,180
She's happy.

1056
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:04,180
Why is she happy?

1057
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:09,180
Calm down.

1058
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,180
Alfa is fine.

1059
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:15,180
But there's something more important.

1060
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,180
What is it, Sir?

1061
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,180
I've found...

1062
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,180
the third soul stone.

1063
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,180
Where is it?

1064
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,180
It's at Duyung.

1065
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:28,180
Duyung?

1066
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,180
Yes.

1067
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,180
Duyung.

1068
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:36,180
What is that?

1069
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,180
Yes.

1070
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,180
It's a sign of good news.

1071
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:43,180
Alfa is happy.

1072
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,180
What is it?

1073
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,180
Alfa.

1074
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,180
Alfa, where are you?

1075
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,180
We've been looking for you.

1076
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,180
Yes.

1077
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,180
We're worried about you.

1078
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,180
We're worried that you'll be mad at us.

1079
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,180
Mad?

1080
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,180
Why should I be mad?

1081
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,180
You didn't do anything wrong to me.

1082
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,180
You're always mad at us.

1083
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,180
Because we've been looking for you.

1084
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,180
I really miss my dad.

1085
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,180
Don't worry about him.

1086
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,180
I'm sorry.

1087
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,180
Yes.

1088
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,180
I'm worried about my mom.

1089
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,180
I didn't get to introduce her to you.

1090
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,180
It's okay.

1091
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,180
Relax.

1092
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,180
I'm happy too.

1093
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:32,180
You're happy?

1094
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:34,180
What are you happy about?

1095
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:38,180
You're happy that we're here?

1096
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,180
Yes.

1097
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,180
You're happy, right?

1098
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,180
What's wrong?

1099
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,180
I'll tell you later.

1100
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,180
If there's a good time.

1101
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,180
Okay.

1102
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:50,180
Alfa, I have good news.

1103
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:53,180
We're going to the professor's room this morning.

1104
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,180
He has a task for us.

1105
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,180
What task?

1106
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,180
We have to find the third soul stone.

1107
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:07,180
Find the soul stone?

1108
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,180
What does it mean?

1109
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,180
The one in the hand is not the soul stone?

1110
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,180
What?

1111
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,180
The Duyo's book was stolen?

1112
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,180
Yes.

1113
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,180
And we don't know who did it.

1114
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,180
That's weird.

1115
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,180
Why is their book in the magic school?

1116
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,180
Who did it?

1117
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:40,180
I have to educate Alfa again.

1118
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:43,180
To find information about the soul stone.

1119
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:55,180
