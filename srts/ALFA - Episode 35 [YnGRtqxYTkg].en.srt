15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It turns out they've destroyed the first soul stone

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
To get that soul stone...

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What if you...

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Marry Bardi?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, no, no, I don't want to marry him

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Pangeran, make a replacement

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me talk to Pangeran

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Can you?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, start now

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You do the job of a soldier

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But you don't answer me

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, Pangeran

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If I don't marry Bardi

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How can we get that soul stone?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't know what to marry, just say it

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I have a better idea

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, who's next?

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Me

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Go ahead

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, sir

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sure he'll bite me

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, sir

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You use the mantra of deportation and move to the left

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you understand?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, sir

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you ready?

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, sir

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Go ahead

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Deportation!

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Where's Cici?

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh no, Cici's gone again

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, quiet

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Back to the check

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Quiet

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Move

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where did you go, Jack?

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In the forest, boss

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I moved to the forest

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Go back to your seat

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No one can use this mantra properly

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This class is really disappointing

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sir, I want to try

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's the matter?

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry, I'm disturbing your class

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But there's something important I want to talk about

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come with me

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Students

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is the last class

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's the important thing they want to talk about?

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Boss, I think Leon is following the teacher and the teacher

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes, let's follow him

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come on

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I want to give you a difficult task

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But I'm sure you can do it

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What is it, sir?

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Your task is to give this love mantra to Agni

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It means you have to come to the eighth gate

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
My guess is right

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Apparently, this has something to do with the eighth gate

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you doing?

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you doing?

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're lying

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're talking about the teacher, right?

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll kill you

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The teacher is the one who's lying

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What are you doing?

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The teacher is the one who's lying

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Professor

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Run

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Run, Agni

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't know

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Just admit it

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're talking about the teacher

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm not lying

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're lying

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll kill you

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How dare you?

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you doing? Stop

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Stop

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How dare you?

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm the teacher

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Stop

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm the one who's lying

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What?

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He's lying

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll kill you

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Enough

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Go back to your class

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't want to go to class

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want to join the teacher's team

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
To save Professor Agni

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
[The teacher is the one who's lying]

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Leon, that's not possible

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's too dangerous

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No, I'm ready

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm not afraid

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Professor Agni is in this situation because of me

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So, I have to take responsibility

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Leon, you can't do that

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll show him the way

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He doesn't know the meaning of darkness

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can watch him go there

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, Leon

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll let you go

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes, thank you

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
[The teacher is the one who's lying]

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We'll join the team, too

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, I'll join

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Why do you three want to join?

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're making it difficult

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We can't join

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Leon can join

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, we can

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, I'll let you join

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But, you have to be careful

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Enough, stop it

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Just stop it

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Professor

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What are you doing? Join them

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They're the one who's hiding in the dark

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm afraid

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If we join them, we can be the heroes

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We've saved Professor Agni

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If we save him, we can get the money from him

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's go

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
[The teacher is the one who's lying]

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's get the key

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's the key for?

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
To cut his hair

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Cool

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's so big

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's play

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Be careful

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Be careful

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wait

163
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
One, two, three

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:18,000
His hair is so hard

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
(Don't be afraid of me)

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
(I'm not afraid of you)

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
(Where do you see me from?)

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
(I know you're out there somewhere)

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
(But, this time)

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
(My eyes are on you)

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
(And now!)

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
(I'm here!)

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
(This is a real ghost!)

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
(Cannot be seen!)

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
(I'll kill you!)

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
(No!)

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
(Cook!)

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We're being haunted!

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Stop! Stop! Go away!

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Stop!

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Bargi, you're too much!

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Too much!

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We promised to get married!

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But, in reality

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why did you eat them?

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I was wrong about you

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you keep doing that, we'll cancel the wedding!

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I regret it

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't cancel it

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm willing to do anything for you

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, so you're willing to do anything for me?

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Anything

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Alright

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In that case

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I want to get a haircut

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Bargi!

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm here to tell you

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't you dare to do anything to anyone

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do you understand?

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I understand

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And if you do anything to anyone

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You'll be haunted

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And your fate will be the same as Barga's

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes, God

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Bargi?

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Bargi is confused

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Alright, I'll go

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Wait!

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Bargi, think first

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, wait

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Before you go, get them out of the toilet

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hurry!

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You guys are so brazen

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Thank you, sir

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You've saved us again

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're great, Panji

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're really great

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
As a man

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can win a woman's heart

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Shut up!

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We've eaten

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And drank

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, right

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't forget to bring books

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And stories

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay, as a man

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll help Alpha Vega Regan Pelita

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Tele...

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What's the password?

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I forgot

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay, teleport, stop!

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What's wrong?

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, right, teleport, stop!

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I think I'm late

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Where am I?

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Help!

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Help me!

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't tell me I'm in the toilet again

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Help!

242
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm in the toilet

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Tele...

244
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Teleport, for mommy!

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Who's this?

246
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think I'm in the toilet

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,580
(And they are in the same class lol)

248
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,140
(Another smart girl, that's for you)

249
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,440
(Putting all her effort into studying English, lol)

250
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,620
(Jjonyang-a-rush)

251
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,640
(I'm a genius, you know?)

252
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,200
(CHANSUNG-a-rush)

253
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,780
(Clean and tidy)

254
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,040
(Am I cool, bro?)

255
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,500
(Chang-u-rush)

256
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,480
(Don't you dare to look under my seat! LOL)

257
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,660
Eeeeek (He's going to hit me as well)

258
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,280
(UGH)

259
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,260
(This is bad...)

260
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,820
(I'm going to hit you)

261
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,680
Teleport!

262
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,400
BANGKII!

263
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,960
(I'm going to hit you)

264
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Where is he?

265
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
(I'm going to hit you)

266
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm in the tree

267
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:29,740
(I'm going to hit you)

268
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
Don't bother me!

269
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:39,240
(I'm going to hit you)

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Ouch!

271
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm hurt...

272
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:53,240
(I'm going to hit you)

273
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Run!

274
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
(I'm going to hit you)

275
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Prof!

276
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Why are we here?

277
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
We're using lollipop, Prof!

278
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Why don't we use a new spell, Prof?

279
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Yes, Prof!

280
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
What spell is it, Prof?

281
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Tele...

282
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Teleportation!

283
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
How about you?

284
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
The spell was just taught, right?

285
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
If you misuse the spell,

286
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
you'll be punished!

287
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Do you understand?

288
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Yes, Prof!

289
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Why is it so late, Prof?

290
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
We should've waited until nightfall!

291
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Yes, Prof!

292
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
There's a time in the day,

293
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
when the dark night...

294
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
becomes weak.

295
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Oh, so if it's dark,

296
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
the dark night is stronger, Prof?

297
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
That's right.

298
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
That's why we attacked him in the day.

299
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
We had a chance to stop him.

300
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Now, everyone, wait here.

301
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Use the spell to protect you from anything.

302
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I'll go inside to check on you.

303
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Yes, Prof.

304
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Lopurisa!

305
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Armi!

306
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Now, you'll do the basic task.

307
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
You'll catch Leon and Orion.

308
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Yes, Sir!

309
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Then, you'll go to the fire prison.

310
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Yes, Sir!

311
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
But, by the way,

312
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
what's the point of them being caught?

313
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,240
What's the point?

314
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Because they ran away.

315
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
That's why you have to catch them and put them in the fire prison.

316
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
If they ran away,

317
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
the power of the Prince will be reduced.

318
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
The Prince will be damaged.

319
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
You don't think so, right?

320
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
I don't think so.

321
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Then, what's the point of being caught?

322
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Do you want to oppose my order?

323
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,240
No, Sir.

324
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Your Highness, let's do this first.

325
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Do what?

326
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Your hair is not in good condition.

327
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Let's do this, Your Highness.

328
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,240
If you do this,

329
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
you'll look cool and handsome.

330
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Here, Your Highness. Look.

331
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,240
This one?

332
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Cool?

333
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Handsome, right?

334
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Good.

335
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I have another idea, Your Highness.

336
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Your eyes shouldn't be black.

337
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
It's bad, Your Highness.

338
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
You don't look handsome.

339
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
You look weird.

340
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Really?

341
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Like that?

342
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
But, black eyes make me look scary.

343
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
But, a prince looks ugly.

344
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Agni.

345
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
I'll save you right away.

346
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Just wait.

347
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:13,240
I'll get you.

348
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,240
You're hungry.

350
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Don't kill me.

352
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
You're hungry.

353
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Are you hungry?

354
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Here.

355
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
I'll feed you.

356
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Wait.

357
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Here, eat this.

358
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
I don't want it.

359
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
You don't want it?

360
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm hungry.

361
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
I want chocolate.

362
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,240
I'm hungry.

363
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Here.

364
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I don't want it.

365
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
I don't want chocolate.

366
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,240
I want chocolate.

367
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm hungry.

368
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Your Highness, Cinderella.

369
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Here.

370
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
This is Cinderella.

371
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Husband.

372
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,240
This is about Cinderella and her husband.

373
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Husband?

374
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Husband.

375
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm going to die.

376
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

377
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:23,240
I can defeat the monster without Nava's help.

379
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm so happy.

380
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Is Sambargi back yet?

381
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
He's waiting.

382
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Maybe he's busy.

383
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
I don't know.

384
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Kids.

385
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,240
I'm going to make a guess.

386
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Which one do you think?

387
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Do you think Neng Bargi loves his hair more?

388
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Or do you think he loves you more?

389
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Me.

390
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Shut up, Megantara.

391
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
I think...

392
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,240
...Bargi's hair is more beautiful.

393
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I'm serious. I want to marry him.

394
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
That's great.

395
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
I'm still thinking about it.

396
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Then, I'll break my promise.

397
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Right.

398
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
I'm not responsible.

399
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
I've disappointed a woman.

400
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Right.

401
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
Bargi is a woman.

402
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Bargi's heart is as soft as snow.

403
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Right.

404
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Or, he can be called a php.

405
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Bargi's heart is as soft as snow.

406
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Shut up.

407
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Do you know?

408
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm doing everything for you.

409
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Look.

410
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,240
His wife is slow.

411
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:15,240
You're more important than my hair.

412
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
I'm willing to give my hair to you.

413
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:26,240
So, you want to give your hair to me?

414
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Why is the sound of lightning so loud?

416
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Maybe...

417
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,240
...something bad happened to Bargi.

418
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
But, it's impossible.

419
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Because, Alfa and the others...

420
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,240
...are still alive.

421
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,240
They must be dead.

422
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
It means, the 11 souls are still safe.

423
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Yes!

424
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Mommy!

425
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Yes!

426
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,240
We did it!

427
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Yes!

428
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:52,240
We did it!

429
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:01,240
I'll count.

430
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
1, 2, 3.

431
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,240
3, 2, 1.

432
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:17,240
We did it!

433
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,240
We did it.

434
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,240
If we did it, we must go back to the magic school.

435
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Yes.

436
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
That's right, Megantara.

437
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Let's go back.

438
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Let's go.

439
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Bargi wants to get married.

440
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Megantara.

441
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Please help me.

442
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Please let me go.

443
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,240
It's impossible.

444
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
We can't leave him.

445
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
That's right.

446
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Where's his hair?

447
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,240
We got his hair.

448
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Vega.

449
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Do you want to say something to Bargi?

450
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Yes, I do.

451
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
I'm sorry.

452
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Bargi, sit down.

453
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:33,240
This is a hair clip for you.

454
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
It's for your hair.

455
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,240
You can use it when your hair is longer.

456
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Megantara, wait.

457
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I want to say something.

458
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,240
Please persuade Bargi to let me go.

459
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Then, we can go back together.

460
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
That's a good idea, right?

461
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Okay, I agree.

462
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,240
But, I think you're her husband.

463
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,240
You should talk to your wife.

464
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
That's right.

465
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Let's go back.

466
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,240
We did it.

467
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,240
We can go back together.

468
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Don't leave me.

469
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
You're evil.

470
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
You're stupid.

471
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Romantic.

472
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,240
What should I do?

473
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,240
I feel sorry for him.

474
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,240
He's still in the class.

475
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
It's okay.

476
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
He promised.

477
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
We don't have to do it.

478
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Right?

479
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
How about this?

480
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Let's go back to the school.

481
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
We'll meet with the professor.

482
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,240
After we destroy the stone in his hair.

483
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Then, we'll go back to pick up Panji.

484
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
We did it.

485
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Bargi is beautiful.

486
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
"I'm sick."

487
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Ouch, my stomach.

488
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
It hurts.

489
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Don't be sick.

490
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
It hurts.

491
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
I have to be cured by Don Putri.

492
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Give me the medicine.

493
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Medicine?

494
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Yes, medicine.

495
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
It's Don Putri Malu.

496
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Don Putri Malu?

497
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:10,240
You're not the one who's shy.

498
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
But, Don Putri Malu.

499
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
You're not Putri.

500
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Hurry up.

501
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I have Don Putri Malu.

502
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Ouch.

503
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
It hurts.

504
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Hurry up.

505
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Bargi.

506
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
It's okay.

508
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:55,240
This is the father.

509
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,240
He's the one who taught the kids in the school.

510
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Who is this?

511
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
I want to know.

512
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I have to follow him.

513
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
"I'm sick."

514
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Husband?

515
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Where's my husband?

516
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Husband!

517
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Good afternoon, Professor Aldebar.

518
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Good afternoon.

519
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
How is it?

520
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,240
You've succeeded in getting Bargi's hair.

521
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I did it.

522
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,240
He woke up in the morning and ate an orange.

523
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,240
This is Bargi's hair.

524
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
It's as stiff as a tree.

525
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,240
I didn't expect you to get it so quickly.

526
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Thank you.

527
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:29,240
As usual.

528
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Alfa.

529
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
You're the only one who can do this.

530
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:36,240 --> 00:32:02,240
"I'm sick."

532
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:19,240
If they all become my slaves...

533
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,240
...our power will increase.

534
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:36,240
We can do it.

535
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Juri.

536
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
"I'm sick."

537
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Yes!

538
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
We did it.

539
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Yes!

540
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Sir.

541
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Wake up.

542
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Sir.

543
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,240
38 fainted.

544
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
This is a good chance.

545
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Sir.

546
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,240
How can you faint so easily?

547
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,240
You've cut your toenails.

548
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
The bacteria should be dead.

549
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Why did you cut your toenails?

550
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Sir.

551
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,240
Kids, get down to the mat.

552
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Now, we go inside.

553
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
Sir.

554
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,240
Is there a dark room?

555
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
There is.

556
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,240
But, it's a dead end.

557
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,240
This is a good chance to save him.

558
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Let's go.

559
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Let's go, sir.

560
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Let's go.

561
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Oh, no.

562
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,240
You guys.

563
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,240
What do you want to do here?

564
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Akmi.

565
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
We're here to save you.

566
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Save me?

567
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Yes, sir.

568
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Why?

569
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
I'm fine here.

570
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
I don't need to be saved.

571
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Don't run.

572
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Let me go.

573
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Hurry up and give her the medicine.

574
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
Come on.

575
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Okay, sir.

576
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Let's continue.

577
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Hurry up.

578
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Come on.

579
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Let me go.

580
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,240
I don't want to drink your medicine.

581
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Let me go.

582
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
I don't want to drink your medicine.

583
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Let me go.

584
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Calm down.

585
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Hurry up.

586
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Drink it.

587
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:36,240
How dare you to come here without my permission.

588
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
You'll pay for it.

589
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:52,240
Professor.

590
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,240
We've got the first soul stone.

591
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,240
We've got the second soul stone.

592
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
But, next...

593
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,240
we have to find the third soul stone.

594
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,240
The question is...

595
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,240
can we know where the third soul stone is?

596
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Unfortunately, until now...

597
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I haven't got the information where the third soul stone is.

598
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'm dizzy.

599
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
Calm down.

600
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I'll try to get the information.

601
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Professor, if you haven't got the information, can we...

602
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
get one day's permission?

603
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Yes, because we still have something to do with Panji.

604
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Something to do with Panji?

605
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
What is it?

606
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Don't be a pro.

607
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
I'm not a pro.

608
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,240
I'm just saying.

609
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:04,240
I'll go now.

610
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Thank you.

611
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I'll go now.

612
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Yes!

613
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Finally, we've got the second soul stone.

614
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,240
We have to work together.

615
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Now, I'm not dizzy anymore.

616
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,240
What does zinc shrink to strength?

617
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,240
But, we still have to get the tenth soul stone.

618
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
But, we have to be motivated.

619
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,240
We have to be motivated.

620
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
That's right.

621
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Let's go to Panji's house.

622
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Okay.

623
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Hello, everyone.

624
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Mr. Panji.

625
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Mr. Panji, you scared me.

626
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
You're a good boy, right?

627
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
I'm a good boy.

628
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
Mr. Panji, are you ready?

629
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Are you ready?

630
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,240
We were going to invite you.

631
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
What are you talking about?

632
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Don't go there.

633
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
I'm not getting married.

634
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
That's right, Mr. Panji.

635
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
He's your husband.

636
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Yes.

637
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,240
But, I was thinking...

638
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,240
It's his business, not mine.

639
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Mr. Panji.

640
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
How do you do it?

641
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,240
I'm not Panji if you can't do it.

642
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Mr. Panji.

643
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
How is it?

644
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
It's good.

645
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
What are you doing?

646
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Be careful.

647
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:34,240
Husband.

648
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:45,240
This is the spirit of Panji.

649
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,240
He's following the ghost.

650
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,240
I'm following the ghost.

651
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
I have to stop the ghost.

652
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,240
So, I can find the other ghosts.

653
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:28,240
I'm going to find the other ghosts.

654
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Your knowledge is useless.

655
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
You're all useless.

656
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Enough, Leon.

657
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
You're the best.

658
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
You're coming with me.

659
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
Why are you in a magic school? You're useless.

660
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
No.

661
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,240
I don't want to be with a bad person like you.

662
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Enough.

663
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Your wish is my command.

664
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:22,240
Release.

665
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
What's wrong?

666
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
I'm going to kill you.

667
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
What's wrong with you? Why did you want them?

668
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Don't.

669
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Because when I was in school,

670
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
I was taught that we can't kill people.

671
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
That's a sin.

672
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
You can't, Mr. Erat.

673
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
That's true.

674
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
My teacher said that too.

675
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
You know that's a sin, right?

676
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
So, what should we do now?

677
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
Calm down, Sir.

678
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
We should make them...

679
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
become your followers.

680
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
So, there will be a lot of followers.

681
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Not just one or two people.

682
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,240
You're right, Om Aki.

683
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
If they all become my followers,

684
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,240
our power will increase.

685
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,240
You take care of everything.

686
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
I'll take care of the rest.

687
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Del,

688
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
let's go.

689
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
Professor Rani,

690
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,240
I know you won't hurt us.

691
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Come on.

692
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Drink this potion.

693
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Come on, Professor.

694
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Come on, Professor. Let's go.

695
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Yes, Professor.

696
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Drink it, Professor.

697
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,240
So, Professor Ali can come home with us.

698
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
I'm not going to be here.

699
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
Professor Rani,

700
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
come on.

701
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Drink this potion.

702
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Professor Ali!

703
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Rakif,

704
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
you said you wanted to save us.

705
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Let go of me.

706
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Help us, Professor.

707
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
We're in the wrong, Professor.

708
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
Help us, Professor.

709
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,240
I'm not the one who's going to drink this potion.

710
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
You all are.

711
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Professor Ali,

712
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
I told you, Aki.

713
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,240
Don't let anyone touch you.

714
00:43:32,240 --> 00:44:01,240
My husband!

715
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
What's going on?

716
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,240
Welcome to Cinta Super's meeting.

717
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,240
This meeting will make you all...

718
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,240
obey whatever the government says.

719
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,240
I'm not going to drink that potion.

720
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
Yes, Professor.

721
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
The director of the dark is evil.

722
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
But you're not like him.

723
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
You don't know that you're his followers.

724
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Yes, Professor.

725
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
We're not a group.

726
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
Shut up, all of you.

727
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
It's useless for you to scream.

728
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,240
If the dark is listening,

729
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
you can all be punished.

730
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
It's even worse.

731
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
You're all going to the dark.

732
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Enough.

733
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Shut up.

734
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
Don't make noise.

735
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
Drink this now.

736
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
Drink.

737
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
I'm going to drink the Ramonito.

738
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,240
I'm sorry, my dear.

739
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,240
I attacked you first.

740
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
Yes.

741
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,240
If you win,

742
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,240
I'll give you Ramona.

743
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
But if I lose,

744
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,240
you have to give me Ramona.

745
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,240
Who's afraid?

746
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Why is your hair so short?

747
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Where's your hair?

748
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
My hair is gone.

749
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,240
You must have given your hair to someone else.

750
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,240
To my husband.

751
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,240
What husband?

752
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,240
My husband.

753
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,240
I told you.

754
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,240
Don't give your hair to anyone.

755
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,240
I'm sorry.

756
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,240
Your mistake is fatal.

757
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
I'm not sorry.

758
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:29,240
I'm sorry.

759
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
You've lost your hair.

760
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,240
And you've made my soul broken.

761
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
Feel this.

762
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Ouch.

763
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,240
I'm sorry.

764
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,240
What's wrong?

765
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,240
You've been grumbling.

766
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:55,240
I don't know.

767
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,240
I don't feel good.

768
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,240
What's wrong?

769
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,240
I miss...

770
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,240
My uncle.

771
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,240
You miss him?

772
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
Yes.

773
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,240
I miss him.

774
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,240
Don't be noisy.

775
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,240
If you miss him,

776
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,240
you have to come to him.

777
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
That's enough.

778
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,240
Finish your food.

779
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
I feel sorry for Bargi.

780
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,240
He's in the same class with his husband.

781
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
Imagine if he's in the news.

782
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,240
He can't imagine.

783
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,240
But...

784
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,240
Bargi must be heartbroken.

785
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,240
His heart is broken.

786
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,240
Shut up.

787
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
I'm sorry.

788
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,240
It's okay.

789
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:13,240
What are you doing?

790
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
You're a bully.

791
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
Shut up.

792
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:24,240
You're a bully.

793
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
I'm going to hit you.

794
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
It hurts.

795
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,240
I'm sorry.

796
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
It hurts.

797
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:46,240
Who's that?

798
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
I'm dead.

799
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,240
Yes.

800
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,240
If I get caught,

801
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,240
I can't be caught.

802
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:18,240
Teleport.

803
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
I'm sorry.

804
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:27,240
There's no one.

805
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,240
Those kids.

806
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,240
They're making me angry.

807
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:42,240
It's better to be here.

808
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,240
It's better to live a fresh life.

809
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
I'm sorry.

810
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:58,240
Ouch.

811
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,240
What are you doing?

812
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Where are you from?

813
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,240
Is this a school?

814
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
Yes, it is.

815
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
Yes.

816
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,240
Thank God.

817
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
I'm from the 8th Pangerang.

818
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Where are you from?

819
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,240
I'm from the 8th Pangerang.

820
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
The 8th Pangerang?

821
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Yes, the 8th Pangerang.

822
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,240
I'm a bully.

823
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,240
A bully?

824
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,240
You met a bully?

825
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
Yes.

826
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
He was hit by a car.

827
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,240
Yes.

828
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,240
He asked for forgiveness.

829
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
He was hurt.

830
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
Where did it happen?

831
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
In the forest.

832
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Get the lollipop.

833
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,240
Fly.

834
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
Don't do that.

835
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,240
Because...

836
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,240
he loves me.

837
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:17,240
We can do this.

838
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Bro, I must win.

839
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:27,240
I must win.

840
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,240
Bro, beat him.

841
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
He's almost dead.

842
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Let's go.

843
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:43,240
You're a bully.

844
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,240
You're hurting my son.

845
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
Get the lollipop.

846
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Beat him.

847
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,240
I must win.

848
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Who wants to be a bully?

849
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Beat him.

850
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:21,240
I must win.

851
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240
Beat him.

852
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,240
Admit it, Agni.

853
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
You lost.

854
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Now you must drink my wine.

855
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:41,240
It's a deal.

856
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,240
I want a drink.

857
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,240
Thank you, Yana.

858
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Mr. Fahmi.

859
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
I want a drink.

860
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:03,240
You're a bully.

861
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:10,240
Now you must drink my wine.

862
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,240
It's a deal.

863
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,240
You must drink my wine.

864
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
I want a drink.

865
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:41,240
Bargi.

866
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240
I want a drink.

867
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
The eighth call.

868
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:20,240
You've gone too far.

869
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:30,240
You deserve it.

870
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,240
No.

871
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
Don't.

872
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
He's my professor.

873
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,240
Don't give it to him.

874
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
He's my professor.

875
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
Shut up.

876
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,240
No.

877
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,240
I don't want it.

878
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,240
Drink it.

879
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:15,240
Who made this?

880
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:23,240
It's disgusting.

881
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,240
This is my drink.

882
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,240
I'm the one who made it.

883
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,240
You're changing your behavior.

884
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,240
Why?

885
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:43,240
I'm not a good person?

886
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,240
You're not doing your job.

887
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Because I'll make you...

888
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,240
...not a good person.

889
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
Let me go.

890
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,240
Ankara.

891
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,240
Now...

892
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,240
...you should be a good sister.

893
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,240
A sister who understands the school tradition.

894
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,240
No, I don't want it.

895
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,240
No.

896
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,240
Let me go.

897
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,240
Drink it.

898
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,240
So, I can be the only one who can help you.

899
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:30,240
Drink it.

900
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:53,240
Husband.

901
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,240
I'm sorry, ma'am.

902
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,240
Because of me...

903
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,240
...you're left by the prince.

904
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,240
Husband.

905
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:13,240
Give me the compress.

906
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Give me the medicine.

907
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:25,240
Husband.

908
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,240
I have to clean his wound...

909
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,240
...and cure him.

910
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:15,240
Suhami.

911
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,240
Bargi.

912
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,240
Why are you left by the dark shadow?

913
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
Bargi.

914
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
A traitor.

915
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
A traitor?

916
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
What kind of traitor?

917
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:40,240
Don't you dare to touch anyone's hair.

918
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,240
Do you understand?

919
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,240
I understand.

920
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,240
And if you touch anyone's hair...

921
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,240
...I'll destroy you.

922
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,240
And your fate will be the same as Bargi's.

923
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,240
Yes, sir.

924
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,240
But...

925
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,240
...if that's the case...

926
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,240
...why did you give me your hair?

927
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,240
Because...

928
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,240
...Bargi loves me.

929
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,240
Bargi is very tired.

930
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,240
Bargi wants to sleep.

931
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,240
No. Don't, Bargi.

932
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,240
Don't sleep.

933
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,240
Your wound is severe.

934
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,240
If you sleep, you'll get a bruise and you'll...

935
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,240
No. Just don't sleep. Okay?

936
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,240
Bargi is tired.

937
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,240
Bargi, I said don't sleep.

938
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
Okay.

939
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,240
Let's talk.

940
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,240
We'll talk about many things.

941
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,240
I'll accompany you. Just don't sleep. Okay?

942
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,240
Go to sleep.

943
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:12,240
Bargi?

944
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,240
Bargi, wake up.

945
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,240
Bargi?

946
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,240
I'll make you all...

947
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,240
...fall in love with me.

948
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:40,240
Bargi! Wake up.

949
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,240
That's my uncle's voice.

950
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Yes. Why did he call you?

951
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,240
Let's go.

952
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,240
Bargi!

953
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,240
What's wrong, uncle?

954
01:00:53,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Bargi! Wake up!

955
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,240
This is all my fault.

956
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,240
I caused Bargi to be like this.

957
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,240
I asked for his hair.

958
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,240
That's why Bargi was tortured by the 8th prince.

959
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,240
Oh, right. I read in a book...

960
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,240
...that if a monster is in a bad condition...

961
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,240
...there's only one way to revive it.

962
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,240
How, Fik?

963
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,240
The way is...

964
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,240
...to kiss its penis.

965
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,240
Kiss?

966
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,240
That's right.

967
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,240
Let's kiss.

968
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,240
Come on, kiss it.

969
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,240
Kiss it.

970
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,240
No, I can't.

971
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
I don't want to kiss it.

972
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,240
But, Uncle, you're upset, right?

973
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,240
I'm not.

974
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
You're upset, right?

975
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,240
Because Bargi is like this.

976
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,240
You're upset, right? Then, just kiss it.

977
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,240
Don't let Bargi die in vain.

978
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,240
Please, Uncle.

979
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,240
Please.

980
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,240
Okay.

981
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,240
I'll kiss it.

982
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

983
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:47,240
Bargi.

984
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,240
Bargi, you're awake.

985
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

986
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,240
What's wrong with Bargi?

987
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,240
Maybe it's true what I read in a book.

988
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,240
What's in the book?

989
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
What's that? A love story?

990
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,240
What's in the love story?

991
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,240
Guys, the monster that kissed the prince...

992
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,240
...will become a beautiful princess.

993
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

994
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,240
Just like me, Berwi.

995
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,240
You're a monster, Bargi.

996
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:51,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

997
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,240
Why isn't it a princess?

998
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

999
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,240
Why is it bigger than the world?

1000
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:13,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

1001
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,240
Oh, right.

1002
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,240
You think this is a storybook.

1003
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,240
But it's a reality for kids.

1004
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

1005
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,240
Poor me.

1006
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,240
I thought I'd get a beautiful wife.

1007
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,240
But it turns out...

1008
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,240
I'm a loser.

1009
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

1010
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,240
Poor me.

1011
01:04:37,240 --> 01:05:01,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

1012
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,240
Professor Purwa?

1013
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

1014
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,240
Ankara?

1015
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,240
Professor Purwa?

1016
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,240
Why am I here?

1017
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:21,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

1018
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,240
I succeeded.

1019
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,240
And I'm back to being the only one who pays the bill.

1020
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,240
I don't have a competitor anymore.

1021
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,240
(Bargi's penis is being removed)

1022
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,240
Professor Purwa?

1023
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,240
Why can we be with this creature?

1024
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,240
You've won the love lottery.

1025
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,240
You've become a follower of the 8th prince.

1026
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,240
No, no, no way.

1027
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,240
I don't want to be a follower of the 8th prince.

1028
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,240
Agni, you can say that because you're aware

1029
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,240
that you've done a lot of bad things.

1030
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:06,240
Ankara, it's better if you let go of my hand.

1031
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,240
No, that's impossible, Agni.

1032
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,240
Because now, I'm going to make all of you

1033
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,240
bow to the 8th prince.

1034
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:28,240
(Bow to the 8th prince)

1035
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,240
Agni!

1036
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,240
Agni, I'm home.

1037
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,240
Bring me some food.

1038
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,240
But that's the 8th prince's voice.

1039
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,240
Why is he calling me?

1040
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
I told you, Agni.

1041
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,240
You've become a follower of the 8th prince.

1042
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,240
Now, I'm going to report this.

1043
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,240
He'll be very happy.

1044
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:57,240
Watch out!

1045
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,240
Sir, what's wrong?

1046
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,240
Since when did you become Agni?

1047
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,240
I called you Agni, why did you show up?

1048
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,240
I'm your servant.

1049
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,240
Oh, yes.

1050
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
Ankara, you're in the discourse.

1051
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,240
Why are you here?

1052
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,240
Sir, please don't be angry.

1053
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,240
I've apologized to you.

1054
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,240
There's no more apology for you, Ankara.

1055
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,240
I'm sick of being angry with you.

1056
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,240
Sir, please understand me.

1057
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,240
I can't not be your servant for a day.

1058
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,240
So, please understand me.

1059
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,240
I'll be your servant for the rest of my life.

1060
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,240
I'll be your servant.

1061
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,240
Sir, I have an extraordinary gift for you.

1062
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,240
What gift?

1063
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,240
When you left,

1064
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,240
Purwa and some students from the magic school...

1065
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,240
came to report you, sir.

1066
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,240
What?

1067
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,240
I don't know, sir.

1068
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,240
I was lucky to see them.

1069
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,240
What about Agni?

1070
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,240
Agni is conscious, sir.

1071
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Because he was given a consultation by Purwa.

1072
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,240
Agni is conscious?

1073
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:16,240
But I managed to catch all of them, sir.

1074
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,240
Including Agni.

1075
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,240
And I've tied them up very tightly, sir.

1076
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,240
So, they won't be able to get out.

1077
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:27,240
And there will be many new candidates, sir.

1078
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,240
(The next day)

1079
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:43,240
I'm scared of lizards.

1080
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:54,240
My husband.

1081
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,240
What is it, Bargi?

1082
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:03,240
Your hair is so smooth, Bargi.

1083
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:09,240
I said no.

1084
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,240
Bargi, don't ask.

1085
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,240
You can't.

1086
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:35,240
(The next day)

1087
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:42,240
Chase your dreams

1088
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,240
Go, go, go

1089
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,240
Achieve all your dreams

1090
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,240
Go, go, go

1091
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,240
Never stop

1092
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,240
Go, go, go

1093
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:56,240
Fight with all your might

1094
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,240
Go, go, go

1095
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,240
Make yourself proud

1096
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,240
Go, go, go

1097
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,240
Let's dream

1098
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,240
Go, go, go

1099
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,240
We will

1100
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,360
Bye bye..
