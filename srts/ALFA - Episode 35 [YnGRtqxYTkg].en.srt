00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 To be continued...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 To be continued...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 To be continued...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 To be continued...

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 To be continued...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, run with courage

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Enough!

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 It turns out they've destroyed the first soul stone

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 To get that soul stone...

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 What if you...

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Marry Bardi?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 No, no, no, I don't want to marry him

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Pangeran, make a replacement

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Let me talk to Pangeran

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Can you?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Yes

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Okay, start now

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 You do the job of a soldier

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 But you don't answer me

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Yes, Pangeran

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 If I don't marry Bardi

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 How can we get that soul stone?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I don't know what to marry, just say it

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 But I have a better idea

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Okay, who's next?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Me

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Go ahead

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Yes, sir

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I'm sure he'll bite me

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Okay, sir

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Okay

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 You use the mantra of deportation and move to the left

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Do you understand?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Yes, sir

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Are you ready?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yes, sir

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Go ahead

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Deportation!

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Where's Cici?

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Where's Cici?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Oh no, Cici's gone again

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Okay, quiet

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Back to the check

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Hello, hello, hello, hello

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Quiet

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Move

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Where did you go, Jack?

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 In the forest, boss

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 I moved to the forest

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'm sorry

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Go back to your seat

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 No one can use this mantra properly

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 This class is really disappointing

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Sir, I want to try

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Okay

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 What's the matter?

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I'm sorry, I'm disturbing your class

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 But there's something important I want to talk about

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Come with me

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Okay

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Students

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 This is the last class

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 What's the important thing they want to talk about?

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Boss, I think Leon is following the teacher and the teacher

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Yes, let's follow him

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Come on

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I want to give you a difficult task

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 But I'm sure you can do it

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 What is it, sir?

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Your task is to give this love mantra to Agni

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It means you have to come to the eighth gate

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 My guess is right

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Apparently, this has something to do with the eighth gate

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 What are you doing?

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Yes

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 What are you doing?

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 You're lying

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 You're talking about the teacher, right?

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I'll kill you

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 The teacher is the one who's lying

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 What are you doing?

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 The teacher is the one who's lying

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Professor

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Run

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Run, Agni

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I don't know

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Just admit it

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You're talking about the teacher

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Yes

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I'm not lying

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 You're lying

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 I'll kill you

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 How dare you?

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 How dare you?

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 What are you doing? Stop

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Stop

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 How dare you?

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I'm the teacher

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I'm the teacher

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Stop

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Stop

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I'm the one who's lying

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 What?

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 He's lying

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I'll kill you

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Yes

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Enough

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Go back to your class

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I don't want to go to class

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I want to join the teacher's team

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 To save Professor Agni

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 [The teacher is the one who's lying]

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Leon, that's not possible

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 It's too dangerous

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 No, I'm ready

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I'm not afraid

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Professor Agni is in this situation because of me

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 So, I have to take responsibility

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Leon, you can't do that

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I'll show him the way

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 He doesn't know the meaning of darkness

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I can watch him go there

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Okay, Leon

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'll let you go

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Yes, thank you

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 [The teacher is the one who's lying]

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 We'll join the team, too

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Yes, I'll join

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Why do you three want to join?

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 You're making it difficult

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 We can't join

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Leon can join

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Yes, we can

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Okay, I'll let you join

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But, you have to be careful

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Yes

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Enough, stop it

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Just stop it

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Professor

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Yes

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 What are you doing? Join them

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 They're the one who's hiding in the dark

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I'm afraid

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 If we join them, we can be the heroes

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 We've saved Professor Agni

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 If we save him, we can get the money from him

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Yes

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Let's go

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Let's go

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 [The teacher is the one who's lying]

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Let's get the key

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 What's the key for?

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 To cut his hair

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Cool

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 It's so big

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Let's play

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Be careful

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Let's go

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Be careful

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Wait

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 One, two, three

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 One, two, three

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 His hair is so hard

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 (Don't be afraid of me)

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 (I'm not afraid of you)

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 (Where do you see me from?)

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 (I know you're out there somewhere)

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 (But, this time)

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 (My eyes are on you)

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 (And now!)

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 (I'm here!)

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 (This is a real ghost!)

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 (Cannot be seen!)

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 (I'll kill you!)

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 (I'll kill you!)

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 (No!)

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 (Cook!)

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 We're being haunted!

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Stop! Stop! Go away!

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Stop!

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Bargi, you're too much!

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Too much!

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 We promised to get married!

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 But, in reality

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Why did you eat them?

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I was wrong about you

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 If you keep doing that, we'll cancel the wedding!

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I'm sorry

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I regret it

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I regret it

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Don't cancel it

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I'm willing to do anything for you

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Oh, so you're willing to do anything for me?

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Anything

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Alright

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 In that case

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I want to get a haircut

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Bargi!

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I'm here to tell you

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Don't you dare to do anything to anyone

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Do you understand?

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I understand

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And if you do anything to anyone

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 You'll be haunted

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And your fate will be the same as Barga's

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Yes, God

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Bargi?

219
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Bargi is confused

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Bargi is confused

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Bargi is confused

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Alright, I'll go

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Wait!

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Bargi, think first

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Okay, wait

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Before you go, get them out of the toilet

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Hurry!

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 You guys are so brazen

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Thank you, sir

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 You've saved us again

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 You're great, Panji

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 You're really great

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 As a man

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 You can win a woman's heart

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Shut up!

236
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 We've eaten

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And drank

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Oh, right

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Don't forget to bring books

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And stories

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Okay, as a man

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I'll help Alpha Vega Regan Pelita

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Okay

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Tele...

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 What's the password?

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I forgot

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Okay, teleport, stop!

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 What's wrong?

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Oh, right, teleport, stop!

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I think I'm late

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Where am I?

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Help!

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Help me!

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Don't tell me I'm in the toilet again

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Help!

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 I'm in the toilet

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Tele...

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Teleport, for mommy!

259
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Teleport, for mommy!

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Who's this?

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I think I'm in the toilet

262
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,580
 (And they are in the same class lol)

263
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,140
 (Another smart girl, that's for you)

264
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,440
 (Putting all her effort into studying English, lol)

265
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,620
 (Jjonyang-a-rush)

266
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,640
 (I'm a genius, you know?)

267
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,200
 (CHANSUNG-a-rush)

268
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,780
 (Clean and tidy)

269
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,040
 (Am I cool, bro?)

270
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,500
 (Chang-u-rush)

271
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,480
 (Don't you dare to look under my seat! LOL)

272
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,700
 Eeeeek (He's going to hit me as well)

273
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,420
 Eeeeek (He's going to hit me as well)

274
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,660
 Eeeeek (He's going to hit me as well)

275
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,280
 (UGH)

276
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,260
 (This is bad...)

277
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,820
 (I'm going to hit you)

278
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,680
 Teleport!

279
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,400
 BANGKII!

280
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,300
 (I'm going to hit you)

281
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,960
 (I'm going to hit you)

282
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,800
 Where is he?

283
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 (I'm going to hit you)

284
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 (I'm going to hit you)

285
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
 I'm in the tree

286
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
 (I'm going to hit you)

287
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
 (I'm going to hit you)

288
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
 (I'm going to hit you)

289
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
 (I'm going to hit you)

290
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 (I'm going to hit you)

291
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
 (I'm going to hit you)

292
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,740
 (I'm going to hit you)

293
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
 Don't bother me!

294
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

295
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

296
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

297
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

298
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

299
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
 Ouch!

300
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
 I'm hurt...

301
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

302
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

303
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

304
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

305
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

306
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
 Run!

307
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
 (I'm going to hit you)

308
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
 Prof!

309
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
 Why are we here?

310
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
 We're using lollipop, Prof!

311
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
 Why don't we use a new spell, Prof?

312
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 Yes, Prof!

313
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
 What spell is it, Prof?

314
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 Tele...

315
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
 Teleportation!

316
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
 How about you?

317
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
 The spell was just taught, right?

318
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
 If you misuse the spell,

319
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
 you'll be punished!

320
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
 Do you understand?

321
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
 Yes, Prof!

322
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
 Why is it so late, Prof?

323
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
 We should've waited until nightfall!

324
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
 Yes, Prof!

325
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
 There's a time in the day,

326
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
 when the dark night...

327
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
 becomes weak.

328
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
 Oh, so if it's dark,

329
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
 the dark night is stronger, Prof?

330
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
 That's right.

331
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
 That's why we attacked him in the day.

332
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
 We had a chance to stop him.

333
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,240
 Now, everyone, wait here.

334
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,240
 Use the spell to protect you from anything.

335
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
 I'll go inside to check on you.

336
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
 Yes, Prof.

337
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 Lopurisa!

338
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:18,240
 Armi!

339
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
 Now, you'll do the basic task.

340
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
 You'll catch Leon and Orion.

341
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
 Yes, Sir!

342
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
 Then, you'll go to the fire prison.

343
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
 Yes, Sir!

344
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
 But, by the way,

345
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
 what's the point of them being caught?

346
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,240
 What's the point?

347
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
 Because they ran away.

348
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
 That's why you have to catch them and put them in the fire prison.

349
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
 If they ran away,

350
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
 the power of the Prince will be reduced.

351
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
 The Prince will be damaged.

352
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
 You don't think so, right?

353
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
 I don't think so.

354
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,240
 Then, what's the point of being caught?

355
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
 Do you want to oppose my order?

356
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,240
 No, Sir.

357
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,240
 Your Highness, let's do this first.

358
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
 Do what?

359
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 Your hair is not in good condition.

360
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
 Let's do this, Your Highness.

361
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,240
 If you do this,

362
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
 you'll look cool and handsome.

363
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
 Here, Your Highness. Look.

364
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,240
 This one?

365
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
 Cool?

366
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
 Handsome, right?

367
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
 Good.

368
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
 I have another idea, Your Highness.

369
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
 Your eyes shouldn't be black.

370
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
 It's bad, Your Highness.

371
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 You don't look handsome.

372
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
 You look weird.

373
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
 Really?

374
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
 Like that?

375
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
 But, black eyes make me look scary.

376
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
 But, a prince looks ugly.

377
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,240
 Agni.

378
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
 I'll save you right away.

379
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
 Just wait.

380
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:13,240
 I'll get you.

381
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
 I'm sorry.

382
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,240
 You're hungry.

383
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
 I'm sorry.

384
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
 Don't kill me.

385
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
 You're hungry.

386
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 Are you hungry?

387
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
 Here.

388
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
 I'll feed you.

389
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
 Wait.

390
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
 Here, eat this.

391
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
 I don't want it.

392
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
 You don't want it?

393
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
 I'm hungry.

394
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 I want chocolate.

395
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,240
 I'm hungry.

396
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,240
 Here.

397
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
 I don't want it.

398
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
 I don't want chocolate.

399
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,240
 I want chocolate.

400
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
 I'm hungry.

401
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
 Your Highness, Cinderella.

402
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,240
 Here.

403
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
 This is Cinderella.

404
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,240
 Husband.

405
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 This is about Cinderella and her husband.

406
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
 Husband?

407
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,240
 Husband.

408
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,240
 Husband.

409
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
 Husband.

410
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,240
 I'm going to die.

411
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,240
 I'm sorry, Your Highness.

412
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,240
 I'm sorry.

413
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:23,240
 I can defeat the monster without Nava's help.

414
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,240
 I'm so happy.

415
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,240
 Is Sambargi back yet?

416
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
 He's waiting.

417
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
 Maybe he's busy.

418
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
 I don't know.

419
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
 Kids.

420
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,240
 I'm going to make a guess.

421
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
 Which one do you think?

422
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,240
 Do you think Neng Bargi loves his hair more?

423
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,240
 Or do you think he loves you more?

424
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
 Me.

425
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,240
 Shut up, Megantara.

426
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
 I think...

427
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,240
 ...Bargi's hair is more beautiful.

428
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
 I'm serious. I want to marry him.

429
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
 That's great.

430
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
 I'm still thinking about it.

431
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
 Then, I'll break my promise.

432
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
 Right.

433
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
 I'm not responsible.

434
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
 I've disappointed a woman.

435
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
 Right.

436
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
 Bargi is a woman.

437
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
 Bargi's heart is as soft as snow.

438
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
 Right.

439
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
 Or, he can be called a php.

440
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
 Bargi's heart is as soft as snow.

441
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
 Shut up.

442
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
 Do you know?

443
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,240
 I'm doing everything for you.

444
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
 Look.

445
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,240
 His wife is slow.

446
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:15,240
 You're more important than my hair.

447
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
 I'm willing to give my hair to you.

448
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:26,240
 So, you want to give your hair to me?

449
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
 I'm sorry.

450
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,240
 Why is the sound of lightning so loud?

451
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
 Maybe...

452
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,240
 ...something bad happened to Bargi.

453
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
 But, it's impossible.

454
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
 Because, Alva and the others...

455
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,240
 ...are still alive.

456
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,240
 They must be dead.

457
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
 It means, the 11 souls are still safe.

458
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
 Yes!

459
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
 Yes!

460
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
 Yes!

461
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,240
 Mommy!

462
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,240
 Yes!

463
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,240
 We did it!

464
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
 Yes!

465
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
 We did it!

466
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
 We did it!

467
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
 We did it!

468
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:01,240
 I'll count.

469
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
 1, 2, 3.

470
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,240
 3, 2, 1.

471
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:15,240
 We did it!

472
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
 We did it!

473
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,240
 We did it.

474
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,240
 If we did it, we must go back to the magic school.

475
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
 Yes.

476
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
 That's right, Megantara.

477
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
 Let's go back.

478
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
 Let's go.

479
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 Bargi wants to get married.

480
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
 Megantara.

481
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
 Please help me.

482
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
 Please help me.

483
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
 Please let me go.

484
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,240
 It's impossible.

485
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
 We can't leave him.

486
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
 That's right.

487
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,240
 Where's his hair?

488
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,240
 We got his hair.

489
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,240
 Vega.

490
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,240
 Do you want to say something to Bargi?

491
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
 Yes, I do.

492
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
 I'm sorry.

493
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,240
 Bargi, sit down.

494
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:33,240
 This is a hair clip for you.

495
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
 It's for your hair.

496
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,240
 You can use it when your hair is longer.

497
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
 Megantara, wait.

498
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
 I want to say something.

499
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,240
 Please persuade Bargi to let me go.

500
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
 Then, we can go back together.

501
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
 That's a good idea, right?

502
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
 Okay, I agree.

503
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,240
 But, I think you're her husband.

504
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,240
 You should talk to your wife.

505
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
 That's right.

506
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
 Let's go back.

507
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
 We did it.

508
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
 We did it.

509
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
 We did it.

510
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,240
 We can go back together.

511
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
 Don't leave me.

512
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
 You're evil.

513
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
 You're stupid.

514
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
 Romantic.

515
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,240
 What should I do?

516
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,240
 I feel sorry for him.

517
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,240
 He's still in the class.

518
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
 It's okay.

519
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
 He promised.

520
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
 We don't have to do it.

521
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
 Right?

522
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
 How about this?

523
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
 Let's go back to the school.

524
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
 We'll meet with the professor.

525
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 After we destroy the stone in his hair.

526
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
 Then, we'll go back to pick up Panji.

527
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
 We did it.

528
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,240
 Bargi is beautiful.

529
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,240
 Bargi is beautiful.

530
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
 "I'm sick."

531
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:34,240
 Ouch, my stomach.

532
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
 It hurts.

533
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
 Don't be sick.

534
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
 It hurts.

535
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
 I have to be cured by Don Putri.

536
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
 Give me the medicine.

537
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
 Medicine?

538
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
 Medicine?

539
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
 Yes, medicine.

540
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
 It's Don Putri Malu.

541
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,240
 Don Putri Malu?

542
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:10,240
 You're not the one who's shy.

543
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
 But, Don Putri Malu.

544
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
 You're not Putri.

545
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,240
 Hurry up.

546
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
 I have Don Putri Malu.

547
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,240
 Ouch.

548
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
 It hurts.

549
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
 Hurry up.

550
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:39,240
 Bargi.

551
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
 I'm sorry.

552
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
 It's okay.

553
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:55,240
 This is the father.

554
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,240
 He's the one who taught the kids in the school.

555
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
 Who is this?

556
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
 I want to know.

557
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
 I have to follow him.

558
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
 "I'm sick."

559
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,240
 Husband?

560
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,240
 Where's my husband?

561
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,240
 Where's my husband?

562
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,240
 Where's my husband?

563
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,240
 Where's my husband?

564
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,240
 Husband!

565
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,240
 Good afternoon, Professor Aldebar.

566
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
 Good afternoon.

567
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
 How is it?

568
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,240
 You've succeeded in getting Bargi's hair.

569
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,240
 I did it.

570
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,240
 He woke up in the morning and ate an orange.

571
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,240
 This is Bargi's hair.

572
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
 It's as stiff as a tree.

573
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,240
 I didn't expect you to get it so quickly.

574
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
 Thank you.

575
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:29,240
 As usual.

576
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
 Alva.

577
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
 You're the only one who can do this.

578
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
 I'm sorry.

579
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
 "I'm sick."

580
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
 "I'm sick."

581
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
 "I'm sick."

582
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
 "I'm sick."

583
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
 "I'm sick."

584
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,240
 "I'm sick."

585
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,240
 "I'm sick."

586
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,240
 "I'm sick."

587
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
 "I'm sick."

588
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:19,240
 If they all become my slaves...

589
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,240
 ...our power will increase.

590
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,240
 We can do it.

591
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:36,240
 We can do it.

592
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,240
 Juri.

593
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
 "I'm sick."

594
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:59,240
 Yes!

595
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
 We did it.

596
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
 Yes!

597
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:28,240
 Sir.

598
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
 Sir.

599
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
 Wake up.

600
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
 Sir.

601
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,240
 38 fainted.

602
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
 This is a good chance.

603
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,240
 Sir.

604
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,240
 How can you faint so easily?

605
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,240
 You've cut your toenails.

606
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
 The bacteria should be dead.

607
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,240
 Why did you cut your toenails?

608
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
 Sir.

609
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
 Sir.

610
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
 Sir.

611
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,240
 Kids, get down to the mat.

612
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,240
 Now, we go inside.

613
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
 Sir.

614
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,240
 Is there a dark room?

615
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
 There is.

616
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,240
 But, it's a dead end.

617
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,240
 This is a good chance to save him.

618
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
 Let's go.

619
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
 Let's go, sir.

620
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
 Let's go.

621
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,240
 Oh, no.

622
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,240
 You guys.

623
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,240
 What do you want to do here?

624
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
 Akmi.

625
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
 We're here to save you.

626
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
 Save me?

627
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
 Yes, sir.

628
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
 Why?

629
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
 I'm fine here.

630
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
 I don't need to be saved.

631
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
 Don't run.

632
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,240
 Let me go.

633
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,240
 Hurry up and give her the medicine.

634
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
 Come on.

635
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
 Okay, sir.

636
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
 Let's continue.

637
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
 Hurry up.

638
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
 Come on.

639
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,240
 Let me go.

640
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
 Let me go.

641
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,240
 I don't want to drink your medicine.

642
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
 Let me go.

643
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
 I don't want to drink your medicine.

644
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
 Let me go.

645
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
 Calm down.

646
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
 Hurry up.

647
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
 Drink it.

648
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
 Drink it.

649
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:36,240
 How dare you to come here without my permission.

650
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
 You'll pay for it.

651
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:52,240
 Professor.

652
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,240
 We've got the first soul stone.

653
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,240
 We've got the second soul stone.

654
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
 But, next...

655
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,240
 we have to find the third soul stone.

656
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,240
 The question is...

657
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,240
 can we know where the third soul stone is?

658
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,240
 Unfortunately, until now...

659
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,240
 I haven't got the information where the third soul stone is.

660
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,240
 I'm dizzy.

661
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
 Calm down.

662
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
 I'll try to get the information.

663
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,240
 Professor, if you haven't got the information, can we...

664
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
 get one day's permission?

665
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
 Yes, because we still have something to do with Panji.

666
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
 Something to do with Panji?

667
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
 What is it?

668
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
 Don't be a pro.

669
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
 I'm not a pro.

670
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,240
 I'm just saying.

671
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:04,240
 I'll go now.

672
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
 Thank you.

673
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:15,240
 I'll go now.

674
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,240
 Yes!

675
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
 Finally, we've got the second soul stone.

676
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,240
 We have to work together.

677
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,240
 Now, I'm not dizzy anymore.

678
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,240
 What does zinc shrink to strength?

679
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,240
 But, we still have to get the tenth soul stone.

680
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
 But, we have to be motivated.

681
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,240
 We have to be motivated.

682
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
 That's right.

683
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,240
 Let's go to Panji's house.

684
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
 Okay.

685
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
 Hello, everyone.

686
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
 Mr. Panji.

687
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,240
 Mr. Panji, you scared me.

688
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
 You're a good boy, right?

689
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
 I'm a good boy.

690
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
 Mr. Panji, are you ready?

691
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,240
 Are you ready?

692
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,240
 We were going to invite you.

693
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
 What are you talking about?

694
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
 Don't go there.

695
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
 I'm not getting married.

696
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
 That's right, Mr. Panji.

697
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
 He's your husband.

698
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
 Yes.

699
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,240
 But, I was thinking...

700
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,240
 It's his business, not mine.

701
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
 Mr. Panji.

702
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 How do you do it?

703
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,240
 I'm not Panji if you can't do it.

704
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,240
 Mr. Panji.

705
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
 How is it?

706
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
 It's good.

707
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
 What are you doing?

708
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,240
 Be careful.

709
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:06,240
 Husband.

710
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
 Husband.

711
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:16,240
 Husband.

712
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:32,240
 Husband.

713
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
 Husband.

714
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:45,240
 This is the spirit of Panji.

715
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,240
 He's following the ghost.

716
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,240
 I'm following the ghost.

717
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
 I have to stop the ghost.

718
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,240
 So, I can find the other ghosts.

719
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

720
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

721
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

722
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

723
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

724
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

725
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

726
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

727
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

728
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

729
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

730
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

731
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

732
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

733
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
 I'm going to find the other ghosts.

734
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:46,240
 Your knowledge is useless.

735
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 You're all useless.

736
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,240
 Enough, Leon.

737
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
 You're the best.

738
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
 You're coming with me.

739
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
 Why are you in a magic school? You're useless.

740
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
 No.

741
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,240
 I don't want to be with a bad person like you.

742
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
 Enough.

743
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:12,240
 Your wish is my command.

744
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
 Release.

745
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
 Release.

746
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,240
 Release.

747
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
 Release.

748
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
 What's wrong?

749
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
 I'm going to kill you.

750
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
 What's wrong with you? Why did you want them?

751
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
 Don't.

752
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
 Because when I was in school,

753
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
 I was taught that we can't kill people.

754
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
 That's a sin.

755
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
 You can't, Mr. Erat.

756
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
 That's true.

757
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
 My teacher said that too.

758
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
 You know that's a sin, right?

759
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
 So, what should we do now?

760
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
 Calm down, Sir.

761
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
 We should make them...

762
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
 become your followers.

763
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
 So, there will be a lot of followers.

764
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
 Not just one or two people.

765
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,240
 You're right, Om Aki.

766
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
 If they all become my followers,

767
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,240
 our power will increase.

768
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,240
 You take care of everything.

769
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
 I'll take care of the rest.

770
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
 Del,

771
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
 let's go.

772
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
 Professor Rani,

773
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,240
 I know you won't hurt us.

774
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
 Come on.

775
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
 Drink this potion.

776
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
 Come on, Professor.

777
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
 Come on, Professor. Let's go.

778
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
 Yes, Professor.

779
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
 Drink it, Professor.

780
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,240
 So, Professor Ali can come home with us.

781
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
 I'm not going to be here.

782
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
 Professor Rani,

783
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
 come on.

784
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
 Drink this potion.

785
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
 Professor Ali!

786
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
 Rakif,

787
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
 you said you wanted to save us.

788
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
 Let go of me.

789
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
 Help us, Professor.

790
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
 We're in the wrong, Professor.

791
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
 Help us, Professor.

792
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,240
 I'm not the one who's going to drink this potion.

793
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
 You all are.

794
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:05,240
 Professor Ali,

795
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
 I told you, Aki.

796
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,240
 Don't let anyone touch you.

797
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,240
 My husband!

798
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:46,240
 My husband!

799
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,240
 My husband!

800
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,240
 My husband!

801
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,240
 My husband!

802
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,240
 My husband!

803
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
 What's going on?

804
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,240
 Welcome to Cinta Super's meeting.

805
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,240
 This meeting will make you all...

806
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,240
 obey whatever the government says.

807
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,240
 I'm not going to drink that potion.

808
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
 Yes, Professor.

809
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
 The director of the dark is evil.

810
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
 But you're not like him.

811
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
 You don't know that you're his followers.

812
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
 Yes, Professor.

813
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
 We're not a group.

814
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
 Shut up, all of you.

815
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
 It's useless for you to scream.

816
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,240
 If the dark is listening,

817
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
 you can all be punished.

818
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
 It's even worse.

819
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
 You're all going to the dark.

820
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
 Enough.

821
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
 Shut up.

822
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
 Don't make noise.

823
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
 Drink this now.

824
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
 Drink.

825
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
 I'm going to drink the Ramonito.

826
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,240
 I'm sorry, my dear.

827
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,240
 I attacked you first.

828
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
 Yes.

829
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,240
 If you win,

830
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,240
 I'll give you Ramona.

831
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
 But if I lose,

832
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,240
 you have to give me Ramona.

833
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,240
 Who's afraid?

834
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:36,240
 Why is your hair so short?

835
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
 Where's your hair?

836
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
 My hair is gone.

837
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,240
 You must have given your hair to someone else.

838
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,240
 To my husband.

839
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,240
 What husband?

840
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,240
 My husband.

841
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,240
 I told you.

842
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,240
 Don't give your hair to anyone.

843
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,240
 I'm sorry.

844
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,240
 Your mistake is fatal.

845
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
 I'm not sorry.

846
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:29,240
 I'm sorry.

847
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
 You've lost your hair.

848
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,240
 And you've made my soul broken.

849
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
 Feel this.

850
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
 Ouch.

851
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,240
 I'm sorry.

852
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,240
 What's wrong?

853
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,240
 You've been grumbling.

854
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:55,240
 I don't know.

855
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,240
 I don't feel good.

856
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,240
 What's wrong?

857
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,240
 I miss...

858
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,240
 My uncle.

859
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,240
 You miss him?

860
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
 Yes.

861
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,240
 I miss him.

862
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,240
 Don't be noisy.

863
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,240
 If you miss him,

864
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,240
 you have to come to him.

865
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
 That's enough.

866
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,240
 Finish your food.

867
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
 I feel sorry for Bargi.

868
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,240
 He's in the same class with his husband.

869
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
 Imagine if he's in the news.

870
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,240
 He can't imagine.

871
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,240
 But...

872
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,240
 But...

873
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,240
 Bargi must be heartbroken.

874
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,240
 His heart is broken.

875
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,240
 Shut up.

876
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
 I'm sorry.

877
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,240
 It's okay.

878
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:13,240
 What are you doing?

879
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
 You're a bully.

880
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
 Shut up.

881
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,240
 You're a bully.

882
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
 You're a bully.

883
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
 You're a bully.

884
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
 I'm going to hit you.

885
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
 It hurts.

886
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,240
 I'm sorry.

887
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
 It hurts.

888
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:46,240
 Who's that?

889
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
 I'm dead.

890
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,240
 Yes.

891
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,240
 If I get caught,

892
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,240
 I can't be caught.

893
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:18,240
 Teleport.

894
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
 I'm sorry.

895
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:27,240
 There's no one.

896
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,240
 Those kids.

897
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,240
 They're making me angry.

898
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:42,240
 It's better to be here.

899
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,240
 It's better to live a fresh life.

900
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
 I'm sorry.

901
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:58,240
 Ouch.

902
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,240
 What are you doing?

903
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
 Where are you from?

904
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,240
 Is this a school?

905
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
 Yes, it is.

906
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
 Yes.

907
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,240
 Thank God.

908
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
 I'm from the 8th Pangerang.

909
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,240
 Where are you from?

910
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,240
 I'm from the 8th Pangerang.

911
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
 The 8th Pangerang?

912
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
 Yes, the 8th Pangerang.

913
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,240
 I'm a bully.

914
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,240
 A bully?

915
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,240
 You met a bully?

916
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
 Yes.

917
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
 He was hit by a car.

918
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,240
 Yes.

919
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,240
 He asked for forgiveness.

920
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
 He asked for forgiveness.

921
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
 He was hurt.

922
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
 Where did it happen?

923
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
 In the forest.

924
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,240
 Get the lollipop.

925
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,240
 Fly.

926
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
 Don't do that.

927
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,240
 Because...

928
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,240
 he loves me.

929
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,240
 We can do this.

930
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:17,240
 We can do this.

931
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
 Bro, I must win.

932
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
 I must win.

933
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,240
 I must win.

934
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
 I must win.

935
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
 I must win.

936
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,240
 Bro, beat him.

937
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
 He's almost dead.

938
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
 Let's go.

939
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:43,240
 You're a bully.

940
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,240
 You're hurting my son.

941
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
 Get the lollipop.

942
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
 Beat him.

943
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,240
 Beat him.

944
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,240
 Beat him.

945
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,240
 Beat him.

946
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
 Beat him.

947
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,240
 I must win.

948
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,240
 Who wants to be a bully?

949
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:13,240
 Beat him.

950
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:21,240
 I must win.

951
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,240
 Beat him.

952
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,240
 Admit it, Agni.

953
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
 You lost.

954
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,240
 Now you must drink my wine.

955
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:41,240
 It's a deal.

956
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,240
 I want a drink.

957
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,240
 I want a drink.

958
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,240
 Thank you, Yana.

959
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,240
 Mr. Fahmi.

960
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
 I want a drink.

961
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:01,240
 You're a bully.

962
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,240
 You're a bully.

963
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:10,240
 Now you must drink my wine.

964
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,240
 It's a deal.

965
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,240
 You must drink my wine.

966
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
 I want a drink.

967
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:41,240
 Bargi.

968
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240
 I want a drink.

969
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
 The eighth call.

970
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:20,240
 You've gone too far.

971
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:30,240
 You deserve it.

972
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,240
 No.

973
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
 Don't.

974
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
 He's my professor.

975
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,240
 Don't give it to him.

976
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
 He's my professor.

977
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
 Shut up.

978
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,240
 No.

979
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,240
 I don't want it.

980
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
 Drink it.

981
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
 Drink it.

982
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:15,240
 Who made this?

983
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:23,240
 It's disgusting.

984
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,240
 This is my drink.

985
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,240
 I'm the one who made it.

986
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,240
 You're changing your behavior.

987
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,240
 Why?

988
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,240
 I'm not a good person?

989
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,240
 I'm not a good person?

990
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,240
 You're not doing your job.

991
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,240
 Because I'll make you...

992
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,240
 ...not a good person.

993
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
 Let me go.

994
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,240
 Ankara.

995
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,240
 Now...

996
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,240
 ...you should be a good sister.

997
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,240
 A sister who understands the school tradition.

998
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,240
 No, I don't want it.

999
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,240
 No.

1000
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,240
 Let me go.

1001
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,240
 Drink it.

1002
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,240
 So, I can be the only one who can help you.

1003
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,240
 Drink it.

1004
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
 Drink it.

1005
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,240
 Drink it.

1006
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,240
 Drink it.

1007
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:50,240
 Husband.

1008
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,240
 Husband.

1009
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,240
 I'm sorry, ma'am.

1010
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,240
 Because of me...

1011
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,240
 ...you're left by the prince.

1012
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,240
 Husband.

1013
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:13,240
 Give me the compress.

1014
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,240
 Give me the medicine.

1015
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:25,240
 Husband.

1016
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,240
 I have to clean his wound...

1017
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,240
 ...and cure him.

1018
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,240
 To be continued...

1019
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,240
 To be continued...

1020
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,240
 To be continued...

1021
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,240
 To be continued...

1022
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,240
 To be continued...

1023
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,240
 To be continued...

1024
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:15,240
 Suhami.

1025
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,240
 Bargi.

1026
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,240
 Why are you left by the dark shadow?

1027
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
 Bargi.

1028
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
 A traitor.

1029
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
 A traitor?

1030
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
 What kind of traitor?

1031
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:40,240
 Don't you dare to touch anyone's hair.

1032
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,240
 Do you understand?

1033
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,240
 I understand.

1034
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,240
 And if you touch anyone's hair...

1035
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,240
 ...I'll destroy you.

1036
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,240
 And your fate will be the same as Bargi's.

1037
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,240
 Yes, sir.

1038
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,240
 But...

1039
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,240
 ...if that's the case...

1040
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,240
 ...why did you give me your hair?

1041
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,240
 Because...

1042
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,240
 ...Bargi loves me.

1043
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,240
 Bargi is very tired.

1044
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,240
 Bargi wants to sleep.

1045
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,240
 No. Don't, Bargi.

1046
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,240
 Don't sleep.

1047
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,240
 Your wound is severe.

1048
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,240
 If you sleep, you'll get a bruise and you'll...

1049
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,240
 No. Just don't sleep. Okay?

1050
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,240
 Bargi is tired.

1051
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,240
 Bargi, I said don't sleep.

1052
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
 Okay.

1053
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,240
 Let's talk.

1054
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,240
 We'll talk about many things.

1055
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,240
 I'll accompany you. Just don't sleep. Okay?

1056
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,240
 Go to sleep.

1057
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:10,240
 Bargi?

1058
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,240
 Bargi?

1059
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,240
 Bargi, wake up.

1060
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,240
 Bargi?

1061
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,240
 I'll make you all...

1062
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,240
 ...fall in love with me.

1063
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:40,240
 Bargi! Wake up.

1064
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,240
 That's my uncle's voice.

1065
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,240
 Yes. Why did he call you?

1066
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,240
 Let's go.

1067
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,240
 Bargi!

1068
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,240
 What's wrong, uncle?

1069
01:00:53,240 --> 01:01:04,240
 Bargi! Wake up!

1070
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,240
 This is all my fault.

1071
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,240
 I caused Bargi to be like this.

1072
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,240
 I asked for his hair.

1073
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,240
 That's why Bargi was tortured by the 8th prince.

1074
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,240
 Oh, right. I read in a book...

1075
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,240
 ...that if a monster is in a bad condition...

1076
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,240
 ...there's only one way to revive it.

1077
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,240
 How, Fik?

1078
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,240
 The way is...

1079
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,240
 ...to kiss its penis.

1080
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,240
 Kiss?

1081
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,240
 That's right.

1082
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,240
 Let's kiss.

1083
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,240
 Come on, kiss it.

1084
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,240
 Kiss it.

1085
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,240
 Kiss it.

1086
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,240
 No, I can't.

1087
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
 I don't want to kiss it.

1088
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,240
 But, Uncle, you're upset, right?

1089
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,240
 I'm not.

1090
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
 You're upset, right?

1091
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,240
 Because Bargi is like this.

1092
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,240
 You're upset, right? Then, just kiss it.

1093
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,240
 Don't let Bargi die in vain.

1094
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,240
 Please, Uncle.

1095
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,240
 Please.

1096
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,240
 Okay.

1097
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,240
 I'll kiss it.

1098
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1099
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:47,240
 Bargi.

1100
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,240
 Bargi, you're awake.

1101
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1102
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,240
 What's wrong with Bargi?

1103
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,240
 Maybe it's true what I read in a book.

1104
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,240
 What's in the book?

1105
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
 What's that? A love story?

1106
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,240
 What's in the love story?

1107
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,240
 Guys, the monster that kissed the prince...

1108
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,240
 ...will become a beautiful princess.

1109
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1110
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,240
 Just like me, Berwi.

1111
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,240
 You're a monster, Bargi.

1112
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1113
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240

01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1118
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1119
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1120
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,240

01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1126
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,240
 Why isn't it a princess?

1127
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1128
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1129
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,240
 Why is it bigger than the world?

1130
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1131
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,240

 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1137
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,240
 Oh, right.

1138
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,240
 You think this is a storybook.

1139
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,240
 But it's a reality for kids.

1140
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1141
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,240
 Poor me.

1142
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,240
 Poor me.

1143
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,240
 I thought I'd get a beautiful wife.

1144
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,240
 But it turns out...

1145
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,240
 I'm a loser.

1146
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1147
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,240
 Poor me.

1148
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1149
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1150
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1151
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1152
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1153
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1154
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1155
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1156
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1157
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1158
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1159
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1160
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,240
 Professor Purwa?

1161
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1162
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1163
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,240
 Ankara?

1164
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,240
 Professor Purwa?

1165
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,240
 Why am I here?

1166
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1167
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1168
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1169
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1170
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,240
 I succeeded.

1171
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:27,240
 And I'm back to being the only one who pays the bill.

1172
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,240
 I don't have a competitor anymore.

1173
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,240
 (Bargi's penis is being removed)

1174
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,240
 Professor Purwa?

1175
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,240
 Why can we be with this creature?

1176
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,240
 You've won the love lottery.

1177
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,240
 You've become a follower of the 8th prince.

1178
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,240
 No, no, no way.

1179
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,240
 I don't want to be a follower of the 8th prince.

1180
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,240
 Agni, you can say that because you're aware

1181
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,240
 that you've done a lot of bad things.

1182
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:06,240
 Ankara, it's better if you let go of my hand.

1183
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,240
 No, that's impossible, Agni.

1184
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,240
 Because now, I'm going to make all of you

1185
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,240
 bow to the 8th prince.

1186
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,240
 (Bow to the 8th prince)

1187
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,240
 (Bow to the 8th prince)

1188
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
 (Bow to the 8th prince)

1189
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,240
 (Bow to the 8th prince)

1190
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,240
 (Bow to the 8th prince)

1191
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,240
 (Bow to the 8th prince)

1192
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,240
 Agni!

1193
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,240
 Agni, I'm home.

1194
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,240
 Bring me some food.

1195
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,240
 But that's the 8th prince's voice.

1196
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,240
 Why is he calling me?

1197
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
 I told you, Agni.

1198
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,240
 You've become a follower of the 8th prince.

1199
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,240
 Now, I'm going to report this.

1200
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,240
 He'll be very happy.

1201
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:57,240
 Watch out!

1202
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,240
 Sir, what's wrong?

1203
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,240
 Since when did you become Agni?

1204
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,240
 I called you Agni, why did you show up?

1205
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,240
 I'm your servant.

1206
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,240
 Oh, yes.

1207
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
 Ankara, you're in the discourse.

1208
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,240
 Why are you here?

1209
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,240
 Sir, please don't be angry.

1210
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,240
 I've apologized to you.

1211
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,240
 There's no more apology for you, Ankara.

1212
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,240
 I'm sick of being angry with you.

1213
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,240
 Sir, please understand me.

1214
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,240
 I can't not be your servant for a day.

1215
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,240
 So, please understand me.

1216
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,240
 I'll be your servant for the rest of my life.

1217
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,240
 I'll be your servant.

1218
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,240
 Sir, I have an extraordinary gift for you.

1219
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,240
 What gift?

1220
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,240
 When you left,

1221
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,240
 Purwa and some students from the magic school...

1222
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,240
 came to report you, sir.

1223
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,240
 What?

1224
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,240
 I don't know, sir.

1225
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,240
 I was lucky to see them.

1226
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,240
 What about Agni?

1227
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,240
 Agni is conscious, sir.

1228
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,240
 Because he was given a consultation by Purwa.

1229
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,240
 Agni is conscious?

1230
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:16,240
 But I managed to catch all of them, sir.

1231
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,240
 Including Agni.

1232
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,240
 And I've tied them up very tightly, sir.

1233
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,240
 So, they won't be able to get out.

1234
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:27,240
 And there will be many new candidates, sir.

1235
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,240
 (The next day)

1236
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:43,240
 I'm scared of lizards.

1237
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:54,240
 My husband.

1238
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,240
 What is it, Bargi?

1239
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:03,240
 Your hair is so smooth, Bargi.

1240
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:09,240
 I said no.

1241
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,240
 Bargi, don't ask.

1242
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,240
 You can't.

1243
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,240
 (The next day)

1244
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,240
 (The next day)

1245
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,240
 (The next day)

1246
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,240
 (The next day)

1247
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,240
 (The next day)

1248
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,240
 (The next day)

1249
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,240
 (The next day)

1250
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,240
 (The next day)

1251
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:42,240
 Chase your dreams

1252
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,240
 Go, go, go

1253
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,240
 Achieve all your dreams

1254
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,240
 Go, go, go

1255
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,240
 Never stop

1256
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,240
 Go, go, go

1257
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:56,240
 Fight with all your might

1258
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,240
 Go, go, go

1259
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,240
 Make yourself proud

1260
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,240
 Go, go, go

1261
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,240
 Let's dream

1262
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,240
 Go, go, go

1263
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,240
 We will

1264
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,360
 Bye bye..
