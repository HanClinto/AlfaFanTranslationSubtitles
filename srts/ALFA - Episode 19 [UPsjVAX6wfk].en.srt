Participants must dive to the bottom of the lake

15

When they arrive at the bottom of the lake, they must take a net that has been guarded by their tail

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Favorite, give it to me

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It means that for this first match, the winner is Alfa

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have to think about how I can beat Alfa

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If necessary, he can't participate in the next match

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know how

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Help

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The sound is around here

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But where?

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Help

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where are you?

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Open it

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Kids, the match will start in 15 minutes

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
For the participants, gather at the school's playground as soon as possible

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Where is Alfa? Why is he missing?

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where is Alfa? It's been a long time

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He must be eliminated, Alfa

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If Alfa doesn't come, what should I do?

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alfa must come

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hey, I'll look for Alfa for a moment

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where is Alfa?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I want to fight him

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Where is Alfa?

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The most dangerous

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why is there no one?

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's here

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Where is he?

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's almost there

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Damn it

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm your friend

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Calm down

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm your friend

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't you touch me

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Calm down

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sleep

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm your friend

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If you want to attack again, I can attack you back

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Look at this

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm your friend

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're my friend

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm your friend

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Tindara

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong?

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why can't I?

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't try to go inside

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's dangerous

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because there's a reptile inside

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Reptile?

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How can a reptile be in school?

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This reptile

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Actually, I caught it from the forest

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, it's still wild

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's very dangerous

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Calm down

73
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I heard a scary sound

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I heard a reptile inside

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's scary

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Listen

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The problem is

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm preparing a cage for the reptile

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, I'll put it in the cage for a while

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anyway

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Stay away from the cage

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't get close, it's dangerous

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is the food

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Really?

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's why

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We should go to the competition

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's starting

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Help

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Where are you?

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Help

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Help, don't eat me

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Alfa will be eliminated

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because she's late

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Professor Aldebaran

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's time

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We'll start now

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Kids

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The competition will start in five minutes

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
For the participants who are not here yet

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The participants will be eliminated

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Professor

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was playing in the dark

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In the dark?

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Really?

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes, I'm not lying

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I saw it in the mirror

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I looked for it, but I couldn't find it

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're a coward

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't be a coward

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're dreaming

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's true

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm not a coward

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm not dreaming

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not lying

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not a coward

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm just kidding

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't be mad

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Vega

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Maybe you're still traumatized by the dark

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So, keep thinking

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're stressed

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Instead of thinking about it

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You should ask Alfa

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, you'll be calm

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And happy

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And feel comfortable

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And feel strong

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Help

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Someone's coming

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey, Alfa

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Professor Titan

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Why are you so stupid?

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Like a cow eating a rice cake

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Go away

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Professor, I don't want to be helped

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's dangerous

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This kind of problem is so boring

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Go away

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're going to join the competition, right?

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I want to win

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Wait

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You need this

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
To win the competition

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For my feet?

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
For what?

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You'll understand the benefits

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay, professor

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you, professor

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's not here

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Where is he?

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is weird

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Where is Alfa?

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He's scared

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes, he's scared

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He's a king before the war

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Kids

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Now

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll start the countdown

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Five

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Four

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Three

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Two

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
One

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Hurray, Alfa is here

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you, professor

176
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Finally, you're here

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Where have you been?

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've been everywhere

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But, I'm tired

180
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have something to do

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Kids

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The competition will start soon

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The rule is

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Every participant

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Can get three feathers

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
From the queen

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Queen feather?

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How can I get it?

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
She doesn't like men

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Alfa, hold the door

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's stinging

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Kids

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is the magic door

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Every participant

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Who get in the magic door

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Will go to the queen's house

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's start

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
With the first participant

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Please, Rey

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Thank you, Rey

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Two

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Thank you

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You must be the queen

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The queen

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's her

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
How can I get the feather?

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Where is it?

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I know

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I got it

210
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's so hard

211
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
To get the feather

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's so hard

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I want

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The strawberry

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The red one

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The second participant

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The queen

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The third participant

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The queen

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm going to be a woman

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I got it

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I did it

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm the queen

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Who are you?

225
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm Rey

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't say that

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm Reyina

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You don't remember me

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm the one from that time

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Then, what are you doing here?

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I got lost

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can't go back to school

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If I get it, I'll get 30 angsa

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Poor you

235
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What should we do?

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We don't want to give our feathers

237
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Right?

238
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes

239
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What should we do?

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We can give it

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But, only for people

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Who can understand us

243
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But, how?

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's the secret

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Right, girls?

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's great

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm so happy

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I got it

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We got it

250
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We'll eat the vegetables

251
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why do we have to eat vegetables?

252
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We don't like it

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We're not ordinary

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Right?

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Right

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Girls

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We got it

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Why did you do that?

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How was it, Rey?

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's disgusting

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I got bit

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Calm down

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Because you didn't get the feather

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're disqualified

265
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Alfa, you have to succeed

266
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But, you have to trust us

267
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Right, Alfa?

268
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can't lose

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you get disqualified, I'll get it

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Rey and Alfa know that I like angsa

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If I knew it, I would have told Papi

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll win this time

273
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Now, it's the next contestant's turn

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Tommy, please

275
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Boss, we're going to get beaten

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
There's a man

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Attack!

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wait

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I have something for you

280
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Here

281
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Wait

282
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If you want to get the red flower

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You have to give three pieces of your angsa feather

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Three pieces of angsa feather

285
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Give me

286
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah!

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How was it, teachers?

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Is it real?

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
How was it, Professor Agni?

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Can you guarantee the authenticity?

291
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's real, Megantara

292
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's real, Professor

293
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's real, what should we do?

294
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You have to be able to do it

295
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Alfa, you have to win

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You can't lose to Tommy

297
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Now, it's the next contestant's turn

298
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Alfa, please

299
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Be careful, Alfa

300
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I heard it

301
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hi, everyone

302
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Lucky!

303
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's Alfa

304
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Are you here to ask for our feather, too?

305
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Like your friend

306
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Can I have it?

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Thank you, Mugtiara

309
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Give me

310
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Our feather is very precious

311
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't just give it away

312
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But I know you want to help her

313
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Sure

314
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
As long as she can pay with something worth it

315
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
To win the contest

316
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I have something

317
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We won!

318
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But Alfa, can you give us more?

319
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We still don't have enough

320
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We have 10

321
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I know

322
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I got it

323
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is a double camera

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If you take a picture, you'll get a lot of money

325
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Do you believe me?

326
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay, I'll try

327
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We won!

328
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Here you go

329
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We have 10

330
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We won!

331
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Alfa

332
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Hello

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Why are there so many balloons?

334
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I only said 3

335
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Alfa, this is a bonus for you

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because you made us happy

337
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Right, girls?

338
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Right!

339
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay

340
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you

341
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Why isn't Alfa here yet?

342
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's been so long

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm worried

344
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I know, it's been so long

345
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wait, Alfa will be here soon

346
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Alfa is great

347
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
She'll succeed

348
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Trust me

349
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Alfa won't win this time

350
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yes, she'll be the one to win

351
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We won!

352
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
How was it, Alfa?

353
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I didn't get it, Prof

354
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
See, Alfa didn't do anything

355
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Right

356
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You failed

357
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I have something

359
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Here's the proof

360
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
To prove the authenticity

361
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We'll give it to Prof. Akli

362
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Akli will investigate which one is fake and which one is real

363
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Please

364
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Alfa! Alfa! Alfa!

365
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
How was it, Prof. Agni?

366
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The real Megatron

367
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The real one?

368
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And the number is bigger than Tommy's

369
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And the number is bigger

370
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If that's the case

371
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
For the second match

372
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The winner is

373
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Alfa!

374
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Listen up, kids

375
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The third match

376
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Will be held in three days

377
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So, to the contestants

378
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Alfa and Tommy

379
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Get ready

380
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, sir

381
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Prof. Alfara, why are you here?

382
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We can do it

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's right

384
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Your opponent is me

385
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Prof. Alfa

386
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Die!

387
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This laptop

388
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Will be your son

389
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I will make good use of it

390
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Get the

391
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Stamper

392
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The stamper is your proof

393
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That you're mine

394
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Or not?

395
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm the one who will take it

396
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
How do you know which one is the real one?

397
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Is it Joker or Bunga?

398
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't know

399
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I want to give it to Prof. Titan

400
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Wow, that's cheating

401
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Why is it cheating?

402
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's cheating

403
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Prof. Titan gave you a stamp

404
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
He didn't give me a stamp

405
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
He only gave me a chocolate and a stamp

406
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He said it will be useful

407
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's the same

408
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Prof. Titan knows how to do it

409
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm tired of knowing

410
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Vega

411
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't be like that

412
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Prof. Titan is a good man

413
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
He's my teacher

414
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You too

415
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I was saved when I met Monster Raptor

416
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Monster Raptor?

417
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He's in the warehouse

418
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes

419
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I was trapped there

420
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Luckily Prof. Titan was there

421
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Or else

422
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I would have been a fool

423
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Alfa

424
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Come here

425
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm suspicious of Prof. Titan

426
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Why does he help Alfa all the time?

427
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
What does he mean?

428
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Alfa was helped by Prof. Titan

429
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
To get the chocolate and the flower

430
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Cheating!

431
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I know

432
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I have to make Alfa fight with Prof. Titan

433
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Then

434
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Alfa will get mad at Prof. Titan

435
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And then

436
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Alfa will be disqualified

437
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I will win

438
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yes

439
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What are you doing?

440
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You're the one who broke my heart

441
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What are you doing in my room?

442
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm in the toilet

443
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What about you?

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm in the bathroom

445
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm going to get hit by a tree

446
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Prof. Prof. Prof.

447
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Wait

448
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Tommy

449
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Someone wants to talk to me about Alfa

450
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What is it that you want to tell me?

451
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's very important

452
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I promise

453
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Prof. Krua and Prof. Aldebaran

454
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Will get mad

455
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Tell me

456
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
What is it?

457
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yesterday

458
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
During a competition

459
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I was in the toilet

460
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What's wrong with Alfa, Tommy?

461
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Tommy

462
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Tell me

463
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What's wrong with Alfa?

464
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Why is my voice like this?

465
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'll explain it

466
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Using sign language

467
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
(Alfa is trying to say something)

468
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I remind you, Tommy

469
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Don't play around

470
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Enough

471
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You're wasting my time

472
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
If you do this again

473
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You will get punishment

474
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Understand?

475
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You're wasting my time

476
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Why is my voice weird?

477
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Hello?

478
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Hi

479
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I forgot that Tommy is here

480
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Hi handsome

481
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I have a gift for you

482
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's done

483
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Chocolate

484
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Tommy, there's chocolate from me

485
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Why did you reject me?

486
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I know why you rejected me

487
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because of your teeth

488
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
God

489
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You're unfair

490
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You're cheating

491
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You helped Alfa

492
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'll tell Alfa and you to Albaran

493
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Wait

494
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Before we go

495
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'll show you something

496
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Come on, Tommy

497
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Tell me how to get rid of your teeth

498
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Come on

499
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Tommy

500
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I told you before

501
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Why are you telling me now?

502
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Think about it

503
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Tell me, P!

504
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you don't tell me, I'll scream

505
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Don't be noisy

506
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's why I'm telling you

507
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But

508
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll scream

509
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay

510
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'll tell you

511
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll bring you a rose

512
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And a heart-shaped chocolate

513
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Give it to the girl

514
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Give it to her

515
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay

516
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Look at me

517
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You don't have enough evidence

518
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
If I gave you a rose and a chocolate

519
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But if I showed you a picture of me to Aldebaran

520
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You'll be disqualified

521
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Don't tell Aldebaran, please

522
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay, Tommy

523
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I won't tell you

524
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But you have to stay still

525
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And we don't have to explain anything

526
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Just concentrate on the third test

527
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Okay, handsome?

528
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Damn it

529
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
[Titan's room]

530
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's Professor Titan

531
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Why is he standing in front of the warehouse?

532
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yes, sir

533
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Professor, why are you here?

534
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Ouch, it hurts

535
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Give him a lesson

536
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
[Titan's room]

537
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh my god, my dream is so scary

538
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But I'm getting more and more suspicious of Professor Titan

539
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Maybe he's related to the eighth dimension

540
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
If he uses a dream to change reality

541
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
He'll change soon

542
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
[Titan's room]

543
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So, what now?

544
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'll lose

545
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
If I lose, I'll be his opponent

546
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Tommy, don't be so harsh

547
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If people find out, it'll be dangerous

548
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But, I'm a puppy

549
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
If I join the competition, I'll have a hard time winning

550
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes, I'm confused too

551
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Your friend, Alfa, must be very smart

552
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You often give him a slip-up

553
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But you never win

554
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
No, Alfa is not smart

555
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Alfa is a coward

556
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
He can't keep losing

557
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So, I have to win this time

558
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
If not, I'll be a loser for a week

559
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Shh, don't do that

560
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Your puppy will get stressed

561
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That's why I have to win

562
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What's the punishment?

563
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't know

564
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, so you want me to lose?

565
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's okay, I'll feed you and drink you too

566
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Don't do that

567
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But, promise me

568
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If I tell you, you have to win

569
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Okay?

570
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Okay, I'll tell you

571
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Huh? A ghost?

572
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Professor Tim?

573
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's Professor Tim in the dark

574
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'll be attacked

575
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What? I just woke up from my dream

576
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Why are you laughing?

577
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I think my dream is a clue for me

578
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh, you're dreaming

579
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Don't be involved with real life

580
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yes, I'm a slanderer

581
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I often give him lollipop and chocolate

582
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I have a lot

583
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Hey, listen

584
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Don't believe what people say

585
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Remember this, Professor Angkara

586
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Professor Angkara?

587
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
He's nice to us

588
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Very nice

589
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But, he's a slanderer

590
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He's a slanderer, so he's a bad person

591
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So, I think

592
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Professor Tim has a connection with the ghost

593
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You're exaggerating

594
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
There's no good person like him

595
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
What's that? Slander?

596
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
No

597
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Professor Tim is a good person

598
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Right, Rik?

599
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yes

600
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Right, Rik?

601
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yes

602
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay, if you don't believe me

603
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll prove my words

604
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
What's that?

605
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Good morning, kids

606
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Good morning, Sir

607
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Why are you so down?

608
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Good morning, kids

609
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Good morning, Sir

610
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Okay

611
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Today's lesson is

612
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
History of Magic

613
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We're going to learn

614
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
About the magic of changing without knowing

615
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This magic is one of the highest black magic

616
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And

617
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's not time to be mastered by you

618
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What's the great thing about this magic?

619
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This magic can change someone's existence

620
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Into another person's existence

621
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The great thing about this magic

622
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Not only can it change another person's existence

623
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But it can also change the nature of the person

624
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That's why this magic is perfect for slander

625
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And it can last up to a year

626
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Sir

627
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Is there any weakness in this magic?

628
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yes

629
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Of course there is

630
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Then what is it?

631
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The weakness of this magic is

632
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Maybe some of you know what the weakness of this magic is

633
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Someone has to answer

634
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I don't know

635
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Where's Vega?

636
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He usually knows the answer

637
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Vega, what do you think the answer is?

638
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Look

639
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Where's Vega?

640
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
He's not here

641
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We're confused

642
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
He's not here

643
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm going to expose him

644
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Because I have to prove that

645
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Professor Titan is evil

646
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Hey

647
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
What are you doing?

648
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
No, Vega

649
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What are you doing?

650
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Why did you capture Professor Titan?

651
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
No

652
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Sorry, Professor

653
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I didn't mean to

654
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
If he uses a magic to change the world

655
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He'll change in a second

656
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
What's going on?

657
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Vega

658
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
What are we looking for?

659
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Why did you capture Professor Titan?

660
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Professor is scared, Vega

661
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Sorry, Professor

662
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's okay

663
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's okay, Professor

664
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You're smiling

665
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Professor, I have a gift for you

666
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:21,000
A Lollipop!

667
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Vega

668
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
This is a sweet Lollipop

669
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
For you, sweet Vega

670
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Thank you, Professor

671
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Professor, I'm going

672
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
He didn't change

673
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Did I get it wrong?

674
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
A Lollipop!

675
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But, where is Professor?

676
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A Lollipop!

677
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Mom

678
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's scary, someone's at the door

679
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We can do it

680
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Okay

681
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Since Vega is not here

682
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And none of you can answer

683
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
This magic weakness

684
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'll tell you

685
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This magic that changes the world

686
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The weakness is

687
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
A mirror

688
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, a mirror

689
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Why is the weakness a mirror, soldier?

690
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Because of the way it changes the world

691
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But without using magic

692
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Vega

693
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
What's wrong?

694
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Vega

695
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
What?

696
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You're such a good friend, but you didn't come in

697
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You're such a bad friend

698
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The lesson was so fun

699
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We were taught a magic that changes the world

700
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm sure you're upset that I didn't come in

701
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Stop it, you're so noisy

702
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm reading a magazine, don't disturb me

703
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Okay, let's read somewhere else

704
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You're so noisy

705
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That person is so weird

706
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Maybe he's crazy

707
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He's so sensitive

708
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
He's right, the ancient wizard said

709
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
If it's a girl

710
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
She's the most difficult creature to understand

711
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
No wonder

712
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Her name is girl

713
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
What?

714
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What's wrong, Captain?

715
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Can you come to my room after lunch?

716
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The professor will give you a private lesson

717
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
For free

718
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
How's that?

719
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I want to, sir

720
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You're so cute

721
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
The professor has a gift for you

722
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
A chocolate

723
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
This is a chocolate from the professor for you

724
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And for you, Rey

725
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Thank you, sir

726
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You're so kind

727
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You're welcome

728
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I told you, I have a gift

729
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I can't let you take it away

730
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Raptor

731
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
This is your favorite food

732
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Come out

733
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Raptor

734
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,000
This is an example of a cheap food

735
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Come on, Raptor

736
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Don't hide

737
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Come out

738
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Hi, Raptor

739
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Come out

740
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Eat all you want, Raptor

741
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But remember, Raptor

742
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I have a mission for you tomorrow

743
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Raptor

744
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Come on, eat

745
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I can't wait to read the book

746
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm going to the room

747
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
The professor is leaving

748
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm going to the room

749
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yes, someone's here

750
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm going to check the room

751
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:53,000
What's that?

752
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What's in there?

753
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Why is it locked?

754
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
What's in there?

755
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'll just open it

756
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm going to the room

757
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Mom

758
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
There's someone at the door

759
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh, Alfa's here

760
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
She thought I was Professor Titan

761
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'll just go out

762
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I'd better not go out

763
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
She'll be mad if she finds out I'm studying her favorite book

764
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Alfa saw Mari too

765
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm sure Alfa will suspect Mari's secret

766
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Be patient, B. B. Centaurus

767
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You'll be expelled

768
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
If you're expelled, Professor Titan will be finished

769
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Be patient, B. B. Centaurus

770
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
There's a kid in this room

771
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I have to tell her

772
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I know you must be bored there

773
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Right?

774
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Be patient, B. You'll be expelled

775
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Be patient

776
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Hey, Alfa

777
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Professor

778
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
What are you doing here?

779
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Professor, B. B. Centaurus is making a fuss

780
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
He's making a fuss

781
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Or maybe he wants to be expelled

782
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
He's bored

783
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Don't worry, Alfa

784
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'll take B. B. Centaurus out to play

785
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Play?

786
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Now, I'll give you a magic spell

787
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's useful to catch ghosts

788
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Ghosts?

789
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Have you ever seen a ghost?

790
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Are you scared?

791
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
No, I've seen one

792
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Great, Alfa!

793
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You can catch ghosts?

794
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Yes, Professor. Ghosts are transparent

795
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I can catch them when they're dense

796
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's right, Alfa

797
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So, Professor will teach you this dense magic

798
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Alfa, look at this ghost

799
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Now, Professor will catch it

800
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Power of the Dark!

801
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Alfa, look

802
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I've caught the ghost

803
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Now, you can try

804
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
[Dense Magic]

805
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Alfa, look

806
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Sorry, Professor

807
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I didn't mean to

808
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I must free myself

809
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Since there's a kid in this room

810
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's okay, Alfa

811
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Now, you can try again

812
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
No, Professor

813
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
He's kind

814
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
He even taught me a new magic spell

815
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So, I was wrong

816
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
[Dense Magic]

817
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:02,000
A, B, C!

818
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
What's that noise?

819
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:22,000
[We can do it]

820
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Professor

821
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I did it!

822
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Good job, Alfa

823
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Thank you, Professor

824
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You're welcome

825
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Help!

826
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm the real Professor Tita

827
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Help!

828
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
[Dense Magic]

829
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We're in the wrong house

830
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You're evil!

831
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You're cunning!

832
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Let me go!

833
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
A, B, C!

834
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
What's that noise?

835
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's from Professor Tita's room

836
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Maybe he's training with Miss Sentaurus

837
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm going with you, Miss

838
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm in a hurry

839
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
[Dense Magic]

840
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Kids

841
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's time for the final match

842
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Between Alfa and Tommy

843
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Alfa! Tommy! Alfa!

844
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Calm down, kids

845
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Wait a minute

846
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Alfa and Tommy

847
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
You have to ride your bike into the forest

848
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And you have to catch a ghost

849
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
A ghost?

850
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
That's scary!

851
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
After you catch the ghost

852
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You have to bring it to the finish line

853
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And when you get there

854
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You have to run and get the prize

855
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The first one to get the prize

856
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Will be the winner

857
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Alfa and Tommy, are you ready?

858
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yes, Professor

859
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
One

860
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Two

861
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Three!

862
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Where is he?

863
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
He wants to catch us

864
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It's been a while

865
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'm on standby, I can catch him

866
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Where is he?

867
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:05,000
There he is

868
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
He can't catch me

869
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm a coward

870
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That's Alfa

871
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yes, that's Alfa

872
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
She's the one who made me lose my faith in life

873
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I will make her lose

874
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Guys

875
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
You better hide

876
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Don't show up in front of the magic school kid

877
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
His name is Alfa

878
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Don't we have to show up?

879
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
What should we do?

880
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
One more is okay

881
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
But the one named Alfa

882
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Can't be there, got it?

883
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
But?

884
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
No buts

885
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Just follow me

886
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
No, we don't want to

887
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
We want to see Alfa

888
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That's it

889
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Over there, at the bar

890
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Over there

891
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You're done, Alfa

892
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You won't get the ghost

893
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And you will lose

894
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Alfa, I'll go right, you go left

895
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Let's see who gets the ghost first

896
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You're not watching the competition?

897
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
There's something more important than the competition

898
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
What is it?

899
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm going to the gym

900
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
There's something more important than the competition

901
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
What is it, Vega?

902
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Professor Titan

903
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
What about him?

904
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Professor Titan, who's been in our school

905
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
He's a fake

906
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Bye, Alfa

907
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Don't come in

908
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
You're done, Alfa

909
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
The ghost is already hiding

910
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You won't get the ghost

911
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I'm going to the gym

912
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Show your spirit, get ready

913
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Find your friends

914
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Run, jump, and climb

915
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Beat the beat

916
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Be brave

917
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Don't give up

918
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Chase your dreams

919
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,360
[Go, go, go, get all of your dreams]

920
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,760
[Go, go, go, never stop]

921
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,620
[Go, go, go, fight with your heart]

922
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:04,060
[Go, go, go, make yourself proud]

923
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,460
[Go, go, go, let's dream]

924
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,260
[Go! Go! Go! We will win!]
