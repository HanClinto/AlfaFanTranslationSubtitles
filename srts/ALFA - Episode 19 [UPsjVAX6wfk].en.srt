 To be continued...

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000

 To be continued...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, prepare it, friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, we

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Dare, don't know, say, give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase, hope, and dreams

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with the power of the heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Participants must dive to the bottom of the lake

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 When they arrive at the bottom of the lake, they must take a net that has been guarded by their tail

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Favorite, give it to me

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It means that for this first match, the winner is Alva

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I have to think about how I can beat Alva

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 If necessary, he can't participate in the next match

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I know how

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Help

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 The sound is around here

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But where?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Help

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Hey

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Where are you?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Hey

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Open it

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Open it

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Kids, the match will start in 15 minutes

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 For the participants, gather at the school's playground as soon as possible

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Where is Alva? Why is he missing?

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Where is Alva? It's been a long time

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 He must be eliminated, Alva

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 If Alva doesn't come, what should I do?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Alva must come

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Hey, I'll look for Alva for a moment

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Where is Alva?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I want to fight him

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Where is Alva?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 The most dangerous

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Why is there no one?

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 He's here

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 He's here

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Where is he?

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 He's almost there

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Damn it

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I'm your friend

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Calm down

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I'm your friend

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I'm your friend

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Don't you touch me

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Calm down

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Sleep

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I'm your friend

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 If you want to attack again, I can attack you back

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Look at this

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I'm your friend

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I'm your friend

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 You're my friend

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'm your friend

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Don't

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Tindara

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 What's wrong?

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Why can't I?

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Don't try to go inside

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It's dangerous

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Because there's a reptile inside

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Reptile?

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 How can a reptile be in school?

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Yes

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 This reptile

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Actually, I caught it from the forest

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So, it's still wild

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 It's very dangerous

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Calm down

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I heard a scary sound

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I heard a reptile inside

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's scary

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Listen

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 The problem is

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I'm preparing a cage for the reptile

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 So, I'll put it in the cage for a while

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Anyway

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Stay away from the cage

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Don't get close, it's dangerous

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 This is the food

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Really?

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 That's why

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 We should go to the competition

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Okay

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's starting

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Let's go

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 No

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Help

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Where are you?

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Help

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Help, don't eat me

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Alva will be eliminated

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Because she's late

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Professor Aldebaran

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It's time

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Okay

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 We'll start now

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Kids

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 The competition will start in five minutes

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 For the participants who are not here yet

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 The participants will be eliminated

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Professor

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I was playing in the dark

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 In the dark?

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Really?

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Yes, I'm not lying

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I saw it in the mirror

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I looked for it, but I couldn't find it

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 You're a coward

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Don't be a coward

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 You're dreaming

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 It's true

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I'm not a coward

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I'm not dreaming

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I'm not lying

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I'm not a coward

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I'm just kidding

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Don't be mad

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Vega

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Maybe you're still traumatized by the dark

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So, keep thinking

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 What are you talking about?

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 You're stressed

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Instead of thinking about it

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 You should ask Alva

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 So, you'll be calm

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And happy

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And feel comfortable

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And feel strong

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Okay

142
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Let's go

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Help

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Someone's coming

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Hey, Alva

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Professor Titan

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Why are you so stupid?

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Like a cow eating a rice cake

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Go away

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Professor, I don't want to be helped

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 It's dangerous

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 This kind of problem is so boring

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Go away

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 You're going to join the competition, right?

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Yes

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I want to win

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Wait

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You need this

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 To win the competition

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 For my feet?

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yes

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 For what?

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 You'll understand the benefits

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Okay, professor

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Thank you

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Thank you, professor

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 He's not here

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Where is he?

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 This is weird

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Where is Alva?

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 He's scared

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Yes, he's scared

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 He's a king before the war

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Kids

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Now

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I'll start the countdown

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Five

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Four

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Three

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Two

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 One

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Hurray, Alva is here

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Thank you, professor

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Finally, you're here

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Where have you been?

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I've been everywhere

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 But, I'm tired

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I have something to do

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Kids

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 The competition will start soon

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 The rule is

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Every participant

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Can get three feathers

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 From the queen

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Queen feather?

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 How can I get it?

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 She doesn't like men

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Alva, hold the door

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's stinging

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Kids

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 This is the magic door

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Every participant

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Who get in the magic door

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Will go to the queen's house

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Let's start

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 With the first participant

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Please, Rey

208
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Thank you, Rey

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Two

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Thank you

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 You must be the queen

212
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 The queen

213
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 That's her

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 How can I get the feather?

215
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Where is it?

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I know

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I got it

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It's so hard

219
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 To get the feather

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It's so hard

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I want

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 The strawberry

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 The red one

224
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 The second participant

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 The queen

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 The third participant

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 The queen

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I'm going to be a woman

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I got it

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I did it

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I'm the queen

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Who are you?

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I'm Rey

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Don't say that

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'm Reyina

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 You don't remember me

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 I'm the one from that time

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Then, what are you doing here?

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I got lost

240
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I can't go back to school

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 If I get it, I'll get 30 angsa

242
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Poor you

243
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 What should we do?

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 We don't want to give our feathers

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Right?

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Yes

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 What should we do?

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 We can give it

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But, only for people

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Who can understand us

251
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 But, how?

252
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 That's the secret

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Right, girls?

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 That's great

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I'm so happy

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I got it

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 We got it

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 We'll eat the vegetables

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Why do we have to eat vegetables?

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 We don't like it

261
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 We're not ordinary

262
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Right?

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Right

264
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Girls

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 We got it

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 We got it

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Why did you do that?

268
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 How was it, Rey?

269
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 It's disgusting

270
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I got bit

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Calm down

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Because you didn't get the feather

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 You're disqualified

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 You're disqualified

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 You're disqualified

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Alva, you have to succeed

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 But, you have to trust us

278
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Right, Alva?

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 You can't lose

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 If you get disqualified, I'll get it

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Rey and Alva know that I like angsa

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 If I knew it, I would have told Papi

283
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I'll win this time

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Now, it's the next contestant's turn

285
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Tommy, please

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Boss, we're going to get beaten

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 There's a man

288
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Attack!

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Wait

290
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I have something for you

291
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Here

292
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Wait

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 If you want to get the red flower

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 You have to give three pieces of your angsa feather

295
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Three pieces of angsa feather

296
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Three pieces of angsa feather

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Give me

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Yeah!

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 How was it, teachers?

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Is it real?

301
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 How was it, Professor Agni?

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Can you guarantee the authenticity?

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 It's real, Megantara

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 It's real, Professor

305
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It's real, what should we do?

306
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 You have to be able to do it

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Alva, you have to win

308
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 You can't lose to Tommy

309
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Now, it's the next contestant's turn

310
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Alva, please

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Be careful, Alva

312
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I heard it

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Hi, everyone

314
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Lucky!

315
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 That's Alva

316
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Are you here to ask for our feather, too?

317
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Like your friend

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Yes

319
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Can I have it?

320
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Thank you, Mugtiara

321
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Give me

322
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Our feather is very precious

323
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Don't just give it away

324
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 But I know you want to help her

325
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Sure

326
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 As long as she can pay with something worth it

327
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 To win the contest

328
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I have something

329
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I have something

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 We won!

331
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 We won!

332
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 We won!

333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 We won!

334
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 We won!

335
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 But Alva, can you give us more?

336
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 We still don't have enough

337
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 We have 10

338
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I know

339
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 I got it

340
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 This is a double camera

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 If you take a picture, you'll get a lot of money

342
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Do you believe me?

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Okay, I'll try

344
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 We won!

345
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 We won!

346
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 We won!

347
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 We won!

348
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 We won!

349
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 We won!

350
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Here you go

351
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 We have 10

352
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 We won!

353
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 We won!

354
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 We won!

355
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 We won!

356
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We won!

357
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 We won!

358
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 We won!

359
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 We won!

360
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 We won!

361
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 We won!

362
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 We won!

363
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 We won!

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Alva

365
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Hello

366
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Why are there so many balloons?

367
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I only said 3

368
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Alva, this is a bonus for you

369
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Because you made us happy

370
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Right, girls?

371
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Right!

372
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Okay

373
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Thank you

374
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Why isn't Alva here yet?

375
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 It's been so long

376
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I'm worried

377
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I know, it's been so long

378
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Wait, Alva will be here soon

379
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Alva is great

380
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 She'll succeed

381
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Trust me

382
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Alva won't win this time

383
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Yes, she'll be the one to win

384
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 We won!

385
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 How was it, Alva?

386
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 I didn't get it, Prof

387
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 See, Alva didn't do anything

388
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Right

389
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 You failed

390
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 But

391
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I have something

392
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Here's the proof

393
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 To prove the authenticity

394
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 We'll give it to Prof. Akli

395
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Akli will investigate which one is fake and which one is real

396
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Please

397
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Alva! Alva! Alva!

398
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 How was it, Prof. Agni?

399
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 The real Megatron

400
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 The real one?

401
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And the number is bigger than Tommy's

402
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And the number is bigger

403
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 If that's the case

404
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 For the second match

405
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 The winner is

406
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Alva!

407
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Listen up, kids

408
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 The third match

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Will be held in three days

410
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So, to the contestants

411
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Alva and Tommy

412
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Get ready

413
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Yes, sir

414
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Prof. Alvara, why are you here?

415
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 We can do it

416
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 We can do it

417
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 That's right

418
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Your opponent is me

419
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Prof. Alva

420
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Die!

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Die!

422
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 This laptop

423
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Will be your son

424
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I will make good use of it

425
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Get the

426
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Stamper

427
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 The stamper is your proof

428
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 That you're mine

429
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Or not?

430
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 I'm the one who will take it

431
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 How do you know which one is the real one?

432
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Is it Joker or Bunga?

433
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I don't know

434
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 I want to give it to Prof. Titan

435
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Wow, that's cheating

436
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Why is it cheating?

437
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 It's cheating

438
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Prof. Titan gave you a stamp

439
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He didn't give me a stamp

440
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He only gave me a chocolate and a stamp

441
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 He said it will be useful

442
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 It's the same

443
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Prof. Titan knows how to do it

444
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I'm tired of knowing

445
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Vega

446
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Don't be like that

447
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Prof. Titan is a good man

448
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 He's my teacher

449
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 You too

450
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I was saved when I met Monster Raptor

451
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Monster Raptor?

452
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He's in the warehouse

453
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Yes

454
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I was trapped there

455
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Luckily Prof. Titan was there

456
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Or else

457
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I would have been a fool

458
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Alva

459
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Come here

460
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Come here

461
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 I'm suspicious of Prof. Titan

462
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Why does he help Alva all the time?

463
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 What does he mean?

464
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Alva was helped by Prof. Titan

465
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 To get the chocolate and the flower

466
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Cheating!

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Cheating!

468
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I know

469
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 I have to make Alva fight with Prof. Titan

470
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Then

471
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Alva will get mad at Prof. Titan

472
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And then

473
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Alva will be disqualified

474
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 I will win

475
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Yes

476
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Yes

477
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 What are you doing?

478
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 What are you doing?

479
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 You're the one who broke my heart

480
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 What are you doing in my room?

481
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 I'm in the toilet

482
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 What about you?

483
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I'm in the bathroom

484
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 I'm going to get hit by a tree

485
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Prof. Prof. Prof.

486
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Wait

487
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Tommy

488
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Someone wants to talk to me about Alva

489
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 What is it that you want to tell me?

490
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 It's very important

491
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 I promise

492
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Prof. Krua and Prof. Aldebaran

493
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Will get mad

494
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Tell me

495
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 What is it?

496
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Yesterday

497
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 During a competition

498
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I was in the toilet

499
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 What's wrong with Alva, Tommy?

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Tommy

501
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Tell me

502
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 What's wrong with Alva?

503
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Why is my voice like this?

504
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 I'll explain it

505
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Using sign language

506
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 (Alva is trying to say something)

507
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I remind you, Tommy

508
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Don't play around

509
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Enough

510
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 You're wasting my time

511
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 If you do this again

512
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 You will get punishment

513
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Understand?

514
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 You're wasting my time

515
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Why is my voice weird?

516
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Hello?

517
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Hi

518
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I forgot that Tommy is here

519
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Hi handsome

520
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I have a gift for you

521
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 It's done

522
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Chocolate

523
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Tommy, there's chocolate from me

524
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Why did you reject me?

525
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 I know why you rejected me

526
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Because of your teeth

527
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 God

528
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 You're unfair

529
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 You're cheating

530
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 You helped Alva

531
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 I'll tell Alva and you to Albaran

532
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Wait

533
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Before we go

534
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I'll show you something

535
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Come on, Tommy

536
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Tell me how to get rid of your teeth

537
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Come on

538
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Tommy

539
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 I told you before

540
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Why are you telling me now?

541
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Think about it

542
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Tell me, P!

543
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 If you don't tell me, I'll scream

544
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Don't be noisy

545
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 That's why I'm telling you

546
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 But

547
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 I'll scream

548
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Okay

549
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 I'll tell you

550
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 I'll bring you a rose

551
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 And a heart-shaped chocolate

552
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Give it to the girl

553
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Give it to her

554
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Okay

555
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Look at me

556
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 You don't have enough evidence

557
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 If I gave you a rose and a chocolate

558
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 But if I showed you a picture of me to Aldebaran

559
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 You'll be disqualified

560
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Don't tell Aldebaran, please

561
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Okay, Tommy

562
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 I won't tell you

563
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 But you have to stay still

564
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And we don't have to explain anything

565
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Just concentrate on the third test

566
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Okay, handsome?

567
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Damn it

568
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 [Titan's room]

569
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 That's Professor Titan

570
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Why is he standing in front of the warehouse?

571
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Yes, sir

572
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Professor, why are you here?

573
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Ouch, it hurts

574
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Give him a lesson

575
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 [Titan's room]

576
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Oh my god, my dream is so scary

577
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 But I'm getting more and more suspicious of Professor Titan

578
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Maybe he's related to the eighth dimension

579
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 If he uses a dream to change reality

580
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 He'll change soon

581
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 [Titan's room]

582
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 [Titan's room]

583
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 So, what now?

584
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 I'll lose

585
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 If I lose, I'll be his opponent

586
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Tommy, don't be so harsh

587
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 If people find out, it'll be dangerous

588
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 But, I'm a puppy

589
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 If I join the competition, I'll have a hard time winning

590
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Yes, I'm confused too

591
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Your friend, Alva, must be very smart

592
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 You often give him a slip-up

593
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 But you never win

594
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 No, Alva is not smart

595
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Alva is a coward

596
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 He can't keep losing

597
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 So, I have to win this time

598
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 If not, I'll be a loser for a week

599
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Shh, don't do that

600
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Your puppy will get stressed

601
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 That's why I have to win

602
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 What's the punishment?

603
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 I don't know

604
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Oh, so you want me to lose?

605
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 It's okay, I'll feed you and drink you too

606
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Don't do that

607
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 But, promise me

608
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 If I tell you, you have to win

609
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Okay?

610
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Okay, I'll tell you

611
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Huh? A ghost?

612
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Professor Tim?

613
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 It's Professor Tim in the dark

614
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I'll be attacked

615
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 What? I just woke up from my dream

616
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Why are you laughing?

617
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 I think my dream is a clue for me

618
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Oh, you're dreaming

619
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Don't be involved with real life

620
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Yes, I'm a slanderer

621
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 I often give him lollipop and chocolate

622
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 I have a lot

623
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Hey, listen

624
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Don't believe what people say

625
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Remember this, Professor Angkara

626
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Professor Angkara?

627
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 He's nice to us

628
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Very nice

629
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 But, he's a slanderer

630
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 He's a slanderer, so he's a bad person

631
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 So, I think

632
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 Professor Tim has a connection with the ghost

633
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 You're exaggerating

634
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 There's no good person like him

635
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 What's that? Slander?

636
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 No

637
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Professor Tim is a good person

638
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Right, Rik?

639
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Yes

640
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Right, Rik?

641
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Yes

642
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Okay, if you don't believe me

643
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 I'll prove my words

644
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 What's that?

645
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Good morning, kids

646
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Good morning, Sir

647
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Why are you so down?

648
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Good morning, kids

649
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Good morning, Sir

650
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Okay

651
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Today's lesson is

652
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 History of Magic

653
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 We're going to learn

654
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 About the magic of changing without knowing

655
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 This magic is one of the highest black magic

656
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 And

657
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 It's not time to be mastered by you

658
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 What's the great thing about this magic?

659
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 This magic can change someone's existence

660
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Into another person's existence

661
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 The great thing about this magic

662
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Not only can it change another person's existence

663
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 But it can also change the nature of the person

664
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 That's why this magic is perfect for slander

665
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 And it can last up to a year

666
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Sir

667
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Is there any weakness in this magic?

668
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 Yes

669
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Of course there is

670
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 Then what is it?

671
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 The weakness of this magic is

672
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Maybe some of you know what the weakness of this magic is

673
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Someone has to answer

674
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 I don't know

675
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Where's Vega?

676
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 He usually knows the answer

677
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Vega, what do you think the answer is?

678
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Look

679
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Where's Vega?

680
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 He's not here

681
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 He's not here

682
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 He's not here

683
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 We're confused

684
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 We're confused

685
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 He's not here

686
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 I'm going to expose him

687
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Because I have to prove that

688
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 Professor Titan is evil

689
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Hey

690
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 What are you doing?

691
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 No, Vega

692
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 What are you doing?

693
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Why did you capture Professor Titan?

694
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 No

695
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Sorry, Professor

696
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 I didn't mean to

697
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 If he uses a magic to change the world

698
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 He'll change in a second

699
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 What's going on?

700
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Vega

701
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 What are we looking for?

702
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Why did you capture Professor Titan?

703
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Professor is scared, Vega

704
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Sorry, Professor

705
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 It's okay

706
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 It's okay, Professor

707
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 You're smiling

708
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Professor, I have a gift for you

709
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 A Lollipop!

710
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Vega

711
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 This is a sweet Lollipop

712
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 For you, sweet Vega

713
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Thank you, Professor

714
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Professor, I'm going

715
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 He didn't change

716
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 Did I get it wrong?

717
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 A Lollipop!

718
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 But, where is Professor?

719
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 A Lollipop!

720
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 Mom

721
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 It's scary, someone's at the door

722
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 We can do it

723
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 We can do it

724
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 We can do it

725
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Okay

726
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 Since Vega is not here

727
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 And none of you can answer

728
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 This magic weakness

729
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 I'll tell you

730
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 This magic that changes the world

731
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 The weakness is

732
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 A mirror

733
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 Oh, a mirror

734
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Why is the weakness a mirror, soldier?

735
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Because of the way it changes the world

736
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 But without using magic

737
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 Vega

738
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 What's wrong?

739
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Vega

740
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 What?

741
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 You're such a good friend, but you didn't come in

742
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 You're such a bad friend

743
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 The lesson was so fun

744
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 We were taught a magic that changes the world

745
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 I'm sure you're upset that I didn't come in

746
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Stop it, you're so noisy

747
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 I'm reading a magazine, don't disturb me

748
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Okay, let's read somewhere else

749
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 You're so noisy

750
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 That person is so weird

751
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Maybe he's crazy

752
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 He's so sensitive

753
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 He's right, the ancient wizard said

754
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 If it's a girl

755
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 She's the most difficult creature to understand

756
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 No wonder

757
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 Her name is girl

758
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 What?

759
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 What's wrong, Captain?

760
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 Can you come to my room after lunch?

761
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 The professor will give you a private lesson

762
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 For free

763
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 How's that?

764
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 I want to, sir

765
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 You're so cute

766
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 The professor has a gift for you

767
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 A chocolate

768
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 This is a chocolate from the professor for you

769
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 And for you, Rey

770
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 Thank you, sir

771
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 You're so kind

772
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 You're welcome

773
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 I told you, I have a gift

774
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 I can't let you take it away

775
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 Raptor

776
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 Raptor

777
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 This is your favorite food

778
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Come out

779
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 Raptor

780
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 This is an example of a cheap food

781
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Come on, Raptor

782
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Don't hide

783
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 Come out

784
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 Hi, Raptor

785
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 Come out

786
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 Eat all you want, Raptor

787
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 But remember, Raptor

788
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 I have a mission for you tomorrow

789
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Raptor

790
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Come on, eat

791
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 I can't wait to read the book

792
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 I'm going to the room

793
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 The professor is leaving

794
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 I'm going to the room

795
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 Yes, someone's here

796
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 I'm going to check the room

797
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 What's that?

798
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 What's in there?

799
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 Why is it locked?

800
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 What's in there?

801
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 I'll just open it

802
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 I'll just open it

803
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 I'm going to the room

804
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 I'm going to the room

805
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 I'm going to the room

806
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 Mom

807
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 There's someone at the door

808
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 Oh, Alva's here

809
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 She thought I was Professor Titan

810
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 I'll just go out

811
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 I'd better not go out

812
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 She'll be mad if she finds out I'm studying her favorite book

813
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 Alva saw Mari too

814
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 I'm sure Alva will suspect Mari's secret

815
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 Be patient, B. B. Centaurus

816
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 You'll be expelled

817
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 If you're expelled, Professor Titan will be finished

818
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 Be patient, B. B. Centaurus

819
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 Be patient, B. B. Centaurus

820
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 There's a kid in this room

821
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 I have to tell her

822
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 I know you must be bored there

823
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 Right?

824
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 Be patient, B. You'll be expelled

825
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 Be patient

826
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 Hey, Alva

827
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Professor

828
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 What are you doing here?

829
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 Professor, B. B. Centaurus is making a fuss

830
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 He's making a fuss

831
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Or maybe he wants to be expelled

832
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 He's bored

833
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Don't worry, Alva

834
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 I'll take B. B. Centaurus out to play

835
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 Play?

836
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 Now, I'll give you a magic spell

837
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 It's useful to catch ghosts

838
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 Ghosts?

839
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 Have you ever seen a ghost?

840
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 Are you scared?

841
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 No, I've seen one

842
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 Great, Alva!

843
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 You can catch ghosts?

844
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 Yes, Professor. Ghosts are transparent

845
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 I can catch them when they're dense

846
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 That's right, Alva

847
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 So, Professor will teach you this dense magic

848
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 Alva, look at this ghost

849
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 Now, Professor will catch it

850
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 Power of the Dark!

851
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Alva, look

852
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 I've caught the ghost

853
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 Now, you can try

854
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 [Dense Magic]

855
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 Alva, look

856
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 Sorry, Professor

857
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 I didn't mean to

858
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 I must free myself

859
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 Since there's a kid in this room

860
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 It's okay, Alva

861
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 Now, you can try again

862
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 No, Professor

863
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 He's kind

864
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 He even taught me a new magic spell

865
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 So, I was wrong

866
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 [Dense Magic]

867
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 A, B, C!

868
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 What's that noise?

869
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 [We can do it]

870
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 [We can do it]

871
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 Professor

872
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 I did it!

873
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 Good job, Alva

874
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 Thank you, Professor

875
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 You're welcome

876
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 Help!

877
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 I'm the real Professor Tita

878
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 Help!

879
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 [Dense Magic]

880
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 We're in the wrong house

881
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 You're evil!

882
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 You're cunning!

883
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 Let me go!

884
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 A, B, C!

885
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 What's that noise?

886
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 It's from Professor Tita's room

887
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 Maybe he's training with Miss Sentaurus

888
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 I'm going with you, Miss

889
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 I'm in a hurry

890
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 [Dense Magic]

891
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 Kids

892
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 It's time for the final match

893
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 Between Alva and Tommy

894
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 Alva! Tommy! Alva!

895
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
 Calm down, kids

896
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 Wait a minute

897
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 Alva and Tommy

898
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 You have to ride your bike into the forest

899
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 And you have to catch a ghost

900
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 A ghost?

901
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 That's scary!

902
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 After you catch the ghost

903
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 You have to bring it to the finish line

904
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 And when you get there

905
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 You have to run and get the prize

906
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 The first one to get the prize

907
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 Will be the winner

908
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 Alva and Tommy, are you ready?

909
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 Yes, Professor

910
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 One

911
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 Two

912
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 Three!

913
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 Where is he?

914
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 He wants to catch us

915
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 It's been a while

916
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 I'm on standby, I can catch him

917
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 Where is he?

918
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 Where is he?

919
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 There he is

920
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 He can't catch me

921
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 I'm a coward

922
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 That's Alva

923
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 Yes, that's Alva

924
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 She's the one who made me lose my faith in life

925
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 I will make her lose

926
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 Guys

927
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 You better hide

928
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 Don't show up in front of the magic school kid

929
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 His name is Alva

930
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 Don't we have to show up?

931
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
 What should we do?

932
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 One more is okay

933
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 But the one named Alva

934
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 Can't be there, got it?

935
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 But?

936
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 No buts

937
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 Just follow me

938
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 No, we don't want to

939
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 We want to see Alva

940
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 That's it

941
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 Over there, at the bar

942
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 Over there

943
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 You're done, Alva

944
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 You won't get the ghost

945
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 And you will lose

946
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 Alva, I'll go right, you go left

947
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Let's see who gets the ghost first

948
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 You're not watching the competition?

949
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 There's something more important than the competition

950
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
 What is it?

951
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 I'm going to the gym

952
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 I'm going to the gym

953
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 There's something more important than the competition

954
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 What is it, Vega?

955
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
 Professor Titan

956
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 What about him?

957
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
 Professor Titan, who's been in our school

958
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 He's a fake

959
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 Bye, Alva

960
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
 Don't come in

961
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 You're done, Alva

962
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 The ghost is already hiding

963
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 You won't get the ghost

964
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 I'm going to the gym

965
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 I'm going to the gym

966
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 Show your spirit, get ready

967
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 Find your friends

968
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
 Run, jump, and climb

969
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 Beat the beat

970
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 Be brave

971
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 Don't give up

972
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams

973
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,360
 [Go, go, go, get all of your dreams]

974
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,760
 [Go, go, go, never stop]

975
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,620
 [Go, go, go, fight with your heart]

976
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:04,060
 [Go, go, go, make yourself proud]

977
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,460
 [Go, go, go, let's dream]

978
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,260
 [Go! Go! Go! We will win!]
