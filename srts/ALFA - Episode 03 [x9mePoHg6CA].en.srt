1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Show your spirit, get your friends ready

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Chase your hopes and dreams

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What is this?

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Barga is a monster that is not human

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He is a hand and leg monster

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That can defeat him

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Only the dark lord and a kid

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Who is he?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alpha

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Night, Nan

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Before the sun sets

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You have to go back to the secret room

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And get the eternal stone for me

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you doing out there?

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When can I kill you?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ouch

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ray

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How did you know?

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You were unconscious

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was unconscious

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But because of you

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I got this disease

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let me try using a mantra

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Dangdut Dapang

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why is it dangdut?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Maybe you got the mantra wrong

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Dapat Tangtangdu

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is it

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come on, Ray

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's working

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Dapang

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry, Ray

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:52,000

45
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
How do I catch him?

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400

Oh my God!

50
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I can't find the antidote!

51
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Oh my God!

52
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,400
What kind of poison is this?

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
This is poison from the Three Heads.

54
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
What? Three Heads?

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Oh my God!

56
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,400
The Three Heads poison has no antidote.

57
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,400
You better go to Megantara now.

58
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
What do you mean?

59
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Captain Megantara.

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Because his guardian is Megantara.

61
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Hurry!

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Okay, I'll go to Megantara now.

63
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Go!

[laughing]

75
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,400
They're beautiful girls now.

76
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Vega, now it's your turn.

77
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
You have to approach them.

78
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,400
You have to figure out how to get them to the clinic to get their kidneys treated.

79
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Why me? I already know them. I want to be a soldier.

80
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Here's the problem.

81
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,400
They're not into men.

82
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,400
They're not into men like me.

83
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm handsome.

84
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
They'll get allergic.

85
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Don't think too much.

86
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Do you want to be a doctor?

87
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Come here.

Hey, who are you?

90
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Did you call us here?

91
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Yes, I did.

92
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I really need your help.

93
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
My friend is a third-ranked soldier.

94
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,400
You're the only one who can treat my friend.

95
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Why do we have to help you? We don't even know you.

96
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Why are you saying that? Please, help me.

97
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,400
I promise I'll do everything you want.

What do you want to do?

101
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,400
I don't know.

102
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Okay, if you want to do what we want, you have to make us happy and laugh.

103
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,400
But how?

104
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Think about it. We haven't laughed in a while. Right, girls?

105
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
That's right.

106
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
It won't take long. I'll count to three.

107
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Or we'll leave.

108
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,400
How?

109
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
One.

Shh.

112
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Wait.

113
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Follow me. I'll make you laugh.

114
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
I can do it. Please, believe me.

115
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Come on.

116
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Let's go.

Oh, no.

123
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
It's a man.

124
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm not a man. How are you?

125
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,400
You said you're tired of men.

126
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
What are you waiting for? Just shoot him.

127
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Friga, don't.

128
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400

So, now, please tell me.

156
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Why are you in that room?

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400

This is so annoying.

Alfa doesn't need that stone.

I managed to get the stone.

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Professor Agni asked me to.

195
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Because this school is in danger.

196
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Only that stone can save this school.

197
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Alfa, I never asked you to take that stone.

198
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,400
But yesterday afternoon, Professor Agni asked me to take the Stone of Eternity.

199
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
No, Alfa. I never asked you to take that stone.

200
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
[music playing]

201
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Professor.

202
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
The Stone of Eternity is...

203
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,400
[music playing]

204
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
The three heads of the dragon are all fighting.

205
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:48,400
[music playing]

206
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Alfa.

207
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
How did you know all this?

208
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Professor Agni, Professor...

209
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Professor Agni told me.

210
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,400
And Professor Agni also told me about the food of the three heads of the dragon.

211
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Alfa.

212
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I never and never asked you to do all that.

213
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Yes, Professor.

214
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:23,400
[music playing]

215
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:41,400
[roar]

216
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Alfa.

217
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Now you should go back to your dormitory.

218
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
But, Professor.

219
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
I really gave the stone to Professor Agni.

220
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
And after that, I don't know what else.

221
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
It seems like someone chased me until I fainted.

222
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I never received anything from you, Alfa.

223
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
That's impossible, Professor.

224
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I can't be lying.

225
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Here's the thing, Alfa.

226
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
The stone can't save this school.

227
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
On the contrary,

228
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
if the stone falls into the wrong hands,

229
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
this school could be in danger.

230
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
For example, the 8th Prince.

231
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
[roar]

232
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
[music playing]

233
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
The 8th Prince?

234
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
What's going on?

235
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
You shouldn't be hearing that name.

236
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
And you don't need to know who he is.

237
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Based on your son's behavior,

238
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
a thief,

239
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
you should have just taught him at school.

240
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Enough.

241
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Now, go back to your dormitory.

242
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Go.

243
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
I'm sorry, Professor.

244
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
This time, you're really naughty, Alfa.

245
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
You went into that room,

246
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
and then you took the stone to the abyss.

247
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
The stone was gone.

248
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,400
And you lied again when you were asked by Professor Agni.

249
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
But, Tentara, I didn't lie.

250
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I don't believe it.

251
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
How can you believe it?

252
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Professor Agni has been a teacher at this school for decades, Alfa.

253
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
So, it's impossible for him to lie.

254
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
But, I'm telling the truth, Tentara.

255
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
I'm not lying.

256
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Tentara,

257
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
who's that Dark Lord?

258
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,400
That Dark Lord?

259
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,400
You don't know the time yet, Alfa.

260
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,400
What's clear is that this Dark Lord is very dangerous, Alfa.

261
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Not a single person hopes that he will return.

262
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
[DARK LORD]

263
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Rey,

264
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
you're back!

265
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Rey, I know everything.

266
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
If you're not here, I'm not going to be able to save you.

267
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
You took the stone to the abyss,

268
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
and you lied.

269
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
You said Professor Agni asked you to do it.

270
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
But, you didn't.

271
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Now, you're denying it.

272
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Is that true or not?

273
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
No, Rey.

274
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
That's a lie.

275
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
I gave the stone to Professor Agni.

276
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
And suddenly, someone came after me.

277
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
And I don't know what happened.

278
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Oh, really?

279
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
But, you don't believe it.

280
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Vega, you don't believe me either.

281
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
[DARK LORD]

282
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Alright.

283
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
If you don't believe me, it's okay.

284
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
I'll prove it to you later.

285
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
If what I said is true.

286
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Oh, he's the one who's angry.

287
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I should be the one who's angry.

288
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I've been poisoned.

289
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
But, I'm just a victim of a php.

290
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
I think he's not wrong, Rey.

291
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
What do you mean?

292
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Professor Agni lied?

293
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
That's right.

294
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Hey, guys.

295
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
You've heard it, right?

296
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Alfa is a thief.

297
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,400
She stole the stone from Mr. Dian.

298
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
How could a thief be allowed to enter this school?

299
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Right.

300
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Let's go.

301
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:58,400
It turns out that Klepto is not only shameless.

302
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
He's already a thief.

303
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
But, he still dares to show up here.

304
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Guys.

305
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,400
It's not fun if there's a thief in our school.

306
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I have an idea.

307
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
We have to make a petition, guys.

308
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
What do you think?

309
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Do you agree?

310
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,400
A petition to be banned.

311
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:50,400
[Petition to be banned]

312
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Petition, it's been canceled.

313
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Wow.

314
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
There are so many people.

315
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,400
If this continues, Malik will be expelled from this school.

316
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Right, guys?

317
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Right.

318
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
[Petition to be banned]

319
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Alfa.

320
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Come here.

321
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Hurry up.

322
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Come here.

323
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
What are you doing?

324
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Come here.

325
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,400
What are you doing?

326
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
You're so annoying, Alfa.

327
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Alfa has betrayed us.

328
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Alfa is a good person.

329
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,400
The proof is that he saved me from the thieves.

330
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,400
A good person like Alfa can't do that.

331
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I'm sure he's being trapped now.

332
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
And he's in a trap.

333
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Come on, he's a rat.

334
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Listen.

335
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I don't want to be poisoned anymore.

336
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
If you want to help Alfa, go there.

337
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
I want to sleep.

338
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Hey.

339
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Alfa said he was trapped in front of the forbidden room.

340
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I think I need to investigate that room.

341
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Just in case there's any evidence left there.

342
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
[The forbidden room]

343
00:30:45,400 --> 00:31:11,400
What's that?

344
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
[The forbidden room]

345
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Ouch, it hurts.

346
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,400
What's wrong with me?

347
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Hey, don't go there.

348
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
[The forbidden room]

349
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Sir.

350
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Why is this room sealed?

351
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
It wasn't like this yesterday.

352
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Yes, because Alfa was in this room yesterday.

353
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,400
And this is a very forbidden room.

354
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
That's why this room is sealed with a spell.

355
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
So, no one can enter.

356
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
And you.

357
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Don't you dare to enter this room.

358
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Do you understand?

359
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
I'll go first.

360
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:17,400
If the spell is used to open the door,

361
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,400
then the door can also be opened with a spell.

362
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I have to find a spell to open this door.

363
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
[The forbidden room]

364
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Now, no one believes me.

365
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Tentara.

366
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Ray.

367
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
And Vega.

368
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
They think I'm lying.

369
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
But I don't have any evidence.

370
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,400
And I don't know where the body switch is.

371
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Hi, bro.

372
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Why are you smiling?

373
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Do you believe me?

374
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Yes.

375
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Here, a magic spell from me.

376
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Take it.

377
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
You take one.

378
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Thank you.

379
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
You're welcome.

380
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Open it.

381
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Is it good?

382
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:48,400
I told you it's not good.

383
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
You're right.

[The magic spell]

385
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Why is your voice like this?

386
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:13,400
It's so funny.

387
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
I got it.

388
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,400
What Jack gave me is a voice changer.

389
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,400
So, for the next two hours,

390
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
your voice will change into an animal's voice.

391
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:41,400
That's a lesson.

392
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Let's go.

393
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,400
You're expelled from school.

[The magic spell]

395
00:34:50,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Never say a magic spell in front of the mirror.

396
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Because the spell will come back to you.

397
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
For that,

398
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,400
there's a magic spell you can use.

399
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
You have to say this spell...

400
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,400
before you say the one you want to say.

401
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Repeat after me.

402
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:39,400

403
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Once again.

404
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Javangan Pantung.

405
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Alfa.

406
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Why don't you repeat your spell?

407
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Do you think you're smart?

408
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Why are you just standing there?

409
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Come on.

410
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Repeat the spell.

411
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:28,400
You're insulting me, Alfa.

412
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Shut up!

413
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,400
You're too much, Alfa.

414
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
For that, you'll be punished.

415
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:52,400
I'm sorry.

416
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Attention, everyone.

417
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
All students, gather in the classroom.

418
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Once again.

419
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Attention, everyone.

420
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,400
All students, gather in the classroom.

421
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Alfa's School

422
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:18,400
What is the important thing that needs to be discussed...

423
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
until I have to leave my class?

424
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,400
What steps should we take against Alfa?

425
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I think that should not be discussed anymore.

426
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Alfa should be expelled.

427
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Alfa's School

428
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Expelling a student from the school...

429
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
is not an easy task.

430
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,400
But, Professor.

431
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
What Alfa has done...

432
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
is beyond the limits.

433
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
If we don't expel her...

434
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
we can protest against her...

435
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
by her parents.

436
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
That's right.

437
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Three days until the full moon.

438
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,400
And if in the full moon...

439
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,400
the darkness of darkness gets her stone...

440
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,400
she will get an unlimited power...

441
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
that will destroy this world.

442
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,400
And all of that will happen to Alfa.

443
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Professor.

444
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Just now, at the break time...

445
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,400
some students gave me this petition.

446
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,400
The petition states that...

447
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
all the students in this school...

448
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
agree to expel Alfa from this school.

449
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
It seems...

450
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,400
we have no other choice, Professor.

451
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Alfa has to be expelled from this school.

453
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Call Alfa.

454
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Tell her to come here.

455
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Luckily, my voice is back.

456
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
If not...

457
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Professor Aldebaran will be angry.

458

459
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Why did you call me?

460
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:47,400
Good morning, Professor.

461
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
The words you will hear...

462
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
will not be pleasant to the ears.

463
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,400
But you have to listen to them.

464
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Why, Professor?

465
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,400

really take the stone?

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
What?

571
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,400
How can she sleep here?

572
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
What's wrong?

573
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
She's having a nightmare.

574
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,400
[The kids are having a nightmare]

575
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Ri, wake up!

576
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
Ri!

577
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,400
What's wrong?

578
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Alfa, Ri!

579
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
Alfa was kicked out of the school.

580
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
Come on, hurry up!

581
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Alfa was kicked out?

582
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,400
Let's ask the teacher.

583
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Yes.

584
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,400
The news you heard is true.

585
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Alfa is being taken to the lake by the school's police.

586
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,400
I'm the one who's wrong.

587
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
I was mean to Alfa.

588
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,400
She told me about the punishment.

589
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
But I didn't want to hear it.

590
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,400
You're too much.

591
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,400
You're not sensitive at all.

592
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Everyone says that.

593
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Even if I'm handsome, I'm not sensitive.

594
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Why?

595
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,400
But, Alfa is innocent.

596
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,400
We have to make her go back to school.

597
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
But we don't have any evidence.

598
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
You're talking nonsense.

599
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
We can't make a solid evidence.

600
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,400
But we have to investigate it together.

601
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,400
And Alfa is a soldier's friend.

602
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
How can a soldier be so confident...

603
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
...to see his own friend who's innocent...

604
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,400
...but being punished so severely?

605
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Alfa, you're in charge now.

606
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,400
This boat will take you back.

607
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Alfa, you're in charge now.

608
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,400
This boat will take you back.

609
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:29,400
I'm going back.

610
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
Goodbye, Vega.

611
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Goodbye, Rey.

612
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,400
I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

613
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,400
But if I do, they'll be mad at me.

614
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
They hate me.

615
00:49:49,400 --> 00:50:01,400
What's going on?

616
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:22,400
You've been expelled from this school.

617
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,400
Why are you still here?

618
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,400
I know who stole the stone.

619
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Who?

620
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Professor Tuluak.

621
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
I'll prove that I'm right.

622
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Just wait and see.

623
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Let's go!

624
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,400
Don't let the stone...

625
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,400
...be given to the 8th Prince.

626
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,400
There are two of them.

627
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Two?

628
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Show your spirit, get ready...

629
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
...my friend.

630
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Run, jump, and conquer...

631
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
...the stars.

632
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Be brave, don't give up.

633
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Chase your dreams.

634
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams.

635
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,400
Go, go, go, never stop.

636
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:41,400
Go, go, go, fight with all your might.

637
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,400
Go, go, go, make yourself proud.

638
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Go, go, go, let's dream.

639
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,400
Go, go, go, we'll make it.

640
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,120
D'yiii!
