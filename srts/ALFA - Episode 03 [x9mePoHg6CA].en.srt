 Show your spirit, get your friends ready

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Be brave, don't give up

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Chase your hopes and dreams

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 What is this?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Barga is a monster that is not human

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 He is a hand and leg monster

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 That can defeat him

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Only the dark lord and a kid

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Who is he?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Alpha

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Night, Nan

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Before the sun sets

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 You have to go back to the secret room

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And get the eternal stone for me

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 What are you doing out there?

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 When can I kill you?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Ouch

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000

 Ray

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 How did you know?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 You were unconscious

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I was unconscious

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But because of you

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I got this disease

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Let me try using a mantra

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Dangdut Dapang

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Why is it dangdut?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I don't know

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Maybe you got the mantra wrong

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Yes

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Dapat Tangtangdu

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 This is it

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Come on, Ray

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 It's working

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I'm sorry, Ray

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000

 I can't find the antidote!

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
 Oh my God!

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,400
 What kind of poison is this?

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
 This is poison from the Three Heads.

86
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
 What? Three Heads?

87
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
 Oh my God!

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,400
 The Three Heads poison has no antidote.

89
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,400
 You better go to Megantara now.

90
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 What do you mean?

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
 Captain Megantara.

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
 Because his guardian is Megantara.

93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 Hurry!

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
 Okay, I'll go to Megantara now.

 Vega, now it's your turn.

 You have to approach them.

160
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,400
 You have to figure out how to get them to the clinic to get their kidneys treated.

 Why me? I already know them. I want to be a soldier.

 Here's the problem.

163
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 They're not into men.

164

 They're not into men like me.

 I'm handsome.

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 They'll get allergic.

 Yes, I did.

 I really need your help.

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
 My friend is a third-ranked soldier.

176
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,400
 You're the only one who can treat my friend.

177
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,400
 Why do we have to help you? We don't even know you.

178
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,400
 Why are you saying that? Please, help me.

179
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 I promise I'll do everything you want.

 I don't know.

184
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,400
 Okay, if you want to do what we want, you have to make us happy and laugh.

185
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,400
 But how?

186
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,400
 Think about it. We haven't laughed in a while. Right, girls?

187
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
 That's right.

188
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
 It won't take long. I'll count to three.

189
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
 Or we'll leave.

190
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,400
 How?

191
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
 One.

192
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
 Two.

193
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
 Shh.

194
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
 Wait.

195
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 Follow me. I'll make you laugh.

196
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
 I can do it. Please, believe me.

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:26,400
 Come on.

198
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 Let's go.

199
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,400
 [clock ticking]

200
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,400
 You're quite good at this. One problem solved.

201
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
 [laughing]

202
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,400
 [music playing]

203
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
 Sorry, soldier.

204
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
 Oh, no.

205
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
 It's a man.

206
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,400
 I'm not a man. How are you?

207
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,400
 You said you're tired of men.

208
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 What are you waiting for? Just shoot him.

209
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
 Friga, don't.

210
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
 Attack.

211
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,400
 [fighting]

212
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
 [laughing]

213
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
 Don't.

214
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
 [laughing]

217
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,400
 Yes, yes, yes. We are party.

218
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,400
 [cheering]

219
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
 [laughing]

220
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
 I made you laugh.

221
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
 Now, help me.

222
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
 Yes.

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 Yes, yes, we are party.

234
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
 I'm so happy.

235
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,400
 [laughing]

236
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
 Let me see.

237
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
 Let me see.

238
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,400
 [music playing]

239
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
 So, now, please tell me.

240
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
 Why are you in that room?

241
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 So, it's like this.

242
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
 Alva said...

243
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,400
 this school is in danger.

244
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 And he needs that stone to save this school.

245
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,400
 If not, many girls will be threatened.

246
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,400
 This is so annoying.

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,400
 Alva doesn't need that stone.

248
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
 What is he doing?

249
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
 Where is Alva now?

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
 No, no, no.

257
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
 I'm going to kill Buca.

258
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 Hey.

259
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
 What are you doing in there?

260
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,400
 Alva.

261
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,400
 Ma'am.

262
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
 How is it, Alva?

263
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,400
 Yes, ma'am. I managed to get the stone.

264
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,400
 [music playing]

265
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
 Excuse me.

 For the next two hours, your voice will change into a dog's voice.

282
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
 Ma'am.

283
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 I've handed over the stone.

284
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 So, this school is safe, right?

285
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 [music playing]

286
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
 What do you mean, Alva?

287
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
 I managed to get the stone.

288
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
 And I gave it to the professor, right?

289
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 [music playing]

290
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
 I never asked you to do that.

291
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
 Alva.

292
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
 Why did you take the stone?

293
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
 Professor Agni asked me to.

294
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
 Because this school is in danger.

295
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
 Only that stone can save this school.

296
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
 Alva, I never asked you to take that stone.

297
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 But yesterday afternoon, Professor Agni asked me to take the Stone of Eternity.

298
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 No, Alva. I never asked you to take that stone.

299
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 [music playing]

300
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
 Professor.

301
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
 The Stone of Eternity is...

302
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 [music playing]

303
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
 The three heads of the dragon are all fighting.

 [music playing]

305
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
 Alva.

306
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
 How did you know all this?

307
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
 Professor Agni, Professor...

308
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
 Professor Agni told me.

309
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,400
 And Professor Agni also told me about the food of the three heads of the dragon.

310
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
 Alva.

311
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
 I never and never asked you to do all that.

312
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
 Yes, Professor.

313
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:23,400
 [music playing]

314
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,400
 [roar]

315
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
 [roar]

316
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:38,400
 [roar]

317
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,400
 [roar]

318
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,400
 Alva.

319
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
 Now you should go back to your dormitory.

320
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 But, Professor.

321
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
 I really gave the stone to Professor Agni.

322
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
 And after that, I don't know what else.

323
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
 It seems like someone chased me until I fainted.

324
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
 I never received anything from you, Alva.

325
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
 That's impossible, Professor.

326
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
 I can't be lying.

327
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
 Here's the thing, Alva.

328
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 The stone can't save this school.

329
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
 On the contrary,

330
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
 if the stone falls into the wrong hands,

331
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 this school could be in danger.

332
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
 For example, the 8th Prince.

333
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
 [roar]

334
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
 [music playing]

335
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
 The 8th Prince?

336
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
 The 8th Prince?

337
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
 What's going on?

338
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 You shouldn't be hearing that name.

339
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
 And you don't need to know who he is.

340
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
 Based on your son's behavior,

341
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
 a thief,

342
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
 you should have just taught him at school.

343
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
 Enough.

344
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
 Now, go back to your dormitory.

345
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
 Go.

346
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
 I'm sorry, Professor.

347
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 This time, you're really naughty, Alva.

348
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
 You went into that room,

349
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
 and then you took the stone to the abyss.

350
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
 The stone was gone.

351
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,400
 And you lied again when you were asked by Professor Agni.

352
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
 But, Tentara, I didn't lie.

353
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
 I don't believe it.

354
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
 How can you believe it?

355
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,400
 Professor Agni has been a teacher at this school for decades, Alva.

356
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 So, it's impossible for him to lie.

357
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
 But, I'm telling the truth, Tentara.

358
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
 I'm not lying.

359
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
 Tentara,

360
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
 who's that Dark Lord?

361
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,400
 That Dark Lord?

362
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,400
 You don't know the time yet, Alva.

363
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,400
 What's clear is that this Dark Lord is very dangerous, Alva.

364
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,400
 Not a single person hopes that he will return.

365
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
 [DARK LORD]

366
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:04,400
 Rey,

367
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
 you're back!

368
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:14,400
 Rey, I know everything.

369
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
 If you're not here, I'm not going to be able to save you.

370
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
 You took the stone to the abyss,

371
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
 and you lied.

372
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
 You said Professor Agni asked you to do it.

373
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 But, you didn't.

374
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
 Now, you're denying it.

375
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
 Is that true or not?

376
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
 No, Rey.

377
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
 That's a lie.

378
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
 I gave the stone to Professor Agni.

379
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
 And suddenly, someone came after me.

380
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
 And I don't know what happened.

381
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
 Oh, really?

382
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 But, you don't believe it.

383
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
 Vega, you don't believe me either.

384
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
 [DARK LORD]

385
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:56,400
 Alright.

386
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
 If you don't believe me, it's okay.

387
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
 I'll prove it to you later.

388
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
 If what I said is true.

389
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:13,400
 Oh, he's the one who's angry.

390
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
 I should be the one who's angry.

391
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
 I've been poisoned.

392
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 But, I'm just a victim of a php.

393
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
 I think he's not wrong, Rey.

394
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 What do you mean?

395
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
 Professor Agni lied?

396
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
 That's right.

397
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,400
 Hey, guys.

398
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
 You've heard it, right?

399
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
 Alva is a thief.

400
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,400
 She stole the stone from Mr. Dian.

401
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 How could a thief be allowed to enter this school?

402
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
 Right.

403
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
 Let's go.

404
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:58,400
 It turns out that Klepto is not only shameless.

405
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
 He's already a thief.

406
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
 But, he still dares to show up here.

407
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,400
 Guys.

408
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,400
 It's not fun if there's a thief in our school.

409
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
 I have an idea.

410
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
 We have to make a petition, guys.

411
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 What do you think?

412
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
 Do you agree?

413
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,400
 A petition to be banned.

414
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
 [Petition to be banned]

415
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
 [Petition to be banned]

416
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:40,400
 [Petition to be banned]

417
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:48,400
 [Petition to be banned]

418
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
 [Petition to be banned]

419
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,400
 Petition, it's been canceled.

420
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,400
 Wow.

421
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
 There are so many people.

422
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,400
 If this continues, Malik will be expelled from this school.

423
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
 Right, guys?

424
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
 Right.

425
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
 [Petition to be banned]

426
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:37,400
 Alva.

427
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
 Come here.

428
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
 Hurry up.

429
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 Come here.

430
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
 What are you doing?

431
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
 Come here.

432
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,400
 What are you doing?

433
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
 You're so annoying, Alva.

434
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
 Alva has betrayed us.

435
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
 Alva is a good person.

436
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 The proof is that he saved me from the thieves.

437
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,400
 A good person like Alva can't do that.

438
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
 I'm sure he's being trapped now.

439
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
 And he's in a trap.

440
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
 Come on, he's a rat.

441
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 Listen.

442
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
 I don't want to be poisoned anymore.

443
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
 If you want to help Alva, go there.

444
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
 I want to sleep.

445
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
 Hey.

446
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:36,400
 Alva said he was trapped in front of the forbidden room.

447
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
 I think I need to investigate that room.

448
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,400
 Just in case there's any evidence left there.

449
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
 [The forbidden room]

450
00:30:45,400 --> 00:31:11,400
 What's that?

451
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
 [The forbidden room]

452
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:24,400
 Ouch, it hurts.

453
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,400
 What's wrong with me?

454
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,400
 Hey, don't go there.

455
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
 [The forbidden room]

456
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 Sir.

457
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,400
 Why is this room sealed?

458
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
 It wasn't like this yesterday.

459
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 Yes, because Alva was in this room yesterday.

460
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,400
 And this is a very forbidden room.

461
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
 That's why this room is sealed with a spell.

462
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 So, no one can enter.

463
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
 And you.

464
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,400
 Don't you dare to enter this room.

465
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
 Do you understand?

466
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
 I'll go first.

467
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:17,400
 If the spell is used to open the door,

468
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,400
 then the door can also be opened with a spell.

469
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 I have to find a spell to open this door.

470
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
 [The forbidden room]

471
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:48,400
 Now, no one believes me.

472
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,400
 Tentara.

473
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
 Ray.

474
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
 And Vega.

475
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
 They think I'm lying.

476
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
 But I don't have any evidence.

477
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,400
 And I don't know where the body switch is.

478
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,400
 Hi, bro.

479
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
 Why are you smiling?

480
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
 Do you believe me?

481
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
 Yes.

482
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 Here, a magic spell from me.

483
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
 Take it.

484
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
 You take one.

485
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 Thank you.

486
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
 You're welcome.

487
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
 Open it.

488
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:39,400
 Is it good?

489
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:48,400
 I told you it's not good.

490
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 You're right.

491
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
 [The magic spell]

492
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:05,400
 Why is your voice like this?

493
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:13,400
 It's so funny.

494
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
 I got it.

495
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,400
 What Jack gave me is a voice changer.

496
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,400
 So, for the next two hours,

497
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
 your voice will change into an animal's voice.

498
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:41,400
 That's a lesson.

499
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
 Let's go.

500
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,400
 You're expelled from school.

501
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
 [The magic spell]

502
00:34:50,400 --> 00:35:10,400
 Never say a magic spell in front of the mirror.

503
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
 Because the spell will come back to you.

504
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
 For that,

505
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,400
 there's a magic spell you can use.

506
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
 You have to say this spell...

507
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,400
 before you say the one you want to say.

508
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
 Repeat after me.

509
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
 Javangan Pantung.

510
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,400
 Javangan Pantung.

511
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,400
 Once again.

512
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
 Javangan Pantung.

513
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:56,400
 Alva.

514
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,400
 Why don't you repeat your spell?

515
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
 Do you think you're smart?

516
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,400
 Why are you just standing there?

517
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,400
 Come on.

518
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
 Repeat the spell.

519
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:28,400
 You're insulting me, Alva.

520
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 Shut up!

521
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,400
 You're too much, Alva.

522
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
 For that, you'll be punished.

523
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:52,400
 I'm sorry.

524
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
 Attention, everyone.

525
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
 All students, gather in the classroom.

526
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
 Once again.

527
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
 Attention, everyone.

528
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,400
 All students, gather in the classroom.

529
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
 Alva's School

530
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:18,400
 What is the important thing that needs to be discussed...

531
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
 until I have to leave my class?

532
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,400
 What steps should we take against Alva?

533
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
 I think that should not be discussed anymore.

534
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,400
 Alva should be expelled.

535
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
 Alva's School

536
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:43,400
 Expelling a student from the school...

537
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
 is not an easy task.

538
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,400
 But, Professor.

539
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
 What Alva has done...

540
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
 is beyond the limits.

541
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
 If we don't expel her...

542
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
 we can protest against her...

543
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
 by her parents.

544
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
 That's right.

545
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,400
 Three days until the full moon.

546
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,400
 And if in the full moon...

547
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,400
 the darkness of darkness gets her stone...

548
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,400
 she will get an unlimited power...

549
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
 that will destroy this world.

550
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,400
 And all of that will happen to Alva.

551
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
 Professor.

552
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
 Just now, at the break time...

553
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,400
 some students gave me this petition.

554
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,400
 The petition states that...

555
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
 all the students in this school...

556
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
 agree to expel Alva from this school.

557
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
 It seems...

558
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,400
 we have no other choice, Professor.

559
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
 Alva has to be expelled from this school.

560
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,400
 Alva has to be expelled from this school.

561
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:08,400
 Megantara.

562
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
 Call Alva.

563
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
 Tell her to come here.

564
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:22,400
 Luckily, my voice is back.

565
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
 If not...

566
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
 Professor Aldebaran will be angry.

567
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
 Megantara.

568
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
 Why did you call me?

569
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:47,400
 Good morning, Professor.

570
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
 The words you will hear...

571
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
 will not be pleasant to the ears.

572
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,400
 But you have to listen to them.

573
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,400
 Why, Professor?

574
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,400
 You are expelled from this school.

575
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
 [The school is in chaos]

576
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:24,400
 Now, prepare your things.

577
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,400
 The school's guard will take you to the dana tomorrow.

578
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
 I'm done talking.

579
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
 You can go now.

580
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
 [The school is in chaos]

581
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:53,400
 Professor.

582
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
 Excuse me.

583
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
 [The school is in chaos]

584
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400

 [The school is in chaos]

586
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
 Rolf.

587
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,400
 Did Alva...

588
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
 really take the stone?

589
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,400
 No.

590
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
 The child is innocent.

591
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,400
 If it's not Alva...

592
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,400
 it means Professor Agni is lying.

593
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
 No.

594
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
 Agni is not lying.

595
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
 Something has happened.

596
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
 And we have to find out...

597
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
 what really happened.

598
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400

 Rih.

600
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:13,400
 Professor Aldebaran just called me.

601
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,400
 You don't know...

602
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,400
 what punishment I got from Professor Aldebaran.

603
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
 It's all my fault.

604
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
 I was so stupid to be lied to.

605
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
 Rih!

606
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
 [The school is in chaos]

607
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:38,400
 Rih!

608
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
 Come here.

609
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
 Help me.

610
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
 To find the mantra to open the seal.

611
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
 Hurry up.

612
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
 It's okay.

613
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
 Read this.

614
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
 It's okay.

615
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
 Just tell me.

616
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
 I'm here for a refreshing.

617
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
 Not to read a book.

618
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
 I don't want to know.

619
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
 You have to help me.

620
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
 Dufuduk!

621
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,400
 Wow!

622
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400

624
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:23,400
 Eda.

625
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
 Enough.

626
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,400
 I'm so sleepy.

627
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
 Let me go.

628
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
 You can sleep later.

629
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 But I'll find the mantra.

630
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,400
 I'm so tired.

631
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,400
 I got the mantra.

632
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
 Yes!

633
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
 Yay!

634
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
 I can sleep.

635
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
 Yes.

636
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
 I'll let you go.

637
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
 Amen.

 [The school is in chaos]

640
00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:19,400
 I just remembered.

641
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
 The ring.

642
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
 The ring of the snake.

643
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:33,400
 But it's useless.

644
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,400
 You're out.

645
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
 What's wrong?

 [The school is in chaos]

650
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:22,400
 It's done.

651
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:32,400
 Yes!

652
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
 I did it.

654
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:47,400
 Why are you going there?

655
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
 Because I'm scared.

656
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
 Yesterday, a kid got bewitched.

657
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
 And he fainted here.

658
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,400
 Don't say that.

659
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,400
 My head is spinning.

660
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
 I'm so scared.

661
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,400
 Don't ask anything to my brother.

662
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
 I don't want to talk to you.

663
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
 Understand?

664
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
 But you have to tell me.

665
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
 Who attacked Ava?

666
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,400
 At first, there was Professor Agni.

667
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
 Professor Agni?

668
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,400
 And then, this place was so smoky.

669
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,400
 I didn't see who attacked the kid.

670
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,400
 But he attacked with magic.

671
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,400
 He must have a great power.

672
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
 I'm going to move to another place.

673
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
 It's scary here.

674
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:45,400
 At least, now I know.

675
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
 Ava is not wrong.

676
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:55,400
 Where are we going?

677
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,400
 There!

678

679
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
 Do you see Alva?

680

 Come on, hurry up!

 Alva was kicked out?

695
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,400
 Let's ask the teacher.

696
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,400
 Yes.

697
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,400
 The news you heard is true.

698
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,400
 Alva is being taken to the lake by the school's police.

699
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,400
 I'm the one who's wrong.

700
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
 I was mean to Alva.

701
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,400
 She told me about the punishment.

702
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
 But I didn't want to hear it.

703
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,400
 You're too much.

704
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,400
 You're not sensitive at all.

705
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,400
 Everyone says that.

706
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,400
 Even if I'm handsome, I'm not sensitive.

707
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,400
 Why?

708
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,400
 But, Alva is innocent.

709
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,400
 We have to make her go back to school.

710
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
 But we don't have any evidence.

711
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
 You're talking nonsense.

712
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
 We can't make a solid evidence.

713
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,400
 But we have to investigate it together.

714
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,400
 And Alva is a soldier's friend.

715
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
 How can a soldier be so confident...

716
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
 ...to see his own friend who's innocent...

717
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,400
 ...but being punished so severely?

718
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,400
 Alva, you're in charge now.

719
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,400
 This boat will take you back.

720

 I'm going back.

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
 I'm going back.

724
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:29,400
 I'm going back.

725
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
 Goodbye, Vega.

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
 Goodbye, Rey.

727
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,400
 I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

728
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,400
 But if I do, they'll be mad at me.

729
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
 They hate me.

730
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:58,400

 Why are you still here?

734

 I know who stole the stone.

735
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
 Who?

736
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
 Professor Tuluak.

737
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
 I'll prove that I'm right.

738
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
 Just wait and see.

739
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
 Let's go!

740
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,400
 Don't let the stone...

741
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,400
 ...be given to the 8th Prince.

742
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,400
 There are two of them.

743
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
 Two?

744
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,400
 To be continued...

745
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,400
 Show your spirit, get ready...

746

 ...my friend.

747
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,400
 Run, jump, and conquer...

748
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
 ...the stars.

749
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:19,400
 Be brave, don't give up.

750
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:27,400
 Chase your dreams.

751
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,400

 Go, go, go, fight with all your might.

754
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,400
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud.

755

 Go, go, go, let's dream.

756
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,400
 Go, go, go, we'll make it.

 D'yiii!
