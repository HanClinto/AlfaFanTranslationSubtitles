00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Oh yeah, I just remembered that the magic mirror is very sharp

197
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
After that, he knows where we are

198
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Really?

199
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Help!

200
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Oh my god

201
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Are you ready, Rita?

202
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
I don't know

203
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Happy birthday

204
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Rita, what if he's a ghost?

205
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
What about my parents?

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't know

207
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
I'll look for another one

208
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Wait, let's hide first

209
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
How do we hide?

210
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Someone's down there

211
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Let's go

212
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:58,320
[Ghosts]

213
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm scared

214
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Calm down, honey

215
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Actually, a ghost can be a good pet

216
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
As long as you can touch its nose

217
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:20,320
[Ghosts]

218
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
My dad said

219
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,320
If you want to pet a ghost, you have to touch its nose

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
What?

221
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Don't be ridiculous

222
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes

223
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Hold it, Rita

224
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Are you crazy?

225
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Just hold it

226
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Don't be ridiculous

227
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,320
What are you doing?

228
00:12:48,320 --> 00:13:40,320
[Ghosts]

229
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
It's a real ghost

230
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Yes, we have a ghost

231
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
It's scary

232
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I want to try

233
00:13:48,320 --> 00:14:00,320
[Ghosts]

234
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
I'll look for another one

235
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
[Ghosts]

236
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
I'll go

237
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
[Ghosts]

238
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
I want to touch it

239
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
[Ghosts]

240
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:25,520
Now, I will try some music!

241
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:38,000
One, two, now stay still!

242
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Yeah! We're the champions!

243
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
One, two, three!

244
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
We're the champions!

245
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Yeah!

246
00:14:50,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Let's burn that monster!

247
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Hey, Panji, get out!

248
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Panji, get out!

249
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Get out!

250
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Panji, what's going on?

251
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Panji, get out!

252
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Get out!

253
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Panji, get out!

254
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Panji, you can't be a monster!

255
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
You can't get out!

256
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Panji, get out!

257
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Professor Adebar,

258
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
What do you want?

259
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I want you to come to my house.

260
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Why would I go there, Professor?

261
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Until now,

262
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Vega and his friends haven't returned.

263
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
And this is what worries me.

264
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
You know how I am.

265
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm afraid Vega and his friends will have a problem there.

266
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
But why should I, Professor?

267
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Why don't you just hold the reins?

268
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Or Professor Yasmin, or Professor Raki?

269
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
You know that I've never liked Panji.

270
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
He's a weirdo.

271
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
I know.

272
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
You're the only one who can go there, Professor.

273
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Because the other professors,

274
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Megantara, Yasmin, Agni, and Titan,

275
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,720
They have other tasks for the kids.

276
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
And one more thing,

277
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
You're the only one who can hurt Panji.

278
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
What do you think, Professor?

279
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Are you ready?

280
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Yes.

281
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Whatever you say, Professor.

282
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
I will do it.

283
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I'll count to three.

284
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
If you don't come out, I'll slam the door.

285
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Huh?

286
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Where is this?

287
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Everyone's waiting for me to come out.

288
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm scared.

289
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
One.

290
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Two.

291
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Three.

292
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Go back there.

293
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Run!

294
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Let's chase them.

295
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Don't run!

296
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Let's go.

297
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Be careful.

298
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Don't run!

299
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Where do you think you're going?

300
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Let's go.

301
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Where are you going?

302
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Just burn them.

303
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Let's go.

304
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Burn them.

305
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Don't burn them!

306
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
That's a good story.

307
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
This story is not bad.

308
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,720
There's no good story.

309
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Let's burn them.

310
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Is he really a good person?

311
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
He's a good person. / We don't know.

312
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Let's run away.

313
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I agree.

314
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Let's run away.

315
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
We should wait for this story.

316
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Let's go.

317
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
We should wait for this story.

318
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
What if something happens to us?

319
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,720
We won't be able to live.

320
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Let's go.

321
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
It's quite far.

322
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Let's just fight them.

323
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
How?

324
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Just run.

325
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Burn them.

326
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Let's run.

327
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Don't let them get away.

328
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
People.

329
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Don't be afraid to attack those kids.

330
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
They're evil.

331
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
No.

332
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
That's a lie.

333
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
It's true.

334
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,720
He's evil.

335
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
You all are his followers.

336
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
You're a slanderer.

337
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
That's right.

338
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,720
People.

339
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Don't believe him.

340
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Kids.

341
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Who believes you?

342
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,720
People.

343
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Let's attack them.

344
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Let's solve this problem.

345
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Catch and burn those kids.

346
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Don't.

347
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Be a man.

348
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
5 minutes later.

349
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,720
We got caught.

350
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Five minutes.

351
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Five years.

352
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Don't be stupid.

353
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
This can be a true story.

354
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
We should pity them.

355
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Enough.

356
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Let's talk later.

357
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Let's go.

358
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Run.

359
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Where are we going?

360
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Let's hide in the well.

361
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Let's go.

362
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:54,720
It's so hard to find them.

363
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Luckily, this is a good place.

364
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,720
If not, I won't be able to sleep.

365
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Don't be noisy.

366
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
They'll come here.

367
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Before they come here.

368
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Let's just hide.

369
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,720
How many branches are there?

370
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Five minutes later.

371
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:35,720
What's wrong?

372
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm not afraid.

373
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
I won't let them destroy me.

374
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Where are the kids?

375
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Everyone.

376
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
I told you.

377
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
They're the kids.

378
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
They're evil.

379
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
They made us stupid.

380
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
We shouldn't waste our time.

381
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Let's chase them.

382
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Let's go.

383
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I'm sure they're still here.

384
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Let's look for them somewhere else.

385
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Maybe they're not here.

386
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Let's look for them.

387
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Luckily, we're not caught.

388
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
If they're far away, let's go here.

389
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Here.

390
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Shh.

391
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,720
They can be gone.

392
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Is that a sound?

393
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Yes.

394
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I think the sound is coming from here.

395
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Where?

396
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
I think it's coming from there.

397
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Let's go.

398
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
One, two, three.

399
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,720
You're going to pay for this.

400
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Wait.

401
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Let me check.

402
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
What's that?

403
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
"Police"

404
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Let's go, Becky.

405
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:39,720
You can't go anywhere.

406
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Don't leave me, Becky.

407
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Let's go.

408
00:25:51,720 --> 00:26:08,720
You can't escape this time.

409
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
"Police"

410
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:21,720
People.

411
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Listen to me.

412
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I'm Angkara.

413
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
A good slayer.

414
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,720
And now...

415
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
I'm going to burn this evil tribe...

416
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
with eternal fire.

417
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
And as you know,

418
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,720
this eternal fire...

419
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
can't be extinguished by the magic of people.

420
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Let me go.

421
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Let go of that witch.

422
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Don't burn it again.

423
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Let go of that witch.

424
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
And now,

425
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
it's time for me to burn her.

426
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
No.

427
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Let go of that witch.

428
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
"Police"

429
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Let's go.

430
00:27:46,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Let go of that witch.

431
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Feel this.

432
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
My friends,

433
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
now you can go.

434
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Let me see the magic of this witch.

435
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Thank you, good slayer.

436
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Let's go home.

437
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Let's go.

438
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
"Police"

439
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Let go of that witch.

440
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:07,720
"Police"

441
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
And now, the second task.

442
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Which is to bring you, Alva.

443
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,720
I will give you to the eighth witch.

444
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,720
So that you will be consumed by her.

445
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Let us go.

446
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:19,720
"Police"

447
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Attack the green man.

448
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Okay.

449
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Three.

450
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Attack him.

451
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
"Police"

452
00:30:46,720 --> 00:31:10,720
The witch is holding on.

453
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Where is she?

454
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
I'll go there.

455
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Pavanam.

456
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Let me try.

457
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Don't cut the water.

458
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
"Police"

459
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Let me try.

460
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,720
"Police"

461
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Hey, you.

462
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
You're being funny.

463
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Stop fighting.

464
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Fire!

465
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:24,720
We will win.

466
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Just like what the professor said.

467
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
We will win.

468
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Baby, baby.

469
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
We will burn it.

470
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Help!

471
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,720
The fire is so strong.

472
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
This is eternal fire.

473
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
It will not be extinguished.

474
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
What should we do?

475
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Baby, hold on.

476
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Now, go back to your place.

477
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Make sure you're safe.

478
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
And bring the body here.

479
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:17,720
"We can do it"

480
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Yes.

481
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,720
He can use the flashlight.

482
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
He can go from there.

483
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
No way.

484
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
He can't talk.

485
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,720
You're right.

486
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,720
He has to move.

487
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,720
So, we have to change him to be Mr. Panji.

488
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
But, how?

489
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Yes.

490
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
He can't talk.

491
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,720
If he's exposed to the sun, we have to make him talk.

492
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Make him talk?

493
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
No way.

494
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,720
How can we make him talk?

495
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Well...

496
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
We have to try.

497
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Let's try to find a book.

498
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
How can we do it?

499
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
It's too long.

500
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,720
I can't read.

501
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
I know.

502
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I love you, Blacky.

503
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Oh, right.

504
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
I know how.

505
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Wait a minute.

506
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Putri Bintang!

507
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Help me!

508
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I'm lost! Putri Bintang!

509
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Putri Bintang!

510
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Alva?

511
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Alva, Plita, everyone.

512
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
How are you?

513
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Alva!

514
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:21,720
There's fire.

515
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Are you having fun?

516
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
It's so fun.

517
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
It's not a fire.

518
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
It's a serigala.

519
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Serigala is me, a human.

520
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Oh, my God.

521
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
He's about to be burned.

522
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I want to ask you for a favor.

523
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Can you make the sun appear?

524
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
If there's a sun, it will turn into a human.

525
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:51,720
I want to go up. Can you do it?

526
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,720
But don't take too long.

527
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I'm sorry, Blacky.

528
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm so sorry, guys.

529
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,720
I can't help you.

530
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Because I don't know the sun.

531
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
It appears in the morning.

532
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
If I'm here at night...

533
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh, no.

534
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
We can't.

535
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Can you make it?

536
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,720
How?

537
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Oh, I know.

538
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
I can call my friends, the moon and the stars,

539
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
to hide.

540
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
So, the sun can come earlier.

541
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Okay, let's do it.

542
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Let's do it.

543
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Okay.

544
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Friends, the moon and the stars,

545
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
let's hide.

546
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
So, the sun can come earlier.

547
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Okay.

548
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:21,720
It's morning.

549
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Mr. Baji, you have to go there.

550
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,720
You have to use the mantap to move.

551
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Move.

552
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,720
How's the result, Angkar?

553
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm afraid of being caught by the wrong friends.

554
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
And they make me feel guilty.

555
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I'm so nervous.

556
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Angkar!

557
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Why are you quiet?

558
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Angkar!

559
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Answer me!

560
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Sir.

561
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
This time,

562
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
the Mahadasyat is successful.

563
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
I've managed to provoke all the villagers...

564
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
to burn all of those.

565
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
And now, all of those...

566
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,720
have become grilled meat, sir.

567
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
(The fire is burning)

568
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Did you see it yourself when it died?

569
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,720
No, sir.

570
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
But...

571
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
it can't be successful.

572
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Because I've burned it with eternal fire.

573
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
And eternal fire can't be extinguished, sir.

574
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Idiot!

575
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Now, go back to your place.

576
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Make sure you stay there.

577
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,720
And bring the body here.

578
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Yes, sir.

579
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Okay, sir.

580
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Wait, sir.

581
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
(The fire is burning)

582
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Sir.

583
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Mom.

584
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Dad.

585
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Mom.

586
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,720
Sir.

587
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Why are they here?

588
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
How is it?

589
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,720
The story...

590
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
is very sad.

591
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
(The story is sad)

592
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
In the past,

593
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I was the son of the 8th Prince.

594
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,720
The 8th Prince...

595
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
taught me...

596
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
to be a cruel and cruel ruler...

597
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,720
who hurt anyone...

598
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
without looking back.

599
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,720
(The 8th Prince)

600
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Spa.

601
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Kill him.

602
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
(The 8th Prince)

603
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:26,720
Good.

604
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
(The 8th Prince)

605
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,720
But in the meantime,

606
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,720
I have two friends.

607
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Those two friends are your parents.

608
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Gama and Aquila.

609
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Actually,

610
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,720
they often advised me to leave the 8th Prince.

611
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,720
But I didn't want to.

612
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Because I wanted to be strong.

613
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,720
One day,

614
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,720
I was given a task by the 8th Prince.

615
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,720
But I failed.

616
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
When he knew my failure,

617
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
he was furious.

618
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
He wanted to kill me.

619
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:37,720
But suddenly,

620
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
someone threw a smoke bomb...

621
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
and killed me.

622
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,720
That person is Gama.

623
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
(The 8th Prince)

624
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
In the end, I decided...

625
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,720
to leave the 8th Prince.

626
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,720
But the 8th Prince didn't listen.

627
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
He was very cruel.

628
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,720
He was very angry with Gama.

629
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
And he insisted...

630
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
that he must destroy Gama and Aquila.

631
00:43:20,720 --> 00:44:25,720
(The 8th Prince)

632
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:34,720
So, the way I talk in my book...

633
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
is just a dream?

634
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:53,720
We can do it.

635
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
Why?

636
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Only my parents were killed.

637
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
Why didn't I?

638
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,720
You mean...

639
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,720
he didn't kill you and let you live?

640
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:24,720
No one knows about that.

641
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,720
But one thing is clear.

642
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,720
When the 8th Prince attacked you...

643
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,720
a power appeared in you...

644
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,720
and made the 8th Prince go berserk.

645
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,720
When he tried to attack you again...

646
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
he realized...

647
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,720
that he had lost all his power.

648
00:45:49,720 --> 00:46:15,720
(The 8th Prince)

649
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,720
My magic power is gone.

650
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,720
This is impossible.

651
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,720
It's impossible.

652
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,720
My magic power is gone.

653
00:46:49,720 --> 00:47:02,720
Then, why did the 8th Prince go berserk...

654
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
when he attacked me?

655
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,720
According to Aldebaran...

656
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,720
that was a love spell.

657
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,720
Your parents created that spell.

658
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:27,720
You know Aldebaran?

659
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Yes.

660
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,720
He was the teacher of the 5 guardians of the magic.

661
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,720
When I was still in school...

662
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
he was a magician.

663
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,720
Now he's a schoolmaster.

664
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,720
Oh.

665
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,720
So, he was a magician?

666
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:59,720
He was half my age.

667
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,720
So, that means...

668
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
you're really old.

669
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
(The 8th Prince)

670
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,720
You're so naughty.

671
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,720
Do you want to hear the rest?

672
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,720
Of course.

673
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Don't worry.

674
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,720
The 8th Prince who has lost all his power...

675
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,720
is trying to find a way...

676
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,720
to get back all his power.

677
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,720
He's looking for all kinds of sources.

678
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,720
And finally he realizes...

679
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
that there's a way...

680
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,720
to get back all his power.

681
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,720
That is with blood...

682
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
tears...

683
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,720
and Alva's sweat.

684
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,720
Then, why are my parents here?

685
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:15,720
Gamma, I'm lost.

686
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,720
I'm lost.

687
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Gamma.

688
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,720
Gamma, I'm lost.

689
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,720
I'm the chain of life.

690
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Put me in the chamber.

691
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
(The 8th Prince)

692
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
I thought...

693
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,720
this chain of life could heal them.

694
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,720
But because their wounds are too bad...

695
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,720
they can't be healed, Alva.

696
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,720
They can only sleep...

697
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,720
and can't wake up again.

698
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,720
This chain of life...

699
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,720
only supports their lives.

700
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,720
As far as I know, they can only get married.

701
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,720
So, my parents...

702
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,720
only came through a dream?

703
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:50,720
You said they appeared in your dream?

704
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
Yes.

705
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
No wonder.

706
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,720
They told me to pray...

707
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,720
and cheer me up.

708
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
Alva.

709
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,720
If Gamma and I appear in your dream...

710
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,720
please ask them...

711
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,720
what I should do...

712
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,720
to wake them up.

713
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,720
Okay.

714
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,720
I'll be there.

715
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,720
Okay.

716
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
I'll be going now.

717
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,720
I have unfinished business.

718
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,720
Sir.

719
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Where are you going?

720
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
I want to meet Ankara.

721
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
I'm curious about him.

722
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Why is he attacking me?

723
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
We used to be friends.

724
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
Don't meet him.

725
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,720
He's the 8th Prince's son.

726
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,720
Ankara is the 8th Prince's son?

727
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
Yes.

728
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,720
They're getting stronger.

729
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
Because they got...

730
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,720
my tears, sweat, and blood.

731
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:21,720
All of them must have been burned to ashes.

732
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
But...

733
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,720
I have to go back to Ankara.

734
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,720
(Gamma's dream)

735
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:54,720
I'm going to war.

736
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,720
The 8th Prince won't be able to differentiate.

737
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Look.

738
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,720
This is his body.

739
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,720
He's already become a hero.

740
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,720
I'm dead.

741
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,720
Maybe it's not my destiny.

742
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
I'm going there.

743
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
I won't let him get away with it.

744
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:44,720
I finally defeated him.

745
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,720
What's wrong with you?

746
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,720
Who ordered you to kill him?

747
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,720
I'm sorry, sir.

748
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,720
Guys, someone's coming.

749
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
Don't tell me...

750
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,720
it's Professor Ankara.

751
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,720
As soon as the door is opened,

752
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,720
we'll attack Professor Ankara with the TV.

753
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,720
Okay?

754
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
Okay.

755
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
Let's go.

756
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,720
Let's go in.

757
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,720
Don't lock the door.

758
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,720
TV!

759
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,720
Professor Burua!

760
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,720
Professor Burua?

761
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,720
What's going on?

762
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
I'm sorry, Professor.

763
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,720
Shut up, Professor!

764
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,720
Shut up, all of you!

765
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,720
Let's go back to the room.

766
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
No one can go back.

767
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,720
Shut up!

768
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,720
Professor Burua,

769
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,720
why are you here?

770
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,720
Shut up!

771
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:36,720
What's going on?

772
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Panji.

773
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,720
This must be your doing.

774
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,720
You must have ordered the kids to attack me.

775
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,720
Right?

776
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Don't you dare accuse me.

777
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:56,720
Professor Burua,

778
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,720
I'm sorry.

779
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
We didn't mean to.

780
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
We thought...

781
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,720
the professor was Professor Ankara.

782
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,720
Yes, sir.

783
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,720
We thought he was Professor Ankara.

784
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
So, we avoided it.

785
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Yes, sir.

786
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
We avoided it.

787
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,720
(Professor Burua, what are you doing here?)

788
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,720
I was ordered by Professor Aldebaran...

789
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,720
to come here...

790
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,720
and pick all of you up...

791
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
to go back to school.

792
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,720
What?

793
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,720
So, Professor Burua came here to pick us up?

794
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
Yes.

795
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,720
(Professor Burua, what are you doing here?)

796
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,720
(I'm still here to protect you.)

797
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,720
(Or am I going to Professor Burua?)

798
00:56:44,720 --> 00:57:05,720
We will eliminate Aldebaran.

799
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,720
And I will promote you as the head of the magic school.

800
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:26,720
I order you...

801
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,720
to pack your things...

802
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,720
and come with me to the magic school.

803
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
I'm sorry, Professor.

804
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
I don't want to.

805
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
I don't want to go home.

806
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Alva, I remind you.

807
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,720
You are still a student.

808
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,720
I am your teacher.

809
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
And I am responsible for your safety.

810
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,720
So, you have to come with me.

811
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,720
Tole, Vega, Pelita, Ray.

812
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
Let's go.

813
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
We don't want to.

814
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,720
I don't want to go home either.

815
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
I want to stay here.

816
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,720
We don't want to.

817
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720
I don't want to either.

818
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,720
Yes, Professor.

819
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,720
We are being forced to eat.

820
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,720
We only have three meals.

821
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,720
We are not full, Professor.

822
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,720
Professor, we have an important mission here.

823
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,720
To all good people.

824
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,720
Panji.

825
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,720
I know.

826
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,720
This must be your doing.

827
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
You told the kids to stay here.

828
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,720
You brainwashed them, right?

829
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
No, no, no, Sir.

830
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,720
I am the one who is wrong.

831
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,720
I told you.

832
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Don't just accuse me.

833
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,720
Now, it's clear.

834
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,720
They all prefer to be with me...

835
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,720
than with you.

836
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,720
We still have unfinished business.

837
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,720
You'll see.

838
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
Alva, let's go home.

839
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,720
No. / Come on.

840
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,720
No, Sir.

841
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,720
I don't want to go home.

842
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,720
Shut up. You have to come with me.

843
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
No, Sir. I don't want to go home.

844
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
Enough, you two.

845
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,720
Let Alva go.

846
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
Let them go. Go home by yourselves.

847
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,720
I'm warning you.

848
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,720
Don't get involved in my business.

849
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Alva, let's go home.

850
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
The other kids, let's go home.

851
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,720
Professor, don't go there.

852
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,720
Yes, Sir. Don't go there.

853
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,720
I don't want to go home with you.

854
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,720
I want to stay here with Mr. Banci.

855
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,720
I'm sorry, Sir.

856
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,720
I still have unfinished business here.

857
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:42,720
Alright.

858
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,720
If you want it this way,

859
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,720
Alva,

860
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,720
I'll let you stay here.

861
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,720
But on one condition.

862
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,720
What is it, Sir?

863
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,720
You have to compete against me.

864
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:16,720
If you lose,

865
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,720
you and the others have to take me back to the magic school.

866
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
But if you win,

867
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:30,720
I'll let you stay here with Mr. Banci.

868
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:41,720
What do you say?

869
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
I'm in.

870
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,720
If you don't want to compete against me,

871
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,720
I'll consider you surrender.

872
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,720
And that means you failed.

873
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,720
And because of that,

874
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,720
you and the others have to go to the magic school.

875
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,720
Come on, kids. Let's go home.

876
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,720
I want to compete.

877
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:11,720
Alva wants to compete?

878
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,720
Oh, God.

879
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,720
You're just looking for trouble.

880
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
Mr. Banci is dead, Sir.

881
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,720
So, what's our next plan?

882
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,720
I'll move on to the second round.

883
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,720
But before that,

884
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,720
I'll give you a present, Angkara.

885
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Because you've done a great job on your mission.

886
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,720
What do you want, Angkara?

887
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
I'll give you a present.

888
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,720
I want you to be a good boy.

889
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
What do you want, Angkara?

890
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,720
I'll grant your wish.

891
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,720
I want to be the head of the magic school, Sir.

892
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,720
What a coincidence, Angkara.

893
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,720
That's what I've been thinking about.

894
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,720
Then,

895
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,720
we'll send Aldebaran to the fire prison.

896
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,720
And I'll make you the head of the magic school, Angkara.

897
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,720
Thank you, Sir.

898
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,720
Finally,

899
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,720
my chance to destroy Aldebaran as the head of the magic school has come.

900
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,720
As the head of the magic school of Mendiamkage Sayang,

901
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,720
I want to make the final vote

902
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,720
to decide who deserves to be the head of the magic school.

903
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
(VOTE)

904
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,720
Please.

905
01:02:48,720 --> 01:03:41,720
(VOTE)

906
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,720
The current position

907
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,720
for Professor Aldebaran and Professor Angkara

908
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,720
is the same.

909
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,720
There is only one vote left.

910
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,720
Please, Professor Agni.

911
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:05,720
I will win, because Agni will choose me.

912
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:28,720
(VOTE)

913
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,720
Professor Agni chooses Professor Aldebaran.

914
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:56,720
(VOTE)

915
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,720
Long live, Professor Aldebaran!

916
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,720
Why did you choose Aldebaran?

917
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,720
Because you are my future wife's candidate.

918
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
Angkara,

919
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,720
we do have a close relationship.

920
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,720
And the school's head's choice

921
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,720
has nothing to do with our relationship.

922
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,720
I'm sure,

923
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,720
that Aldebaran can be a good school's head.

924
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,720
So, you mean

925
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
I'm not good?

926
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
No.

927
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,720
That's not what I mean.

928
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,720
I'm disappointed in you.

929
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:44,720
Take this!

930
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Sir!

931
01:05:48,720 --> 01:06:03,720
We can do it!

932
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,720
Now, attention!

933
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Step back.

934
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,720
The third round.

935
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,720
The match starts now.

936
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,720
Round one.

937
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:28,720
One.

938
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,720
Two.

939
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,720
Three.

940
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:40,720
Finish him!

941
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
Sir!

942
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:56,720
It's just a small match.

943
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,720
It seems,

944
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,720
no one supports me.

945
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,720
Can I have a round of applause for my first round?

946
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,720
We are a strong team.

947
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
We don't want to be a burden.

948
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Yes.

949
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,720
We are a strong team.

950
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,720
I don't want to be a traitor.

951
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:23,720
What's that?

952
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,720
Yes.

953
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
Let's just give it a try.

954
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,720
We are at risk.

955
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,720
Yes.

956
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,720
Good morning, kids.

957
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,720
Good morning, sir.

958
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,720
You might be wondering about the writing in front of you.

959
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,720
Here's the thing.

960
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,720
Our school will have a selection.

961
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:55,720
Who among you has the ability and is ready to fight?

962
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:02,720
The chosen one will be part of the Al-Nibbar squad.

963
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,720
The mission of the Al-Nibbar squad is...

964
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,720
First, you must be ready to attack the magic school.

965
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:20,720
Second, you must be ready to destroy the Dark Lord.

966
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,720
The Dark Lord?

967
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,720
Yes.

968
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,720
That's right.

969
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,720
So, from now on,

970
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,720
we can't just randomly choose a kid to be a part of the squad.

971
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,720
We must select him correctly.

972
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
That's right, kids.

973
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,720
What Professor Agni said is true.

974
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,720
That's right.

975
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,720
This is my chance to be a champion.

976
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,720
While Alpha is gone.

977
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,720
I'm in!

978
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
Me too!

979
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,720
Mommy, are you sure you want to join?

980
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,720
You said you wanted to join the Al-Nibbar squad.

981
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,720
Are you sure you want to join?

982
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,720
You ran away when we fought the raptor.

983
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,720
Just you wait.

984
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,720
I'll fight the Dark Lord with all I've got.

985
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:20,720
We've arrived at the magic school, sir.

986
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Okay, kids.

987
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,720
Before we start,

988
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,720
let's sing the song,

989
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,720
"Mars, the Magic School".

990
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,720
Oh, my children.

991
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,720
Don't forget the style I taught you.

992
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,720
Yes, sir.

993
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,720
Kids,

994
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,720
since this is the song, "Mars",

995
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,720
you must be excited to sing it.

996
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,720
Yes, sir.

997
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,720
Good.

998
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,720
Let's start on three.

999
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,720
One, two, three.

1000
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,720
Show your spirit,

1001
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,720
get your friends ready.

1002
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:06,720
Run, jump, and get on the stars.

1003
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,720
Be brave,

1004
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,720
don't give up.

1005
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,720
Chase your dreams.

1006
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,720
You,

1007
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,720
if you become the head of the school here,

1008
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,720
you change the song.

1009
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,720
They all must be my followers.

1010
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,720
Yes, sir.

1011
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,720
I'll make this school the second headquarter.

1012
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:40,720
Just watch me.

1013
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:46,720
You'll know that I'm better at making a school than a war.

1014
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,720
[Mars, the Magic School]

1015
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,720
My children,

1016
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
try to imitate me.

1017
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,720
Ahai.

1018
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,720
Give me a smile.

1019
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,720
How is this,

1020
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,720
the students of the same grade?

1021
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,720
How can you beat the 8th grade?

1022
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,720
You've already lost against the 7th grade.

1023
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,720
Whose voice is that?

1024
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,720
That's the voice.

1025
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,720
That's not the voice.

1026
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,720
[The Magic School]

1027
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,720
Your task now is to find the right person.

1028
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Okay, sir.

1029
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:28,720
Show your spirit,

1030
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,720
get your friends ready.

1031
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:38,720
Run, jump, and get on the stars.

1032
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,720
Be brave,

1033
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,720
don't give up.

1034
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:53,720
Chase your dreams.

1035
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,720
Go, go, go,

1036
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,720
reach all your dreams.

1037
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Go, go, go,

1038
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
never stop.

1039
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,720
Go, go, go,

1040
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,720
fight with your heart.

1041
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,720
Go, go, go,

1042
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,720
make yourself proud.

1043
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,720
Go, go, go,

1044
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,720
let's dream.

1045
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,720
Go, go, go,

1046
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,720
we will.
