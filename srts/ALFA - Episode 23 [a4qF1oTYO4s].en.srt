00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I don't want all my plans to be ruined

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We'll wait until the full moon

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Because now is the right time for us to fight

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Think!

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 What have you done?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Who are you?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Who are you really?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 You're the one who stole my parents' house

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Don't ask me!

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I'm not lying!

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm the one who stole it!

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 No, I'm not!

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And they're my parents!

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We don't have much time

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We only have 6 hours

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And I don't want to see Serigala turn into a pancake

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Do you understand?

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Yes, sir

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I'm ready

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Action!

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Serigala, I'm coming!

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Where are you?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'm here, I'm here!

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I'm coming!

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I'm coming!

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Serigala!

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Boss, let's go!

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I'm here!

 I'm here!

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I'm here!

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 What the power!

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Cut the rope!

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Sir, don't pull me!

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'm going to break the rock!

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 You can't do it alone, right?

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I'm coming!

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Sir!

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Help me!

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 There's a thief!

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 What's wrong?

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I was attacked, sir!

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 What was attacked?

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I was attacked by Serigala's monster, sir!

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Serigala?

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Serigala came out of my parents' house

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 If so, let's take him to the village doctor!

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Let's go!

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 If that's the situation,

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 In my opinion,

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 The only way is

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Starting tomorrow,

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I will train the children

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 So they are more prepared to fight

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 But can they do it, Megantara?

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 They are brave children

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 At home, I won't leave them alone

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 If necessary,

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I'm ready to sacrifice my life

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Until the last drop of blood for them

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But there's one more problem, Megantara

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 What's the problem, professor?

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 About Alva

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Until now

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I haven't heard from Vega

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I'm afraid

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 They have a problem with me

 Me, Professor Titan

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 He's the right person

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 To find Vega and his friends to my place

 We're left with just a little bit of blood

 We're done!

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Give us more, Vega!

 If he wants to,

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 He can have our blood!

108

 Where are we going?

109

 You're the only one who can help us

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Go!

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Go, Srigala!

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I know the way!

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 What's the lock?

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 It's a secret

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 We should gather men

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And burn him

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000

 I think it's over

216
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
 Let's go to the toilet

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160

228
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:24,320

 What do you want?

308
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
 I want you to come to my house.

309
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,720
 Why would I go there, Professor?

310
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,720
 Until now,

311
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 Vega and his friends haven't returned.

312
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
 And this is what worries me.

313
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
 You know how I am.

314
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,720
 I'm afraid Vega and his friends will have a problem there.

315
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 But why should I, Professor?

316
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
 Why don't you just hold the reins?

317
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 Or Professor Yasmin, or Professor Raki?

318
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
 You know that I've never liked Panji.

319
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
 He's a weirdo.

320
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
 I know.

321
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
 You're the only one who can go there, Professor.

322
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
 Because the other professors,

323
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 Megantara, Yasmin, Agni, and Titan,

324
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,720
 They have other tasks for the kids.

325
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
 And one more thing,

326
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
 You're the only one who can hurt Panji.

327
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
 What do you think, Professor?

328
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
 Are you ready?

329
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
 Yes.

330
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 Whatever you say, Professor.

331
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
 I will do it.

332
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:16,720
 I'll count to three.

333
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 If you don't come out, I'll slam the door.

334
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720

335
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
 I'm scared.

339
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 I'm scared.

340
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720

344
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 Go back there.

345
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 Go back there.

346
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 Go back there.

347
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
 Go back there.

348
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
 Run!

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
 Let's chase them.

350
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,720
 Don't run!

351
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 Let's go.

352
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 Be careful.

353
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 Don't run!

354
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 Where do you think you're going?

355
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 Let's go.

356
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 Where are you going?

357
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
 Just burn them.

358
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
 Let's go.

359
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
 Burn them.

360
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,720
 Don't burn them!

361
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 That's a good story.

362
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
 This story is not bad.

363
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,720
 There's no good story.

364
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
 Let's burn them.

365
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 Is he really a good person?

366
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 He's a good person. / We don't know.

367
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 Let's run away.

368
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
 I agree.

369
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
 Let's run away.

370
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
 We should wait for this story.

371
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
 Let's go.

372
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
 We should wait for this story.

373
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
 What if something happens to us?

374
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,720
 We won't be able to live.

375
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 Let's go.

376
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 It's quite far.

377
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 Let's just fight them.

378
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
 How?

379
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
 Just run.

380
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,720
 Burn them.

381
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 Burn them.

382
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 Let's run.

383
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:57,720
 Don't let them get away.

384
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
 People.

385
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
 Don't be afraid to attack those kids.

386
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 They're evil.

387
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
 They're evil.

388
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
 No.

389
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 That's a lie.

390
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
 It's true.

391
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
 He's evil.

392
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,720
 He's evil.

393
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
 You all are his followers.

394
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
 You're a slanderer.

395
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 That's right.

396
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,720
 People.

397
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
 Don't believe him.

398
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,720
 Kids.

399
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
 Who believes you?

400
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,720
 People.

401
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
 Let's attack them.

402
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 Let's solve this problem.

403
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
 Catch and burn those kids.

404
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,720
 Don't.

405
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 Be a man.

406
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
 5 minutes later.

407
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,720
 We got caught.

408
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 Five minutes.

409
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
 Five years.

410
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
 Don't be stupid.

411
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
 This can be a true story.

412
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
 We should pity them.

413
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 Enough.

414
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
 Let's talk later.

415
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
 Let's go.

416
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 Let's go.

417
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
 Run.

418
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
 Where are we going?

419
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,720
 Let's hide in the well.

420
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
 Let's go.

421
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
 Let's go.

422
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 It's so hard to find them.

423
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 Luckily, this is a good place.

424
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 If not, I won't be able to sleep.

425
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 Don't be noisy.

426
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 They'll come here.

427
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
 Before they come here.

428
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 Let's just hide.

429
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 How many branches are there?

430
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
 Five minutes later.

431
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:35,720
 What's wrong?

432
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 I'm not afraid.

433
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
 I'm not afraid.

434
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 I won't let them destroy me.

435
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
 Where are the kids?

436
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
 Everyone.

437
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
 I told you.

438
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
 They're the kids.

439
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
 They're evil.

440
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
 They made us stupid.

441
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
 We shouldn't waste our time.

442
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
 Let's chase them.

443
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
 Let's go.

444
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:20,720
 I'm sure they're still here.

445
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 Let's look for them somewhere else.

446
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
 Maybe they're not here.

447
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
 Let's look for them.

448
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 Luckily, we're not caught.

449
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
 If they're far away, let's go here.

450
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 Here.

451
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 Shh.

452
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,720
 Shh.

453
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 They can be gone.

454
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,720
 Is that a sound?

455
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
 Yes.

456
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
 I think the sound is coming from here.

457
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
 Where?

458
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
 I think it's coming from there.

459
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 Let's go.

460
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
 One, two, three.

461
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,720
 You're going to pay for this.

462
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:38,720
 Wait.

463
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
 Let me check.

464
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 What's that?

465
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
 "Police"

466
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
 Let's go, Becky.

467
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:39,720
 You can't go anywhere.

468
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
 Don't leave me, Becky.

469
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
 Let's go.

470
00:25:51,720 --> 00:26:08,720
 You can't escape this time.

471
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
 "Police"

472
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:21,720
 People.

473
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 Listen to me.

474
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
 I'm Angkara.

475
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
 A good slayer.

476
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,720
 And now...

477
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
 I'm going to burn this evil tribe...

478
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
 with eternal fire.

479
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
 And as you know,

480
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,720
 this eternal fire...

481
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
 can't be extinguished by the magic of people.

482
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:55,720
 Let me go.

483
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,720
 Let go of that witch.

484
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
 Let go of that witch.

485
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,720
 Let go of that witch.

486
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,720
 Don't burn it again.

487
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
 Let go of that witch.

488
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 And now,

489
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
 it's time for me to burn her.

490
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
 No.

491
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,720
 Let go of that witch.

492
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
 Let go of that witch.

493
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 "Police"

494
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,720
 Let's go.

495
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,720
 Let's go.

496
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 Let's go.

497
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 Let go of that witch.

498
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:58,720
 Let go of that witch.

499
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
 Let go of that witch.

500
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
 Let go of that witch.

501
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
 Let go of that witch.

502
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:23,720
 Feel this.

503
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
 My friends,

504
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
 now you can go.

505
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,720
 Let me see the magic of this witch.

506
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 Thank you, good slayer.

507
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
 Let's go home.

508
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
 Let's go.

509
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
 "Police"

510
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,720
 Let go of that witch.

511
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 Let go of that witch.

512
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
 "Police"

513
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 "Police"

514
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
 "Police"

515
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
 "Police"

516
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
 And now, the second task.

517
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
 Which is to bring you, Alva.

518
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,720
 I will give you to the eighth witch.

519
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,720
 So that you will be consumed by her.

520
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 Let us go.

521
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
 "Police"

522
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
 "Police"

523
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 Attack the green man.

524
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,720
 Okay.

525
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,720
 Three.

526
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,720
 Attack him.

527
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
 "Police"

528
00:30:46,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 The witch is holding on.

529
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
 Where is she?

530
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
 Where is she?

531
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
 I'll go there.

532
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
 Pavanam.

533
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:31,720
 Let me try.

534
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
 Don't cut the water.

535
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
 "Police"

536
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:50,720
 Let me try.

537
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
 Let me try.

538
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,720
 "Police"

539
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,720
 Hey, you.

540
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
 You're being funny.

541
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
 Stop fighting.

542
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:12,720
 Fire!

543
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:24,720
 We will win.

544
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
 Just like what the professor said.

545
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
 We will win.

546
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 Baby, baby.

547
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
 We will burn it.

548
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
 Help!

549
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,720
 The fire is so strong.

550
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
 This is eternal fire.

551
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
 It will not be extinguished.

552
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 What should we do?

553
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
 Baby, hold on.

554
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 Now, go back to your place.

555
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
 Make sure you're safe.

556
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
 And bring the body here.

557
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,720
 "We can do it"

558
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:17,720
 "We can do it"

559
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
 Yes.

560
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,720
 He can use the flashlight.

561
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
 He can go from there.

562
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
 No way.

563
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
 He can't talk.

564
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,720
 You're right.

565
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,720
 He has to move.

566
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,720
 So, we have to change him to be Mr. Panji.

567
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
 But, how?

568
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
 Yes.

569
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
 He can't talk.

570
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,720
 If he's exposed to the sun, we have to make him talk.

571
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
 Make him talk?

572
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
 No way.

573
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,720
 How can we make him talk?

574
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
 Well...

575
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
 We have to try.

576
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
 Let's try to find a book.

577
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
 How can we do it?

578
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
 It's too long.

579
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
 I can't read.

580
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
 I can't read.

581
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
 I know.

582
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
 I love you, Blacky.

583
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,720
 Oh, right.

584
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
 I know how.

585
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
 Wait a minute.

586
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,720
 Putri Bintang!

587
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,720
 Help me!

588
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,720
 I'm lost! Putri Bintang!

589
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,720
 Putri Bintang!

590
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,720
 Putri Bintang!

591
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:55,720
 Putri Bintang!

592
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,720
 Alva?

593
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:09,720
 Alva, Plita, everyone.

594
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
 How are you?

595
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
 Alva!

596
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:21,720
 There's fire.

597
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
 Are you having fun?

598
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
 It's so fun.

599
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
 It's not a fire.

600
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 It's a serigala.

601
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,720
 Serigala is me, a human.

602
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
 Oh, my God.

603
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
 He's about to be burned.

604
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
 I want to ask you for a favor.

605
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
 Can you make the sun appear?

606
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
 If there's a sun, it will turn into a human.

607
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:51,720
 I want to go up. Can you do it?

608
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,720
 But don't take too long.

609
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
 I'm sorry, Blacky.

610
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,720
 I'm so sorry, guys.

611
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,720
 I can't help you.

612
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,720
 Because I don't know the sun.

613
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
 It appears in the morning.

614
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
 If I'm here at night...

615
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
 Oh, no.

616
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
 We can't.

617
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
 Can you make it?

618
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,720
 How?

619
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
 How?

620
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,720
 Oh, I know.

621
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
 I can call my friends, the moon and the stars,

622
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
 to hide.

623
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
 So, the sun can come earlier.

624
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
 Okay, let's do it.

625
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
 Let's do it.

626
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
 Okay.

627
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,720
 Friends, the moon and the stars,

628
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
 let's hide.

629
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
 So, the sun can come earlier.

630
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
 Okay.

631
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:17,720
 It's morning.

632
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
 It's morning.

633
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
 It's morning.

634
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,720
 Mr. Baji, you have to go there.

635
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,720
 You have to use the mantap to move.

636
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
 Move.

637
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,720
 How's the result, Angkar?

638
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:47,720
 I'm afraid of being caught by the wrong friends.

639
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
 And they make me feel guilty.

640
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
 I'm so nervous.

641
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
 Angkar!

642
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
 Why are you quiet?

643
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
 Angkar!

644
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
 Answer me!

645
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 Sir.

646
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
 This time,

647
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
 the Mahadasyat is successful.

648
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
 I've managed to provoke all the villagers...

649
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
 to burn all of those.

650
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
 And now, all of those...

651
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,720
 have become grilled meat, sir.

652
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
 (The fire is burning)

653
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:31,720
 Did you see it yourself when it died?

654
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,720
 No, sir.

655
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
 But...

656
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
 it can't be successful.

657
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,720
 Because I've burned it with eternal fire.

658
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
 And eternal fire can't be extinguished, sir.

659
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
 Idiot!

660
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
 Now, go back to your place.

661
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
 Make sure you stay there.

662
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,720
 And bring the body here.

663
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,720
 Yes, sir.

664
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
 Okay, sir.

665
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
 Wait, sir.

666
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
 (The fire is burning)

667
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:32,720
 Sir.

668
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
 Mom.

669
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
 Dad.

670
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
 Mom.

671
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,720
 Sir.

672
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
 Why are they here?

673
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
 How is it?

674
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,720
 The story...

675
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
 is very sad.

676
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
 (The story is sad)

677
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
 In the past,

678
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,720
 I was the son of the 8th Prince.

679
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,720
 The 8th Prince...

680
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
 taught me...

681
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
 to be a cruel and cruel ruler...

682
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,720
 who hurt anyone...

683
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
 without looking back.

684
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
 (The 8th Prince)

685
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
 (The 8th Prince)

686
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
 Spa.

687
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
 Kill him.

688
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
 (The 8th Prince)

689
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:26,720
 Good.

690
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
 (The 8th Prince)

691
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,720
 But in the meantime,

692
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,720
 I have two friends.

693
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,720
 Those two friends are your parents.

694
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,720
 Gama and Aquila.

695
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:53,720
 Actually,

696
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,720
 they often advised me to leave the 8th Prince.

697
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,720
 But I didn't want to.

698
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,720
 Because I wanted to be strong.

699
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,720
 One day,

700
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,720
 I was given a task by the 8th Prince.

701
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,720
 But I failed.

702
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
 When he knew my failure,

703
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
 he was furious.

704
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
 He wanted to kill me.

705
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:37,720
 But suddenly,

706
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
 someone threw a smoke bomb...

707
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
 and killed me.

708
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,720
 That person is Gama.

709
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
 (The 8th Prince)

710
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
 In the end, I decided...

711
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,720
 to leave the 8th Prince.

712
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,720
 But the 8th Prince didn't listen.

713
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
 He was very cruel.

714
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,720
 He was very angry with Gama.

715
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
 And he insisted...

716
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
 that he must destroy Gama and Aquila.

717
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
 (The 8th Prince)

718
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
 (The 8th Prince)

719
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:34,720
 (The 8th Prince)

720
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,720
 (The 8th Prince)

721
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,720
 (The 8th Prince)

722
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
 (The 8th Prince)

723
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,720
 (The 8th Prince)

724
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:03,720
 (The 8th Prince)

725
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:11,720
 (The 8th Prince)

726
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
 (The 8th Prince)

727
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,720
 (The 8th Prince)

728
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,720
 (The 8th Prince)

729
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:34,720
 So, the way I talk in my book...

730
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
 is just a dream?

731
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,720
 We can do it.

732
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:53,720
 We can do it.

733
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
 Why?

734
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,720
 Only my parents were killed.

735
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
 Why didn't I?

736
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,720
 You mean...

737
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,720
 he didn't kill you and let you live?

738
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:24,720
 No one knows about that.

739
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,720
 But one thing is clear.

740
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,720
 When the 8th Prince attacked you...

741
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,720
 a power appeared in you...

742
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,720
 and made the 8th Prince go berserk.

743
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,720
 When he tried to attack you again...

744
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
 he realized...

745
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,720
 that he had lost all his power.

746
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
 (The 8th Prince)

747
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,720
 (The 8th Prince)

748
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:05,720
 (The 8th Prince)

749
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:12,720
 (The 8th Prince)

750
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,720
 (The 8th Prince)

751
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,720
 My magic power is gone.

752
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,720
 This is impossible.

753
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,720
 It's impossible.

754
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,720
 My magic power is gone.

755
00:46:49,720 --> 00:47:02,720
 Then, why did the 8th Prince go berserk...

756
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
 when he attacked me?

757
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,720
 According to Aldebaran...

758
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,720
 that was a love spell.

759
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,720
 Your parents created that spell.

760
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:27,720
 You know Aldebaran?

761
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,720
 Yes.

762
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,720
 He was the teacher of the 5 guardians of the magic.

763
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,720
 When I was still in school...

764
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
 he was a magician.

765
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,720
 Now he's a schoolmaster.

766
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,720
 Oh.

767
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,720
 So, he was a magician?

768
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:59,720
 He was half my age.

769
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,720
 So, that means...

770
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
 you're really old.

771
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
 (The 8th Prince)

772
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,720
 You're so naughty.

773
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,720
 Do you want to hear the rest?

774
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
 Of course.

775
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,720
 Of course.

776
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
 Don't worry.

777
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,720
 The 8th Prince who has lost all his power...

778
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,720
 is trying to find a way...

779
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,720
 to get back all his power.

780
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,720
 He's looking for all kinds of sources.

781
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,720
 And finally he realizes...

782
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
 that there's a way...

783
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,720
 to get back all his power.

784
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,720
 That is with blood...

785
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
 tears...

786
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,720
 and Alva's sweat.

787
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,720
 Then, why are my parents here?

788
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:15,720
 Gamma, I'm lost.

789
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,720
 I'm lost.

790
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,720
 Gamma.

791
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,720
 Gamma, I'm lost.

792
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,720
 I'm the chain of life.

793
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,720
 Put me in the chamber.

794
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
 (The 8th Prince)

795
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
 I thought...

796
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,720
 this chain of life could heal them.

797
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,720
 But because their wounds are too bad...

798
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,720
 they can't be healed, Alva.

799
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,720
 They can only sleep...

800
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,720
 and can't wake up again.

801
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,720
 This chain of life...

802
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,720
 only supports their lives.

803
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,720
 As far as I know, they can only get married.

804
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,720
 So, my parents...

805
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,720
 only came through a dream?

806
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:50,720
 You said they appeared in your dream?

807
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
 Yes.

808
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
 No wonder.

809
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,720
 They told me to pray...

810
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,720
 and cheer me up.

811
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
 Alva.

812
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,720
 If Gamma and I appear in your dream...

813
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,720
 please ask them...

814
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,720
 what I should do...

815
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,720
 to wake them up.

816
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,720
 Okay.

817
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,720
 I'll be there.

818
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
 Okay.

819
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,720
 Okay.

820
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
 I'll be going now.

821
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,720
 I have unfinished business.

822
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,720
 Sir.

823
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
 Where are you going?

824
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
 I want to meet Ankara.

825
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
 I'm curious about him.

826
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
 Why is he attacking me?

827
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
 We used to be friends.

828
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
 Don't meet him.

829
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,720
 He's the 8th Prince's son.

830
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,720
 Ankara is the 8th Prince's son?

831
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
 Yes.

832
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,720
 They're getting stronger.

833
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
 Because they got...

834
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,720
 my tears, sweat, and blood.

835
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:21,720
 All of them must have been burned to ashes.

836
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
 But...

837
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,720
 I have to go back to Ankara.

838
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,720
 (Gamma's dream)

839
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:54,720
 I'm going to war.

840
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,720
 The 8th Prince won't be able to differentiate.

841
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:10,720
 Look.

842
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,720
 This is his body.

843
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,720
 He's already become a hero.

844
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,720
 I'm dead.

845
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,720
 Maybe it's not my destiny.

846
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
 I'm going there.

847
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
 I won't let him get away with it.

848
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:44,720
 I finally defeated him.

849
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,720
 What's wrong with you?

850
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,720
 Who ordered you to kill him?

851
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,720
 I'm sorry, sir.

852
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,720
 Guys, someone's coming.

853
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
 Don't tell me...

854
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,720
 it's Professor Ankara.

855
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,720
 As soon as the door is opened,

856
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,720
 we'll attack Professor Ankara with the TV.

857
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,720
 Okay?

858
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
 Okay.

859
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
 Let's go.

860
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,720
 Let's go in.

861
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,720
 Don't lock the door.

862
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,720
 TV!

863
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,720
 Professor Burua!

864
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,720
 Professor Burua?

865
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,720
 What's going on?

866
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
 I'm sorry, Professor.

867
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,720
 Shut up, Professor!

868
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,720
 Shut up, all of you!

869
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,720
 Let's go back to the room.

870
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
 No one can go back.

871
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,720
 Shut up!

872
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,720
 Professor Burua,

873
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,720
 why are you here?

874
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,720
 Shut up!

875
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:36,720
 What's going on?

876
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
 Panji.

877
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,720
 This must be your doing.

878
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,720
 You must have ordered the kids to attack me.

879
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,720
 Right?

880
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,720
 Don't you dare accuse me.

881
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:56,720
 Professor Burua,

882
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,720
 I'm sorry.

883
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
 We didn't mean to.

884
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
 We thought...

885
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,720
 the professor was Professor Ankara.

886
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,720
 Yes, sir.

887
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,720
 We thought he was Professor Ankara.

888
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
 So, we avoided it.

889
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,720
 Yes, sir.

890
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
 We avoided it.

891
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,720
 (Professor Burua, what are you doing here?)

892
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,720
 I was ordered by Professor Aldebaran...

893
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,720
 to come here...

894
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,720
 and pick all of you up...

895
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
 to go back to school.

896
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,720
 What?

897
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,720
 So, Professor Burua came here to pick us up?

898
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
 Yes.

899
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,720
 (Professor Burua, what are you doing here?)

900
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,720
 (I'm still here to protect you.)

901
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,720
 (Or am I going to Professor Burua?)

902
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

903
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

904
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

905
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

906
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

907
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

908
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

909
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

910
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,720
 We will eliminate Aldebaran.

911
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,720
 And I will promote you as the head of the magic school.

912
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:26,720
 I order you...

913
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,720
 to pack your things...

914
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,720
 and come with me to the magic school.

915
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
 I'm sorry, Professor.

916
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
 I don't want to.

917
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
 I don't want to go home.

918
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
 Alva, I remind you.

919
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,720
 You are still a student.

920
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,720
 I am your teacher.

921
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
 And I am responsible for your safety.

922
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,720
 So, you have to come with me.

923
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,720
 Tole, Vega, Pelita, Ray.

924
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
 Let's go.

925
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
 We don't want to.

926
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,720
 I don't want to go home either.

927
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
 I want to stay here.

928
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,720
 We don't want to.

929
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720
 I don't want to either.

930
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,720
 Yes, Professor.

931
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,720
 We are being forced to eat.

932
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,720
 We only have three meals.

933
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,720
 We are not full, Professor.

934
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,720
 Professor, we have an important mission here.

935
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,720
 To all good people.

936
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,720
 Panji.

937
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,720
 I know.

938
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,720
 This must be your doing.

939
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
 You told the kids to stay here.

940
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,720
 You brainwashed them, right?

941
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
 No, no, no, Sir.

942
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,720
 I am the one who is wrong.

943
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,720
 I told you.

944
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
 Don't just accuse me.

945
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,720
 Now, it's clear.

946
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,720
 They all prefer to be with me...

947
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,720
 than with you.

948
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,720
 We still have unfinished business.

949
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,720
 You'll see.

950
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
 Alva, let's go home.

951
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,720
 No. / Come on.

952
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,720
 No, Sir.

953
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,720
 I don't want to go home.

954
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,720
 Shut up. You have to come with me.

955
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
 No, Sir. I don't want to go home.

956
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
 Enough, you two.

957
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,720
 Let Alva go.

958
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
 Let them go. Go home by yourselves.

959
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,720
 I'm warning you.

960
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,720
 Don't get involved in my business.

961
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,720
 Alva, let's go home.

962
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
 The other kids, let's go home.

963
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,720
 Professor, don't go there.

964
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,720
 Yes, Sir. Don't go there.

965
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,720
 I don't want to go home with you.

966
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,720
 I want to stay here with Mr. Banci.

967
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,720
 I'm sorry, Sir.

968
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,720
 I still have unfinished business here.

969
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:42,720
 Alright.

970
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,720
 If you want it this way,

971
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,720
 Alva,

972
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,720
 I'll let you stay here.

973
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,720
 But on one condition.

974
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,720
 What is it, Sir?

975
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,720
 You have to compete against me.

976
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:16,720
 If you lose,

977
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,720
 you and the others have to take me back to the magic school.

978
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
 But if you win,

979
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:30,720
 I'll let you stay here with Mr. Banci.

980
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:41,720
 What do you say?

981
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
 I'm in.

982
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,720
 If you don't want to compete against me,

983
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,720
 I'll consider you surrender.

984
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,720
 And that means you failed.

985
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,720
 And because of that,

986
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,720
 you and the others have to go to the magic school.

987
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,720
 Come on, kids. Let's go home.

988
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,720
 I want to compete.

989
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:11,720
 Alva wants to compete?

990
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,720
 Oh, God.

991
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,720
 You're just looking for trouble.

992
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
 Mr. Banci is dead, Sir.

993
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,720
 So, what's our next plan?

994
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,720
 I'll move on to the second round.

995
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,720
 But before that,

996
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,720
 I'll give you a present, Angkara.

997
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,720
 Because you've done a great job on your mission.

998
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,720
 What do you want, Angkara?

999
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
 I'll give you a present.

1000
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
 I want you to be a good boy.

1001
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,720
 I want you to be a good boy.

1002
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,720
 I want you to be a good boy.

1003
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
 What do you want, Angkara?

1004
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,720
 I'll grant your wish.

1005
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,720
 I want to be the head of the magic school, Sir.

1006
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,720
 What a coincidence, Angkara.

1007
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,720
 That's what I've been thinking about.

1008
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,720
 Then,

1009
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,720
 we'll send Aldebaran to the fire prison.

1010
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,720
 And I'll make you the head of the magic school, Angkara.

1011
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,720
 Thank you, Sir.

1012
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,720
 Finally,

1013
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,720
 my chance to destroy Aldebaran as the head of the magic school has come.

1014
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,720
 As the head of the magic school of Mendiamkage Sayang,

1015
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,720
 I want to make the final vote

1016
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,720
 to decide who deserves to be the head of the magic school.

1017
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
 (VOTE)

1018
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,720
 Please.

 The current position

 for Professor Aldebaran and Professor Angkara

1039
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,720
 is the same.

1040
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,720
 There is only one vote left.

1041
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,720
 Please, Professor Agni.

1042
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:05,720
 I will win, because Agni will choose me.

 Long live, Professor Aldebaran!

1061
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,720
 Why did you choose Aldebaran?

1062
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,720
 Because you are my future wife's candidate.

1063
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
 Angkara,

1064
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,720
 we do have a close relationship.

1065
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,720
 And the school's head's choice

1066
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,720
 has nothing to do with our relationship.

1067
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,720
 I'm sure,

1068
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,720
 that Aldebaran can be a good school's head.

1069
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,720
 So, you mean

1070
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
 I'm not good?

1071
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
 No.

1072
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,720
 That's not what I mean.

1073
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,720
 I'm disappointed in you.

1074
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:44,720
 Take this!

1075
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,720
 Sir!

1076
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,720
 We can do it!

1077
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:03,720
 We can do it!

1078
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,720
 Now, attention!

1079
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,720
 Step back.

1080
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,720
 The third round.

1081
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,720
 The match starts now.

1082
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,720
 Round one.

1083
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:28,720
 One.

1084
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,720
 Two.

1085
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,720
 Three.

1086
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:40,720
 Finish him!

1087
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
 Sir!

1088
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:56,720
 It's just a small match.

1089
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,720
 It seems,

1090
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,720
 no one supports me.

1091
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,720
 Can I have a round of applause for my first round?

1092
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,720
 We are a strong team.

1093
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
 We don't want to be a burden.

1094
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
 Yes.

1095
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,720
 We are a strong team.

1096
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,720
 I don't want to be a traitor.

1097
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:23,720
 What's that?

1098
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,720
 Yes.

1099
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
 Let's just give it a try.

1100
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,720
 We are at risk.

1101
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,720
 Yes.

1102
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,720
 Good morning, kids.

1103
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,720
 Good morning, sir.

1104
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,720
 You might be wondering about the writing in front of you.

1105
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,720
 Here's the thing.

1106
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,720
 Our school will have a selection.

1107
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:55,720
 Who among you has the ability and is ready to fight?

1108
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:02,720
 The chosen one will be part of the Al-Nibbar squad.

1109
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,720
 The mission of the Al-Nibbar squad is...

1110
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,720
 First, you must be ready to attack the magic school.

1111
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:20,720
 Second, you must be ready to destroy the Dark Lord.

1112
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,720
 The Dark Lord?

1113
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,720
 Yes.

1114
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,720
 That's right.

1115
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,720
 So, from now on,

1116
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,720
 we can't just randomly choose a kid to be a part of the squad.

1117
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,720
 We must select him correctly.

1118
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
 That's right, kids.

1119
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,720
 What Professor Agni said is true.

1120
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,720
 That's right.

1121
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,720
 This is my chance to be a champion.

1122
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,720
 While Alpha is gone.

1123
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,720
 I'm in!

1124
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
 Me too!

1125
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,720
 Mommy, are you sure you want to join?

1126
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,720
 You said you wanted to join the Al-Nibbar squad.

1127
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,720
 Are you sure you want to join?

1128
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,720
 You ran away when we fought the raptor.

1129
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,720
 Just you wait.

1130
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,720
 I'll fight the Dark Lord with all I've got.

1131
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:20,720
 We've arrived at the magic school, sir.

1132
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,720
 Okay, kids.

1133
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,720
 Before we start,

1134
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,720
 let's sing the song,

1135
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,720
 "Mars, the Magic School".

1136
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,720
 Oh, my children.

1137
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,720
 Don't forget the style I taught you.

1138
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,720
 Yes, sir.

1139
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,720
 Kids,

1140
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,720
 since this is the song, "Mars",

1141
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,720
 you must be excited to sing it.

1142
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,720
 Yes, sir.

1143
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,720
 Good.

1144
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,720
 Let's start on three.

1145
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,720
 One, two, three.

1146
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,720
 Show your spirit,

1147
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,720
 get your friends ready.

1148
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:06,720
 Run, jump, and get on the stars.

1149
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,720
 Be brave,

1150
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,720
 don't give up.

1151
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,720
 Chase your dreams.

1152
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,720
 You,

1153
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,720
 if you become the head of the school here,

1154
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,720
 you change the song.

1155
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,720
 They all must be my followers.

1156
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,720
 Yes, sir.

1157
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,720
 I'll make this school the second headquarter.

1158
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:40,720
 Just watch me.

1159
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:46,720
 You'll know that I'm better at making a school than a war.

1160
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,720
 [Mars, the Magic School]

1161
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,720
 My children,

1162
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
 try to imitate me.

1163
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,720
 Ahai.

1164
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,720
 Give me a smile.

1165
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,720
 How is this,

1166
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,720
 the students of the same grade?

1167
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,720
 How can you beat the 8th grade?

1168
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,720
 You've already lost against the 7th grade.

1169
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,720
 Whose voice is that?

1170
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,720
 That's the voice.

1171
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,720
 That's not the voice.

1172
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,720
 [The Magic School]

1173
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,720
 Your task now is to find the right person.

1174
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,720
 Okay, sir.

1175
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:28,720
 Show your spirit,

1176
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,720
 get your friends ready.

1177
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:38,720
 Run, jump, and get on the stars.

1178
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,720
 Be brave,

1179
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,720
 don't give up.

1180
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:53,720
 Chase your dreams.

1181
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,720
 Go, go, go,

1182
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,720
 reach all your dreams.

1183
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,720
 Go, go, go,

1184
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
 never stop.

1185
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,720
 Go, go, go,

1186
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,720
 fight with your heart.

1187
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,720
 Go, go, go,

1188
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,720
 make yourself proud.

1189
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,720
 Go, go, go,

1190
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,720
 let's dream.

1191
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,720
 Go, go, go,

1192
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,720
 we will.
