I don't want all my plans to be ruined

We'll wait until the full moon

Because now is the right time for us to fight

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Think!

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What have you done?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Who are you?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Who are you really?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're the one who stole my parents' house

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't ask me!

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not lying!

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm the one who stole it!

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, I'm not!

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And they're my parents!

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We don't have much time

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We only have 6 hours

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I don't want to see Serigala turn into a pancake

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you understand?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, sir

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm ready

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Action!

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Serigala, I'm coming!

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Where are you?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm here, I'm here!

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm coming!

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Serigala!

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Boss, let's go!

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm here!

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What the power!

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Cut the rope!

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Sir, don't pull me!

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to break the rock!

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can't do it alone, right?

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm coming!

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sir!

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Help me!

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There's a thief!

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's wrong?

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was attacked, sir!

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What was attacked?

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I was attacked by Serigala's monster, sir!

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Serigala?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Serigala came out of my parents' house

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If so, let's take him to the village doctor!

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go!

Professor

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If that's the situation,

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In my opinion,

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The only way is

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Starting tomorrow,

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I will train the children

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So they are more prepared to fight

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But can they do it, Megantara?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They are brave children

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
At home, I won't leave them alone

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If necessary,

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm ready to sacrifice my life

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Until the last drop of blood for them

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But there's one more problem, Megantara

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's the problem, professor?

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
About Alfa

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Until now

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I haven't heard from Vega

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm afraid

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They have a problem with me

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000

Professor

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Can we split the task?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Me, Professor Titan

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And Professor Agni

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We train the children at school

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Meanwhile,

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Professor Purwa

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I think

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He's the right person

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
To find Vega and his friends to my place

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
[Footsteps]

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
See?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We're left with just a little bit of blood

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We're done!

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Give us more, Vega!

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If he wants to,

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He can have our blood!

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Where are we going?

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're the only one who can help us

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Go!

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go, Srigala!

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I know the way!

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What's the lock?

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a secret

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you're Srigala,

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You'll be human again

Sunbeam?

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh no

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's only 12 o'clock

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So,

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We have 6 hours left

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh no!

I can't do it

I can't be Srigala

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It seems your wound is not too bad

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You should just rest

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And don't think too much

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All of this

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Because of Srigala

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We can't just be quiet

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We have to discuss it

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If not

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There will be other victims

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But how?

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What about Srigala?

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Listen to me

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I am a good butcher

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I know

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How to defeat Srigala

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Srigala is afraid of fire

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And if we attack him

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I burn him with eternal fire

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Which comes from my butcher's axe

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then he will die

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's right

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We should gather men

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And burn him

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Oh my god

193
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Are you ready, Rita?

194
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
I don't know

195
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Happy birthday

196
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Rita, what if he's a ghost?

197
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
What about my parents?

198
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't know

199
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
I'll look for another one

200
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Wait, let's hide first

201
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
How do we hide?

202
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Someone's down there

203
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Let's go

204
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:58,320
[Ghosts]

205
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm scared

206
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Calm down, honey

207
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Actually, a ghost can be a good pet

208
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
As long as you can touch its nose

209
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:20,320
[Ghosts]

210
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
My dad said

211
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,320
If you want to pet a ghost, you have to touch its nose

212
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
What?

213
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Don't be ridiculous

214
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes

215
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Hold it, Rita

216
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Are you crazy?

217
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Just hold it

218
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Don't be ridiculous

219
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,320
What are you doing?

220
00:12:48,320 --> 00:13:40,320
[Ghosts]

221
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
It's a real ghost

222
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Yes, we have a ghost

223
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
It's scary

224
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I want to try

225
00:13:48,320 --> 00:14:00,320
[Ghosts]

226
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
I'll look for another one

227
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
[Ghosts]

228
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
I'll go

229
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
[Ghosts]

230
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
I want to touch it

231
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
[Ghosts]

232
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:25,520
Now, I will try some music!

233
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:38,000
One, two, now stay still!

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Yeah! We're the champions!

235
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
One, two, three!

236
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
We're the champions!

237
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Yeah!

238
00:14:50,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Let's burn that monster!

239
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Hey, Panji, get out!

240
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Panji, get out!

241
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Get out!

242
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Panji, what's going on?

243
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Panji, get out!

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Get out!

245
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Panji, get out!

246
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Panji, you can't be a monster!

247
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
You can't get out!

248
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Panji, get out!

249
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Professor Adebar,

250
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
What do you want?

251
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I want you to come to my house.

252
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Why would I go there, Professor?

253
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Until now,

254
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Vega and his friends haven't returned.

255
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
And this is what worries me.

256
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
You know how I am.

257
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm afraid Vega and his friends will have a problem there.

258
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
But why should I, Professor?

259
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Why don't you just hold the reins?

260
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Or Professor Yasmin, or Professor Raki?

261
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
You know that I've never liked Panji.

262
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
He's a weirdo.

263
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
I know.

264
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
You're the only one who can go there, Professor.

265
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Because the other professors,

266
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Megantara, Yasmin, Agni, and Titan,

267
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,720
They have other tasks for the kids.

268
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
And one more thing,

269
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
You're the only one who can hurt Panji.

270
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
What do you think, Professor?

271
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Are you ready?

272
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Yes.

273
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Whatever you say, Professor.

274
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
I will do it.

275
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I'll count to three.

276
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
If you don't come out, I'll slam the door.

277
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Huh?

278
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Where is this?

279
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Everyone's waiting for me to come out.

280
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm scared.

281
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
One.

282
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Two.

283
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Three.

284
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Go back there.

285
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Run!

286
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Let's chase them.

287
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Don't run!

288
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Let's go.

289
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Be careful.

290
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Don't run!

291
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Where do you think you're going?

292
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Let's go.

293
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Where are you going?

294
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Just burn them.

295
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Let's go.

296
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Burn them.

297
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Don't burn them!

298
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
That's a good story.

299
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
This story is not bad.

300
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,720
There's no good story.

301
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Let's burn them.

302
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Is he really a good person?

303
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
He's a good person. / We don't know.

304
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Let's run away.

305
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I agree.

306
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Let's run away.

307
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
We should wait for this story.

308
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Let's go.

309
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
We should wait for this story.

310
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
What if something happens to us?

311
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,720
We won't be able to live.

312
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Let's go.

313
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
It's quite far.

314
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Let's just fight them.

315
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
How?

316
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Just run.

317
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Burn them.

318
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Let's run.

319
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Don't let them get away.

320
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
People.

321
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Don't be afraid to attack those kids.

322
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
They're evil.

323
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
No.

324
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
That's a lie.

325
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
It's true.

326
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,720
He's evil.

327
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
You all are his followers.

328
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
You're a slanderer.

329
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
That's right.

330
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,720
People.

331
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Don't believe him.

332
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Kids.

333
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Who believes you?

334
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,720
People.

335
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Let's attack them.

336
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Let's solve this problem.

337
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Catch and burn those kids.

338
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Don't.

339
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Be a man.

340
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
5 minutes later.

341
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,720
We got caught.

342
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Five minutes.

343
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Five years.

344
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Don't be stupid.

345
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
This can be a true story.

346
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
We should pity them.

347
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Enough.

348
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Let's talk later.

349
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Let's go.

350
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Run.

351
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Where are we going?

352
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Let's hide in the well.

353
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Let's go.

354
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:54,720
It's so hard to find them.

355
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Luckily, this is a good place.

356
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,720
If not, I won't be able to sleep.

357
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Don't be noisy.

358
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
They'll come here.

359
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Before they come here.

360
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Let's just hide.

361
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,720
How many branches are there?

362
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Five minutes later.

363
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:35,720
What's wrong?

364
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm not afraid.

365
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
I won't let them destroy me.

366
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Where are the kids?

367
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Everyone.

368
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
I told you.

369
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
They're the kids.

370
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
They're evil.

371
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
They made us stupid.

372
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
We shouldn't waste our time.

373
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Let's chase them.

374
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Let's go.

375
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I'm sure they're still here.

376
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Let's look for them somewhere else.

377
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Maybe they're not here.

378
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Let's look for them.

379
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Luckily, we're not caught.

380
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
If they're far away, let's go here.

381
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Here.

382
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Shh.

383
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,720
They can be gone.

384
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Is that a sound?

385
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Yes.

386
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I think the sound is coming from here.

387
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Where?

388
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
I think it's coming from there.

389
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Let's go.

390
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
One, two, three.

391
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,720
You're going to pay for this.

392
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Wait.

393
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Let me check.

394
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
What's that?

395
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
"Police"

396
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Let's go, Becky.

397
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:39,720
You can't go anywhere.

398
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Don't leave me, Becky.

399
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Let's go.

400
00:25:51,720 --> 00:26:08,720
You can't escape this time.

401
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
"Police"

402
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:21,720
People.

403
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Listen to me.

404
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I'm Angkara.

405
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
A good slayer.

406
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,720
And now...

407
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
I'm going to burn this evil tribe...

408
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
with eternal fire.

409
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
And as you know,

410
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,720
this eternal fire...

411
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
can't be extinguished by the magic of people.

412
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Let me go.

413
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Let go of that witch.

414
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Don't burn it again.

415
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Let go of that witch.

416
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
And now,

417
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
it's time for me to burn her.

418
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
No.

419
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Let go of that witch.

420
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
"Police"

421
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Let's go.

422
00:27:46,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Let go of that witch.

423
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Feel this.

424
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
My friends,

425
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
now you can go.

426
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Let me see the magic of this witch.

427
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Thank you, good slayer.

428
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Let's go home.

429
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Let's go.

430
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
"Police"

431
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Let go of that witch.

432
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:07,720
"Police"

433
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
And now, the second task.

434
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Which is to bring you, Alfa.

435
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,720
I will give you to the eighth witch.

436
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,720
So that you will be consumed by her.

437
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Let us go.

438
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:19,720
"Police"

439
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Attack the green man.

440
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Okay.

441
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Three.

442
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Attack him.

443
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
"Police"

444
00:30:46,720 --> 00:31:10,720
The witch is holding on.

445
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Where is she?

446
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
I'll go there.

447
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Pavanam.

448
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Let me try.

449
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Don't cut the water.

450
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
"Police"

451
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Let me try.

452
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,720
"Police"

453
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Hey, you.

454
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
You're being funny.

455
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Stop fighting.

456
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Fire!

457
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:24,720
We will win.

458
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Just like what the professor said.

459
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
We will win.

460
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Baby, baby.

461
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
We will burn it.

462
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Help!

463
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,720
The fire is so strong.

464
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
This is eternal fire.

465
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
It will not be extinguished.

466
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
What should we do?

467
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Baby, hold on.

468
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Now, go back to your place.

469
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Make sure you're safe.

470
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
And bring the body here.

471
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:17,720
"We can do it"

472
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Yes.

473
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,720
He can use the flashlight.

474
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
He can go from there.

475
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
No way.

476
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
He can't talk.

477
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,720
You're right.

478
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,720
He has to move.

479
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,720
So, we have to change him to be Mr. Panji.

480
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
But, how?

481
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Yes.

482
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
He can't talk.

483
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,720
If he's exposed to the sun, we have to make him talk.

484
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Make him talk?

485
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
No way.

486
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,720
How can we make him talk?

487
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Well...

488
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
We have to try.

489
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Let's try to find a book.

490
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
How can we do it?

491
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
It's too long.

492
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,720
I can't read.

493
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
I know.

494
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I love you, Blacky.

495
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Oh, right.

496
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
I know how.

497
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Wait a minute.

498
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Putri Bintang!

499
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Help me!

500
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I'm lost! Putri Bintang!

501
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Putri Bintang!

502
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Alfa?

503
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Alfa, Plita, everyone.

504
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
How are you?

505
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Alfa!

506
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:21,720
There's fire.

507
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Are you having fun?

508
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
It's so fun.

509
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
It's not a fire.

510
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
It's a serigala.

511
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Serigala is me, a human.

512
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Oh, my God.

513
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
He's about to be burned.

514
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I want to ask you for a favor.

515
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Can you make the sun appear?

516
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
If there's a sun, it will turn into a human.

517
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:51,720
I want to go up. Can you do it?

518
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,720
But don't take too long.

519
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I'm sorry, Blacky.

520
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm so sorry, guys.

521
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,720
I can't help you.

522
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Because I don't know the sun.

523
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
It appears in the morning.

524
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
If I'm here at night...

525
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh, no.

526
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
We can't.

527
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Can you make it?

528
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,720
How?

529
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Oh, I know.

530
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
I can call my friends, the moon and the stars,

531
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
to hide.

532
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
So, the sun can come earlier.

533
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Okay, let's do it.

534
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Let's do it.

535
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Okay.

536
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Friends, the moon and the stars,

537
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
let's hide.

538
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
So, the sun can come earlier.

539
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Okay.

540
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:21,720
It's morning.

541
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Mr. Baji, you have to go there.

542
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,720
You have to use the mantap to move.

543
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Move.

544
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,720
How's the result, Angkar?

545
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm afraid of being caught by the wrong friends.

546
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
And they make me feel guilty.

547
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I'm so nervous.

548
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Angkar!

549
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Why are you quiet?

550
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Angkar!

551
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Answer me!

552
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Sir.

553
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
This time,

554
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
the Mahadasyat is successful.

555
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
I've managed to provoke all the villagers...

556
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
to burn all of those.

557
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
And now, all of those...

558
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,720
have become grilled meat, sir.

559
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
(The fire is burning)

560
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Did you see it yourself when it died?

561
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,720
No, sir.

562
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
But...

563
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
it can't be successful.

564
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Because I've burned it with eternal fire.

565
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
And eternal fire can't be extinguished, sir.

566
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Idiot!

567
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Now, go back to your place.

568
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Make sure you stay there.

569
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,720
And bring the body here.

570
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Yes, sir.

571
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Okay, sir.

572
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Wait, sir.

573
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
(The fire is burning)

574
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Sir.

575
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Mom.

576
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Dad.

577
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Mom.

578
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,720
Sir.

579
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Why are they here?

580
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
How is it?

581
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,720
The story...

582
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
is very sad.

583
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
(The story is sad)

584
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
In the past,

585
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I was the son of the 8th Prince.

586
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,720
The 8th Prince...

587
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
taught me...

588
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
to be a cruel and cruel ruler...

589
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,720
who hurt anyone...

590
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
without looking back.

591
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,720
(The 8th Prince)

592
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Spa.

593
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
Kill him.

594
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
(The 8th Prince)

595
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:26,720
Good.

596
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
(The 8th Prince)

597
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,720
But in the meantime,

598
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,720
I have two friends.

599
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Those two friends are your parents.

600
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Gama and Aquila.

601
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Actually,

602
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,720
they often advised me to leave the 8th Prince.

603
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,720
But I didn't want to.

604
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Because I wanted to be strong.

605
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,720
One day,

606
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,720
I was given a task by the 8th Prince.

607
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,720
But I failed.

608
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
When he knew my failure,

609
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
he was furious.

610
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
He wanted to kill me.

611
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:37,720
But suddenly,

612
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
someone threw a smoke bomb...

613
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
and killed me.

614
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,720
That person is Gama.

615
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
(The 8th Prince)

616
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
In the end, I decided...

617
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,720
to leave the 8th Prince.

618
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,720
But the 8th Prince didn't listen.

619
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
He was very cruel.

620
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,720
He was very angry with Gama.

621
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
And he insisted...

622
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
that he must destroy Gama and Aquila.

623
00:43:20,720 --> 00:44:25,720
(The 8th Prince)

624
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:34,720
So, the way I talk in my book...

625
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
is just a dream?

626
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:53,720
We can do it.

627
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
Why?

628
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Only my parents were killed.

629
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
Why didn't I?

630
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,720
You mean...

631
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,720
he didn't kill you and let you live?

632
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:24,720
No one knows about that.

633
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,720
But one thing is clear.

634
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,720
When the 8th Prince attacked you...

635
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,720
a power appeared in you...

636
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,720
and made the 8th Prince go berserk.

637
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,720
When he tried to attack you again...

638
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
he realized...

639
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,720
that he had lost all his power.

640
00:45:49,720 --> 00:46:15,720
(The 8th Prince)

641
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,720
My magic power is gone.

642
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,720
This is impossible.

643
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,720
It's impossible.

644
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,720
My magic power is gone.

645
00:46:49,720 --> 00:47:02,720
Then, why did the 8th Prince go berserk...

646
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
when he attacked me?

647
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,720
According to Aldebaran...

648
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,720
that was a love spell.

649
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,720
Your parents created that spell.

650
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:27,720
You know Aldebaran?

651
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Yes.

652
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,720
He was the teacher of the 5 guardians of the magic.

653
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,720
When I was still in school...

654
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
he was a magician.

655
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,720
Now he's a schoolmaster.

656
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,720
Oh.

657
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,720
So, he was a magician?

658
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:59,720
He was half my age.

659
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,720
So, that means...

660
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
you're really old.

661
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
(The 8th Prince)

662
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,720
You're so naughty.

663
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,720
Do you want to hear the rest?

664
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,720
Of course.

665
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Don't worry.

666
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,720
The 8th Prince who has lost all his power...

667
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,720
is trying to find a way...

668
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,720
to get back all his power.

669
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,720
He's looking for all kinds of sources.

670
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,720
And finally he realizes...

671
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
that there's a way...

672
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,720
to get back all his power.

673
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,720
That is with blood...

674
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
tears...

675
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,720
and Alfa's sweat.

676
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,720
Then, why are my parents here?

677
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:15,720
Gamma, I'm lost.

678
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,720
I'm lost.

679
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Gamma.

680
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,720
Gamma, I'm lost.

681
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,720
I'm the chain of life.

682
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Put me in the chamber.

683
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
(The 8th Prince)

684
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
I thought...

685
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,720
this chain of life could heal them.

686
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,720
But because their wounds are too bad...

687
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,720
they can't be healed, Alfa.

688
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,720
They can only sleep...

689
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,720
and can't wake up again.

690
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,720
This chain of life...

691
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,720
only supports their lives.

692
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,720
As far as I know, they can only get married.

693
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,720
So, my parents...

694
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,720
only came through a dream?

695
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:50,720
You said they appeared in your dream?

696
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
Yes.

697
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
No wonder.

698
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,720
They told me to pray...

699
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,720
and cheer me up.

700
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
Alfa.

701
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,720
If Gamma and I appear in your dream...

702
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,720
please ask them...

703
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,720
what I should do...

704
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,720
to wake them up.

705
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,720
Okay.

706
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,720
I'll be there.

707
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,720
Okay.

708
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
I'll be going now.

709
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,720
I have unfinished business.

710
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,720
Sir.

711
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Where are you going?

712
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
I want to meet Ankara.

713
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
I'm curious about him.

714
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Why is he attacking me?

715
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
We used to be friends.

716
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
Don't meet him.

717
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,720
He's the 8th Prince's son.

718
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,720
Ankara is the 8th Prince's son?

719
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
Yes.

720
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,720
They're getting stronger.

721
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
Because they got...

722
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,720
my tears, sweat, and blood.

723
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:21,720
All of them must have been burned to ashes.

724
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
But...

725
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,720
I have to go back to Ankara.

726
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,720
(Gamma's dream)

727
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:54,720
I'm going to war.

728
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,720
The 8th Prince won't be able to differentiate.

729
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Look.

730
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,720
This is his body.

731
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,720
He's already become a hero.

732
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,720
I'm dead.

733
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,720
Maybe it's not my destiny.

734
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
I'm going there.

735
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
I won't let him get away with it.

736
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:44,720
I finally defeated him.

737
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,720
What's wrong with you?

738
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,720
Who ordered you to kill him?

739
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,720
I'm sorry, sir.

740
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,720
Guys, someone's coming.

741
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
Don't tell me...

742
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,720
it's Professor Ankara.

743
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,720
As soon as the door is opened,

744
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,720
we'll attack Professor Ankara with the TV.

745
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,720
Okay?

746
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
Okay.

747
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
Let's go.

748
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,720
Let's go in.

749
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,720
Don't lock the door.

750
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,720
TV!

751
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,720
Professor Burua!

752
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,720
Professor Burua?

753
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,720
What's going on?

754
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
I'm sorry, Professor.

755
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,720
Shut up, Professor!

756
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,720
Shut up, all of you!

757
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,720
Let's go back to the room.

758
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
No one can go back.

759
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,720
Shut up!

760
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,720
Professor Burua,

761
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,720
why are you here?

762
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,720
Shut up!

763
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:36,720
What's going on?

764
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Panji.

765
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,720
This must be your doing.

766
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,720
You must have ordered the kids to attack me.

767
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,720
Right?

768
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Don't you dare accuse me.

769
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:56,720
Professor Burua,

770
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,720
I'm sorry.

771
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
We didn't mean to.

772
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
We thought...

773
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,720
the professor was Professor Ankara.

774
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,720
Yes, sir.

775
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,720
We thought he was Professor Ankara.

776
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
So, we avoided it.

777
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Yes, sir.

778
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
We avoided it.

779
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,720
(Professor Burua, what are you doing here?)

780
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,720
I was ordered by Professor Aldebaran...

781
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,720
to come here...

782
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,720
and pick all of you up...

783
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
to go back to school.

784
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,720
What?

785
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,720
So, Professor Burua came here to pick us up?

786
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
Yes.

787
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,720
(Professor Burua, what are you doing here?)

788
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,720
(I'm still here to protect you.)

789
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,720
(Or am I going to Professor Burua?)

790
00:56:44,720 --> 00:57:05,720
We will eliminate Aldebaran.

791
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,720
And I will promote you as the head of the magic school.

792
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:26,720
I order you...

793
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,720
to pack your things...

794
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,720
and come with me to the magic school.

795
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
I'm sorry, Professor.

796
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
I don't want to.

797
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
I don't want to go home.

798
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Alfa, I remind you.

799
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,720
You are still a student.

800
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,720
I am your teacher.

801
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
And I am responsible for your safety.

802
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,720
So, you have to come with me.

803
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,720
Tole, Vega, Pelita, Ray.

804
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
Let's go.

805
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
We don't want to.

806
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,720
I don't want to go home either.

807
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
I want to stay here.

808
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,720
We don't want to.

809
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720
I don't want to either.

810
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,720
Yes, Professor.

811
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,720
We are being forced to eat.

812
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,720
We only have three meals.

813
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,720
We are not full, Professor.

814
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,720
Professor, we have an important mission here.

815
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,720
To all good people.

816
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,720
Panji.

817
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,720
I know.

818
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,720
This must be your doing.

819
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
You told the kids to stay here.

820
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,720
You brainwashed them, right?

821
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
No, no, no, Sir.

822
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,720
I am the one who is wrong.

823
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,720
I told you.

824
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Don't just accuse me.

825
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,720
Now, it's clear.

826
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,720
They all prefer to be with me...

827
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,720
than with you.

828
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,720
We still have unfinished business.

829
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,720
You'll see.

830
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
Alfa, let's go home.

831
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,720
No. / Come on.

832
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,720
No, Sir.

833
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,720
I don't want to go home.

834
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,720
Shut up. You have to come with me.

835
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
No, Sir. I don't want to go home.

836
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
Enough, you two.

837
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,720
Let Alfa go.

838
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
Let them go. Go home by yourselves.

839
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,720
I'm warning you.

840
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,720
Don't get involved in my business.

841
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Alfa, let's go home.

842
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
The other kids, let's go home.

843
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,720
Professor, don't go there.

844
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,720
Yes, Sir. Don't go there.

845
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,720
I don't want to go home with you.

846
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,720
I want to stay here with Mr. Banci.

847
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,720
I'm sorry, Sir.

848
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,720
I still have unfinished business here.

849
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:42,720
Alright.

850
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,720
If you want it this way,

851
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,720
Alfa,

852
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,720
I'll let you stay here.

853
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,720
But on one condition.

854
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,720
What is it, Sir?

855
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,720
You have to compete against me.

856
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:16,720
If you lose,

857
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,720
you and the others have to take me back to the magic school.

858
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
But if you win,

859
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:30,720
I'll let you stay here with Mr. Banci.

860
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:41,720
What do you say?

861
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
I'm in.

862
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,720
If you don't want to compete against me,

863
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,720
I'll consider you surrender.

864
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,720
And that means you failed.

865
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,720
And because of that,

866
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,720
you and the others have to go to the magic school.

867
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,720
Come on, kids. Let's go home.

868
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,720
I want to compete.

869
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:11,720
Alfa wants to compete?

870
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,720
Oh, God.

871
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,720
You're just looking for trouble.

872
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
Mr. Banci is dead, Sir.

873
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,720
So, what's our next plan?

874
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,720
I'll move on to the second round.

875
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,720
But before that,

876
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,720
I'll give you a present, Angkara.

877
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Because you've done a great job on your mission.

878
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,720
What do you want, Angkara?

879
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
I'll give you a present.

880
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,720
I want you to be a good boy.

881
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
What do you want, Angkara?

882
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,720
I'll grant your wish.

883
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,720
I want to be the head of the magic school, Sir.

884
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,720
What a coincidence, Angkara.

885
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,720
That's what I've been thinking about.

886
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,720
Then,

887
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,720
we'll send Aldebaran to the fire prison.

888
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,720
And I'll make you the head of the magic school, Angkara.

889
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,720
Thank you, Sir.

890
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,720
Finally,

891
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,720
my chance to destroy Aldebaran as the head of the magic school has come.

892
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,720
As the head of the magic school of Mendiamkage Sayang,

893
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,720
I want to make the final vote

894
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,720
to decide who deserves to be the head of the magic school.

895
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
(VOTE)

896
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,720
Please.

897
01:02:48,720 --> 01:03:41,720
(VOTE)

898
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,720
The current position

899
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,720
for Professor Aldebaran and Professor Angkara

900
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,720
is the same.

901
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,720
There is only one vote left.

902
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,720
Please, Professor Agni.

903
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:05,720
I will win, because Agni will choose me.

904
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:28,720
(VOTE)

905
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,720
Professor Agni chooses Professor Aldebaran.

906
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:56,720
(VOTE)

907
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,720
Long live, Professor Aldebaran!

908
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,720
Why did you choose Aldebaran?

909
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,720
Because you are my future wife's candidate.

910
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
Angkara,

911
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,720
we do have a close relationship.

912
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,720
And the school's head's choice

913
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,720
has nothing to do with our relationship.

914
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,720
I'm sure,

915
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,720
that Aldebaran can be a good school's head.

916
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,720
So, you mean

917
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
I'm not good?

918
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
No.

919
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,720
That's not what I mean.

920
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,720
I'm disappointed in you.

921
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:44,720
Take this!

922
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Sir!

923
01:05:48,720 --> 01:06:03,720
We can do it!

924
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,720
Now, attention!

925
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Step back.

926
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,720
The third round.

927
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,720
The match starts now.

928
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,720
Round one.

929
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:28,720
One.

930
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,720
Two.

931
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,720
Three.

932
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:40,720
Finish him!

933
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
Sir!

934
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:56,720
It's just a small match.

935
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,720
It seems,

936
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,720
no one supports me.

937
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,720
Can I have a round of applause for my first round?

938
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,720
We are a strong team.

939
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
We don't want to be a burden.

940
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Yes.

941
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,720
We are a strong team.

942
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,720
I don't want to be a traitor.

943
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:23,720
What's that?

944
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,720
Yes.

945
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
Let's just give it a try.

946
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,720
We are at risk.

947
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,720
Yes.

948
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,720
Good morning, kids.

949
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,720
Good morning, sir.

950
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,720
You might be wondering about the writing in front of you.

951
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,720
Here's the thing.

952
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,720
Our school will have a selection.

953
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:55,720
Who among you has the ability and is ready to fight?

954
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:02,720
The chosen one will be part of the Al-Nibbar squad.

955
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,720
The mission of the Al-Nibbar squad is...

956
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,720
First, you must be ready to attack the magic school.

957
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:20,720
Second, you must be ready to destroy the Dark Lord.

958
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,720
The Dark Lord?

959
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,720
Yes.

960
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,720
That's right.

961
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,720
So, from now on,

962
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,720
we can't just randomly choose a kid to be a part of the squad.

963
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,720
We must select him correctly.

964
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
That's right, kids.

965
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,720
What Professor Agni said is true.

966
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,720
That's right.

967
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,720
This is my chance to be a champion.

968
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,720
While Alpha is gone.

969
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,720
I'm in!

970
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
Me too!

971
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,720
Mommy, are you sure you want to join?

972
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,720
You said you wanted to join the Al-Nibbar squad.

973
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,720
Are you sure you want to join?

974
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,720
You ran away when we fought the raptor.

975
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,720
Just you wait.

976
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,720
I'll fight the Dark Lord with all I've got.

977
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:20,720
We've arrived at the magic school, sir.

978
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Okay, kids.

979
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,720
Before we start,

980
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,720
let's sing the song,

981
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,720
"Mars, the Magic School".

982
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,720
Oh, my children.

983
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,720
Don't forget the style I taught you.

984
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,720
Yes, sir.

985
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,720
Kids,

986
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,720
since this is the song, "Mars",

987
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,720
you must be excited to sing it.

988
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,720
Yes, sir.

989
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,720
Good.

990
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,720
Let's start on three.

991
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,720
One, two, three.

992
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,720
Show your spirit,

993
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,720
get your friends ready.

994
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:06,720
Run, jump, and get on the stars.

995
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,720
Be brave,

996
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,720
don't give up.

997
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,720
Chase your dreams.

998
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,720
You,

999
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,720
if you become the head of the school here,

1000
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,720
you change the song.

1001
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,720
They all must be my followers.

1002
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,720
Yes, sir.

1003
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,720
I'll make this school the second headquarter.

1004
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:40,720
Just watch me.

1005
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:46,720
You'll know that I'm better at making a school than a war.

1006
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,720
[Mars, the Magic School]

1007
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,720
My children,

1008
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
try to imitate me.

1009
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,720
Ahai.

1010
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,720
Give me a smile.

1011
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,720
How is this,

1012
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,720
the students of the same grade?

1013
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,720
How can you beat the 8th grade?

1014
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,720
You've already lost against the 7th grade.

1015
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,720
Whose voice is that?

1016
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,720
That's the voice.

1017
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,720
That's not the voice.

1018
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,720
[The Magic School]

1019
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,720
Your task now is to find the right person.

1020
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Okay, sir.

1021
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:28,720
Show your spirit,

1022
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,720
get your friends ready.

1023
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:38,720
Run, jump, and get on the stars.

1024
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,720
Be brave,

1025
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,720
don't give up.

1026
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:53,720
Chase your dreams.

1027
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,720
Go, go, go,

1028
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,720
reach all your dreams.

1029
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Go, go, go,

1030
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
never stop.

1031
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,720
Go, go, go,

1032
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,720
fight with your heart.

1033
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,720
Go, go, go,

1034
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,720
make yourself proud.

1035
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,720
Go, go, go,

1036
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,720
let's dream.

1037
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,720
Go, go, go,

1038
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,720
we will.
