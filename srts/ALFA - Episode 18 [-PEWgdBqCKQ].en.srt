To be continued...

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, I did it!

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ankara, look at that

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There's Alpha

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It means that with us

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're really a Megatron

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You better go

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let Alpha go

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I won't let Alpha go

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Alpha!

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Attack her, Alpha

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now!

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Team Ninja!

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go, Nek

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ready, Nek

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One, two, three!

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ankara was defeated

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now it's just me

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Alpha

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You won't get away with this

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The door is locked

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This must be a snake from the dark lab

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Calm down

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Open the door

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Try it, Alpha

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Open the door!

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't get in

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's read the mantra together

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not as easy as you think

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I won't let you leave this place

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is a virus!

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm getting stronger

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You two

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Won't be able to take me

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And you, Megantron

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because you're looking for trouble with me

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll kill you first

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Get ready, Megantron

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go, V!

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, Alpha!

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Get back!

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't!

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me face you

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Get back!

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Orphan!

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Nado!

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Get back!

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's wrong, Dad?

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Are you okay?

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm okay

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What's wrong?

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, we have to fight the dark lab, right?

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes, we want to help Alpha

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because the dark lab is really strong

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yo, the dark lab

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Is not a match for us

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We can be a match for them

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't be afraid

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But, I feel sorry for Alpha

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, you're right

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, you want to join us?

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, I'll join you

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, sis

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll join you too

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wait

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're alone in the dark lab

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Be careful

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I want to join you too

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to help Alpha

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to be a hero too

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, you want to join us?

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Go!

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sis!

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Alpha, it's better if you help Megantara

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So, I can face the dark lab

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, Prof

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But, be careful, Prof

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She's very strong

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Seperang!

[The Dark Lab]

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Prof, you're still wounded

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't attack her!

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Calm down

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I haven't lost yet

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Megantara!

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sis!

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wake up, Prof!

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Megantara, wake up!

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wake up, Prof!

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Wake up!

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How did I get here?

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Amazing!

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Professor Ada Barante has woken up

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank God!

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm so happy!

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Professor Ada Barante?

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Forget?

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Professor Ada Barante fainted

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He was attacked by the Dark Lab

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm very, very badly wounded

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Alpha!

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Where's Alpha?

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Alpha and Megantara are still in the Dark Lab, Prof

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Where are the teachers?

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
All teachers, go away, Prof!

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They want to help Alpha and Megantara

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're a villain!

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You've ruined Professor Ada's life!

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is the fate of those who oppose me

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you will have the same fate as them

[The Dark Lab]

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm going to kill you!

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No!

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why is Alpha so strong?

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He can turn my attack back on me

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What do you want, Alpha?

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Answer me, Alpha!

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You don't know?

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is the ring, Barga

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can throw it away

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't, Alpha

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Who knows it might be useful to you

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You better keep it

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000

No

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Whoever wears this ring will be defeated

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I will wear it

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Just like Barga

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No, Alpha!

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Professor Agni!

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Wake up

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank God

Professor Agni

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You've been healed

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can heal because of your help

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where is the Dark Lab?

206
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Tell me where it is

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've defeated it

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What?

209
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know where it's called

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're great, Alva!

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's because of the army

212
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because I have a strong will

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I won't let the Dark Lab hurt my teachers

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you, Alva

We have to help Alva

Alva

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Alva, you're safe!

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
One, two, three

222
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Three, two, two, three!

223
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That means you can't be a hero

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You can be a hero

225
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What hero?

What's going on?

232
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is there another attack?

233
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm bored, you know?

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Men's war, men's war

235
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, we won't have a war this time

236
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We will welcome a new professor

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Who will teach at our school

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, a new professor

His name is Professor Tita

240
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He is a great man

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Very powerful

242
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's why Professor Aldebaran sent us to teach

243
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go

244
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Who is it?

245
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's morning and they're already here

246
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They're disturbing Professor Tita and Danajel

247
00:17:43,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How could this happen?

248
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Please

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,100
if in front of the mirror my face hasn't changed

259
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,100

they must take a net
