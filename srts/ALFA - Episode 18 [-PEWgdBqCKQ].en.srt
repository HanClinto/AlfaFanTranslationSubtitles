1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, I did it!

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ankara, look at that

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There's Alpha

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It means that with us

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're really a Megatron

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You better go

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let Alpha go

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I won't let Alpha go

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Alpha!

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Attack her, Alpha

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now!

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Team Ninja!

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go, Nek

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ready, Nek

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One, two, three!

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ankara was defeated

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now it's just me

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Alpha

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You won't get away with this

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The door is locked

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This must be a snake from the dark lab

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Calm down

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Open the door

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Try it, Alpha

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Open the door!

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't get in

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's read the mantra together

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not as easy as you think

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I won't let you leave this place

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is a virus!

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm getting stronger

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You two

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Won't be able to take me

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And you, Megantron

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because you're looking for trouble with me

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll kill you first

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Get ready, Megantron

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go, V!

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, Alpha!

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Get back!

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't!

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me face you

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Get back!

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Orphan!

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Nado!

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Get back!

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's wrong, Dad?

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Are you okay?

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm okay

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What's wrong?

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, we have to fight the dark lab, right?

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes, we want to help Alpha

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because the dark lab is really strong

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yo, the dark lab

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Is not a match for us

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We can be a match for them

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't be afraid

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But, I feel sorry for Alpha

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, you're right

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, you want to join us?

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, I'll join you

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, sis

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll join you too

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wait

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're alone in the dark lab

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Be careful

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I want to join you too

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to help Alpha

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to be a hero too

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, you want to join us?

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Go!

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sis!

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Alpha, it's better if you help Megantara

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So, I can face the dark lab

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, Prof

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But, be careful, Prof

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She's very strong

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Seperang!

[The Dark Lab]

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Prof, you're still wounded

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't attack her!

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Calm down

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I haven't lost yet

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Megantara!

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sis!

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wake up, Prof!

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Megantara, wake up!

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wake up, Prof!

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Wake up!

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How did I get here?

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Amazing!

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Professor Ada Barante has woken up

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank God!

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm so happy!

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Professor Ada Barante?

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Forget?

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Professor Ada Barante fainted

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He was attacked by the Dark Lab

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm very, very badly wounded

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Alpha!

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Where's Alpha?

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Alpha and Megantara are still in the Dark Lab, Prof

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Where are the teachers?

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
All teachers, go away, Prof!

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They want to help Alpha and Megantara

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're a villain!

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You've ruined Professor Ada's life!

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is the fate of those who oppose me

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you will have the same fate as them

[The Dark Lab]

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm going to kill you!

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No!

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why is Alpha so strong?

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He can turn my attack back on me

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What do you want, Alpha?

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Answer me, Alpha!

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You don't know?

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is the ring, Barga

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can throw it away

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't, Alpha

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Who knows it might be useful to you

143
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You better keep it

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go to Professor Barante's house

No

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Whoever wears this ring will be defeated

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I will wear it

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Just like Barga

151
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No, Alpha!

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Wake up

198
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank God

199
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Professor Agni

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You've been healed

201
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can heal because of your help

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you

203
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Alfa

204
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where is the Dark Lab?

205
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Tell me where it is

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've defeated it

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What?

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know where it's called

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're great, Alfa!

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's because of the army

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because I have a strong will

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I won't let the Dark Lab hurt my teachers

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you, Alfa

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
[The Dark Lab]

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We have to go in

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We have to help Alfa

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's go

218
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Alfa

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Alfa, you're safe!

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
One, two, three

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Three, two, two, three!

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That means you can't be a hero

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You can be a hero

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What hero?

225
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The Dark Lab

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Everyone, gather

227
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Announcement, announcement

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All students are required to go to class

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Now

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What's going on?

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is there another attack?

232
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm bored, you know?

233
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Men's war, men's war

234
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, we won't have a war this time

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We will welcome a new professor

236
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Who will teach at our school

237
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, a new professor

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
His name is Professor Tita

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He is a great man

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Very powerful

241
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's why Professor Aldebaran sent us to teach

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Who is it?

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's morning and they're already here

245
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They're disturbing Professor Tita and Danajel

246
00:17:43,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How could this happen?

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Please

248
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry

249
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Stop playing around

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's go back

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's my staff

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's go back

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The Dark Lab

254
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,100
the most subtle and biggest dance in the history of dance.

255
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:41,100
turns out my mantra is not perfect

256
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,100
if in front of the mirror my face hasn't changed

257
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,100
I'm afraid to look in the mirror

258
00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:00,100
come on, just open it, please

259
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,100
can

260
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,100
we can

261
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Hi Bro

262
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,100
how are you, Professor Lebaran

263
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,100
sorry professor, welcome

264
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,100
you mentioned Professor Salah earlier

265
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,100
he is called Professor Aldebar

266
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,100
[Laughter]

267
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,100
sorry, I thought it was a little wrong

268
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
I'm sorry

269
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,100
yes, I remember

270
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,100
it looks like your name is Mega

271
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Megaloman

272
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,100
right, right

273
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
wrong again

274
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,100
sorry, wrong, I'm sorry

275
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,100
I'm Begantan

276
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,100
yes yes

277
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,100
can I bring a pan?

278
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
please

279
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,100
there is a mosquito in your food

280
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
you are fat

281
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,100
but unfortunately you are also fat

282
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
[Laughter]

283
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
very accurate

284
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
very accurate, Professor Begantan

285
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
it's true

286
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,100
I can imagine how big the mosquito is

287
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
[Laughter]

288
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
Professor Titan, welcome to your school

289
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,100
welcome too, Professor Aldebaran

290
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:55,100
also introduce yourself, Professor

291
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,100
what's your name?

292
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm Agni

293
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Agni?

294
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
[Laughter]

295
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Professor Titan

296
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
you should come to my class

297
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
okay

298
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,100
so you can introduce yourself to the children

299
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
thank you

300
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
later, let Megantara bring the gift

301
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,100
thank you, Professor Aldebaran

302
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
let's go

303
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
yes

304
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,100
okay

305
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Megantara, do you need help?

306
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,100
no, I just have to be like this

307
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
I'm still strong, Sir

308
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
I'm old, Sir

309
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
good morning, children

310
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,100
good morning, Sir

311
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,100
today I will introduce you

312
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
a new teacher for you

313
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
his name is Professor Titan

314
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
please, Sir

315
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
good morning, children

316
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,100
good morning, Sir

317
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,100
I'm going to be a teacher

318
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,100
thank you, Professor

319
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
children

320
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
children, listen

321
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,100
I have another important announcement

322
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,100
our school will hold a magic tournament

323
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,100
which will compete for a very exclusive magic trophy

324
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
wow

325
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,100
that's fun

326
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
it must be fun

327
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
yes, it must be fun

328
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
I want to join

329
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
yes, I want to join too

330
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,100
I often participate in it

331
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
I will win

332
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
because I have trained

333
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
that's great

334
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
we have trained too

335
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:36,100
children, this tournament will only be attended by two children from Kunang and two children from Ketama

336
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
wow

337
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Sir, there are many of them

338
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
let's make it three, Sir

339
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
not just two, Sir

340
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
for the name of the participants

341
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Mr. Rayhan, the father of Tommy

342
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,100
who will bring the list of children who will participate in this competition

343
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:43,100
oh, this card is really six

344
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
really big

345
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
really heavy

346
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,100
really tired

347
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
really curious

348
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
really want to open it

349
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
rather than being curious

350
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
just open it

351
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,100
what is this card?

352
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,100
come on, just open it

353
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
please

354
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,100
please help me

355
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,100
this card is a token from Professor Adek Barat

356
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,100
what is my right to open it?

357
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm a good person

358
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,100
I can't be like this, I'll be punished

359
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
push it

360
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
this miracle merchant

361
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,100
will give the names of the children who will participate in this competition

362
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
and those children

363
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,100
are two names of children from Gerhana

364
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
and two names of children from Purnama

365
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I have to choose

366
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,100
start choosing

367
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,100
and the first name that comes out is

368
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
Alfa

369
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,100
now you will only be an audience

370
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
because you will not be chosen

371
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,100
so, I'm forced by Professor Adek Barat

372
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,100
to activate the miracle merchant

373
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
yes, Tommy

374
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
enter Tommy's name, Pi

375
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
don't put Alfa and Vega's names

376
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
just the charming ones, Pi

377
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
here, Pi, the people

378
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Tommy

379
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,100
yeah

380
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
the second name

381
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Jack

382
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
yeah

383
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
congratulations Jack

384
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
the third

385
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
Tole

386
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
yeah

387
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
congratulations Tole

388
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
thank you, Pi

389
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
yes

390
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
why is he so good?

391
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,100
because he's fat

392
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
must be wet if in the water

393
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
the last

394
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Wee

395
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
yeah

396
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
congratulations, Tole

397
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,100
yeah

398
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
congratulations, Tole

399
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,100
yeah

400
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
those are the four names of the participants

401
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
who will join the competition

402
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,100
calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down

403
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,100
apparently, this miracle merchant

404
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
wants one more name

405
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
to be five children

406
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
and the name that has been mentioned

407
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,100
cannot be changed

408
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
and don't you do it again

409
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
yeah Jack, I don't know

410
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,100
the last name

411
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Alfa

412
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
what is it?

413
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
what is this?

414
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
what is it?

415
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
one, two, three

416
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Zing, Duz, Jendel

417
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,100
my plan is to run away with the boss

418
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
we lied

419
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
we promised Tommy

420
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
we won't put Alfa's name

421
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
but why did you put Zing?

422
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Tommy

423
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,100
I don't understand either

424
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
why suddenly Alfa's name came out

425
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
what is it?

426
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
maybe

427
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
there is a mysterious person

428
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
who silently wants to enter Alfa's name

429
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
okay, just let it be

430
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,100
but we won't let Alfa

431
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
and Vega win

432
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Pi, please tell me

433
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,100
what is the first task

434
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Rey, Alfa

435
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,100
good luck

436
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
but

437
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
you have to be tough

438
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
to be the winner

439
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
okay

440
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
wait a minute

441
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,100
why are you so nervous?

442
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
huh?

443
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
why are you so quiet?

444
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
what's wrong?

445
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
I'm just confused

446
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
why I'm not chosen?

447
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
maybe

448
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
I'm stupid to think that way

449
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
beautiful, beautiful

450
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,100
you are so sensitive

451
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
already nervous

452
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
think you are stupid

453
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Vega

454
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
this kind of competition

455
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
is just normal

456
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
we often do it

457
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,100
so don't think too much

458
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
just relax

459
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
right?

460
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
yes, Vega

461
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm not stupid

462
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
all of you

463
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
all 100

464
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
none of you 0

465
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
yes

466
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
in class too

467
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
you always answer

468
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
when did you answer?

469
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
surely Vega first

470
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,100
[Laughter]

471
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
okay, sir

472
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
I support you

473
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
I'm sure

474
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
you can win

475
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
right

476
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,100
now

477
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
I will sing our cheer song

478
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
okay, ready?

479
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
ready

480
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
one

481
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,100
two

482
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
three

483
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,100
what the six wings

484
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
go to the

485
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,100
my plan works

486
00:33:44,100 --> 00:34:09,100
[Laughter]

487
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
you are a bad guy

488
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,100
your evil will be revealed

489
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,100
there is something that will know this

490
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
shut up

491
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
drink, drink

492
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,100
[Laughter]

493
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
you will be fooled

494
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
and don't you disturb all the girls

495
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
you are finished

496
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
get out

497
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,100
what is it?

498
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,100
good morning all

499
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,100
good morning, professor

500
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,100
now, professor wants to ask

501
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,100
who hasn't been to the brown rain part

502
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,100
raise your hand

503
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
me

504
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
so many

505
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
okay

506
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
brown rain

507
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,100
come on, take it all

508
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
don't let anyone miss it

509
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:48,100
if you're done, go back to your seats

510
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,100
dear, go back to your seats

511
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,100
all the children

512
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,100
there are still gifts for you

513
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
Lotto Riko

514
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
one more

515
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,100
let's go back to your seats

516
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
back

517
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
he wants to steal my child

518
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
my children

519
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
now we will learn

520
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,100
the government mantra

521
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,100
this government mantra is useful for someone

522
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,100
to order to do something

523
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
my children

524
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,100
this mantra is not easy

525
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,100
so that this mantra can succeed

526
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,100
people who say this mantra

527
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,100
must have a very strong attitude

528
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
do you understand, children?

529
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
understand?

530
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
yes, sir

531
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,100
the government stands on the stage

532
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,100
the government dances

533
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
enough

534
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
children

535
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,100
now you try one by one

536
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
come on

537
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
I'm already tired

538
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
hey

539
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
don't be late

540
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
continue, professor

541
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,100
the government is always winning

542
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
try it

543
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
be careful

544
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
wow, this is

545
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
next

546
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100
the government

547
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
please, sir

548
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,100
the government sleeps

549
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,100
[Applause]

550
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
the government

551
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
alpha

552
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
wow, it's already done

553
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
thank you, sir

554
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
if you can't, just don't

555
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,100
maybe you'll fall

556
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
don't be far away

557
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,100
the government jumps

558
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:28,100
[Applause]

559
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
good, sir

560
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
good

561
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
you're great, sir

562
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,100
thank you

563
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
okay

564
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
what do you want to be called?

565
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
Tom

566
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Tom, can you write?

567
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,100
this is a woman

568
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:08,100
[Laughter]

569
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,100
what?

570
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,100
I can't

571
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,100
the government

572
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,100
is defeated

573
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
the children's advertisement

574
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
the government has done

575
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
please, go out

576
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,100
rest

577
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
yes

578
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Alphon

579
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,100
I'm happy with you

580
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,100
you have a great talent

581
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
I'm a teacher

582
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,100
the most important thing is to be brave

583
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,100
yes

584
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,100
the professor also knows

585
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,100
this is one of your advantages

586
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,100
you're brave

587
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
[Laughter]

588
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,100
and one message from the professor

589
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,100
use the mantra

590
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
with good

591
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,100
in the competition tomorrow

592
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,100
the professor is sure

593
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,100
the mantra will be very useful

594
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
and the professor prays

595
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,100
you will win tomorrow

596
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
thank you, sir

597
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,100
you're welcome

598
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,100
children

599
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
when the sound of the flute is heard

600
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,100
the participants must dive to the bottom of the lake

601
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,100
when they arrive at the bottom of the lake

602
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,100
they must take a net

603
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,100
which has been guarded by a turtle

604
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
therefore, you, the participants

605
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
must defeat the turtle

606
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,100
and bring the net to the edge of the lake

607
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
as soon as possible

608
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,100
and now

609
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
in your hands

610
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,100
there is a box

611
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,100
in that box

612
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
there is a miniature of a turtle

613
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
which you will challenge

614
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,100
please open it

615
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,100
I got a turtle

616
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Ray, you're lucky

617
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,100
because the turtle with a turtle's hair

618
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
is the weakest

619
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,100
calm down, Ray

620
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,100
come on, cheer up

621
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,100
yes

622
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,100
I got a turtle with a turtle's hair

623
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
this is easy

624
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,100
I can definitely win

625
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,100
I got a turtle with a turtle's hair

626
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,100
I got a turtle with a turtle's eyes

627
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,100
I'm smart like Fika

628
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,100
and now

629
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
the first participant

630
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Nole

631
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,100
ready

632
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,100
children

633
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,100
it seems like the turtle failed to get the net

634
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,100
because of that

635
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
the turtle automatically fell

636
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,100
[Cheers]

637
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100
I'm so scared, Fika

638
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,100
I was attacked twice

639
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,100
actually I got the turtle

640
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
but I was attacked again

641
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,100
I'm scared, Fika

642
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,100
I hope it doesn't attack

643
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,100
don't be afraid, Ray

644
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
this is just a normal competition

645
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,100
if you want to win, it's okay

646
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
the important thing is you have the turtle

647
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
it's very useful for you

648
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,100
don't be afraid, Ray

649
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,100
keep fighting

650
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,100
keep going

651
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,100
thank you, Nole

652
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,100
thank you

653
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,100
and the next participant

654
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
the second one is

655
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,100
Ray

656
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,100
please, Ray

657
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,100
be careful

658
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
I'm sure I'll lose, Nole

659
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,100
I'll just go to the shore

660
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,100
just go to the shore

661
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,100
I'll go back to the sea

662
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
one, two

663
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,100
why isn't there a professor here?

664
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,100
Professor Titan

665
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,100
just take a break

666
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:22,100
yes, I succeeded

667
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,100
I got the turtle

668
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
you're great, Ray

669
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,100
you're very long, Ray

670
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,100
yes, because you're in the middle

671
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,100
right?

672
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,100
impossible

673
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,100
I, Ray

674
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,100
good, Ray

675
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,100
you succeeded

676
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
and your time

677
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,100
30 minutes

678
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,100
it means that you who haven't competed

679
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,100
must beat Ray's time

680
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,100
the next participant

681
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,100
Jack

682
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,100
one, two

683
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,100
go, Jack

684
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,100
[Applause]

685
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,100
he's so good

686
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,100
calm down, kids

687
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,100
it seems that Jack also failed to get the krang

688
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,100
it means that Jack also failed

689
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,100
what's wrong?

690
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:53,100
he's so strong

691
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,100
so I'm the winner

692
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:59,100
[Applause]

693
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,100
and the next participant

694
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,100
Tommy

695
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,100
you succeeded

696
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,100
be careful, Tommy

697
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,100
you're great, Tommy

698
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,100
one, two

699
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,100
yes, luckily, Papi told me that I'm a seaweed

700
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,100
making a fish

701
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,100
[Applause]

702
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,100
I'm the winner

703
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,100
good, Tommy

704
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,100
you succeeded

705
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,100
and your time

706
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,100
15 minutes

707
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,100
beat Ray's time

708
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,100
boss, boss

709
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,100
yes, boss

710
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,100
boss

711
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,100
15 minutes, Alfa

712
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,100
it's the highest record

713
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,100
you must be able to do it

714
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,100
Papi, you won't be able to do it

715
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,100
just give up

716
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,100
no, I won't give up

717
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,100
I've never tried

718
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
and now

719
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,100
our last contestant

720
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,100
Alfa, please

721
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,100
one, two

722
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,100
favorita

723
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,100
give it to me

724
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:19,100
[Applause]

725
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,100
very good, Alfa

726
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,100
your time is

727
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,100
14 minutes 30 seconds

728
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:35,100
[Applause]

729
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,100
so, the winner of this first contest is

730
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,100
Alfa

731
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,100
[Applause]

732
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,100
all of this is because of the women's mantra

733
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,100
the prayer

734
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,100
I thank God

735
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:08,100
the contestant

736
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,100
this is me, Alfa

737
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,100
why is there no sound?

738
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
Prof. Titan

739
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
this is me, Alfa

740
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:46,100
Prof. Titan

741
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,100
why is there no professor here?

742
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,100
Prof. Titan

743
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,100
I'm the one who's noisy

744
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,100
hey, Alfa

745
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,100
[Laughter]

746
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,100
what are you doing here?

747
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,100
you're talking like that

748
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,100
come on, laugh

749
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,100
come on

750
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,100
no, professor

751
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,100
I just want to say thank you to the professor

752
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,100
because of the advice of the professor

753
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,100
I won the first contest

754
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,100
you won, Alfa

755
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,100
[Laughter]

756
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,100
congratulations, Alfa

757
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,100
congratulations

758
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,100
I'm happy

759
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,100
[Laughter]

760
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,100
professor

761
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,100
why is this shaking?

762
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,100
[Laughter]

763
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,100
Alfa, you don't have to be afraid

764
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,100
what's in the closet

765
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,100
is just a baby centaur

766
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,100
[Laughter]

767
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,100
baby centaur?

768
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,100
yes

769
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,100
because baby centaur

770
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:13,100
can produce a very powerful poison

771
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,100
and Alfa, you don't have to be surprised

772
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,100
and don't be surprised

773
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,100
if you find weird creatures

774
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,100
in this room, Alfa

775
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,100
okay

776
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,100
then

777
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,100
I'll go to the toilet first

778
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,100
oh yes

779
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,100
be careful, Alfa

780
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,100
I lost again

781
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,100
I lost to Alfa again

782
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,100
I have to think

783
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,100
how can I beat Alfa

784
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,100
if necessary

785
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,100
she can't participate in the next contest

786
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,100
I know how

787
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:21,100
help

788
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,100
I'm asking for help

789
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,100
help

790
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,100
the sound is around here

791
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,100
but where?

792
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:36,100
help

793
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:51,100
maybe she's in the warehouse

794
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,100
hey

795
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,100
open the door

796
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:19,100
hey

797
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,100
open

798
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,100
yes

799
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,100
I'll open it later

800
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,100
but if the fight is over

801
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,100
open the door

802
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,100
oh my God

803
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,100
the fight has started

804
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,100
oh my God

805
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,100
Alfa

806
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,100
you have to succeed

807
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,100
but you have to trust us

808
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,100
yes, Alfa

809
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,100
you can't lose

810
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,100
yes, Alfa

811
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,100
if you lose, I'll replace you

812
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,100
Ray and Alfa don't know

813
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,100
what's the secret of the Angsa

814
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,100
if I already knew

815
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,100
I'll tell Papi

816
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,100
this time

817
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,100
I'll win

818
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,100
hahaha

819
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,100
isn't that Professor Titan?

820
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,100
why is he in front of the warehouse?

821
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,100
let's go

822
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,100
Professor Alhara

823
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,100
why are you here?
