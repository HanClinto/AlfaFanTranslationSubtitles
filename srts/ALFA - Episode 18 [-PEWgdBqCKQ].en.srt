 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

 Chase your dreams and hopes

 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

 Go, go, go, let's dream

 Go, go, go, we can do it

 Go, go, go, we can do it

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Yeah, I did it!

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Ankara, look at that

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 There's Alpha

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 It means that with us

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 You're really a Megatron

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 You better go

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Let Alpha go

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I won't let Alpha go

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Alpha!

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Attack her, Alpha

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Now!

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Team Ninja!

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Let's go, Nek

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Ready, Nek

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 One, two, three!

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Ankara was defeated

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Now it's just me

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Let's go

37

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 You won't get away with this

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 The door is locked

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 The door is locked

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 This must be a snake from the dark lab

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Calm down

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Open the door

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Try it, Alpha

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Okay

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Open the door!

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I can't get in

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Let's read the mantra together

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 It's not as easy as you think

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I won't let you leave this place

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 This is a virus!

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Now

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I'm getting stronger

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 You two

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Won't be able to take me

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And you, Megantron

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Because you're looking for trouble with me

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I'll kill you first

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Get ready, Megantron

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Let's go, V!

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 No, Alpha!

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Get back!

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Get back!

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Don't!

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Let me face you

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Get back!

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Orphan!

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Nado!

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Get back!

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 What's wrong, Dad?

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Are you okay?

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I'm okay

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 What's wrong?

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So, we have to fight the dark lab, right?

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Yes, we want to help Alpha

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Because the dark lab is really strong

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Yo, the dark lab

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Is not a match for us

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 We can be a match for them

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Don't be afraid

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 But, I feel sorry for Alpha

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Yes, you're right

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So, you want to join us?

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Yes

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Okay, I'll join you

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Let's go

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Okay, sis

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Wait

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I'll join you too

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Let's go

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Okay

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Wait

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 You're alone in the dark lab

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Be careful

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I want to join you too

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I want to help Alpha

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I want to be a hero too

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 So, you want to join us?

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Let's go

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Go!

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Sis!

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 I'm sorry

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Alpha, it's better if you help Megantara

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 So, I can face the dark lab

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Yes, Prof

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 But, be careful, Prof

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 She's very strong

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Seperang!

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Prof, you're still wounded

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Don't attack her!

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Calm down

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I haven't lost yet

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Megantara!

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Sis!

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Wake up, Prof!

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Wake up, Prof!

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Megantara, wake up!

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Wake up, Prof!

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Wake up!

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 How did I get here?

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Amazing!

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Professor Ada Barante has woken up

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Thank God!

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I'm so happy!

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Professor Ada Barante?

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Forget?

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Professor Ada Barante fainted

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 He was attacked by the Dark Lab

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I'm very, very badly wounded

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Alpha!

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Where's Alpha?

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Alpha and Megantara are still in the Dark Lab, Prof

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Where are the teachers?

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 All teachers, go away, Prof!

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 They want to help Alpha and Megantara

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 You're a villain!

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 You've ruined Professor Ada's life!

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 This is the fate of those who oppose me

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And you will have the same fate as them

 I'm going to kill you!

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 No!

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Why is Alpha so strong?

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 He can turn my attack back on me

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 What do you want, Alpha?

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Answer me, Alpha!

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I don't know

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You don't know?

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 This is the ring, Barga

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 You can throw it away

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Don't, Alpha

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Who knows it might be useful to you

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 You better keep it

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000

 No

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Whoever wears this ring will be defeated

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And I will wear it

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Just like Barga

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 No, Alpha!

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Don't!

 This is bad

 You're great, Alva!

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 That's because of the army

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Because I have a strong will

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I won't let the Dark Lab hurt my teachers

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000

00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,100
 but if the fight is over

999
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,100

1005
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,100
 you have to succeed

1006
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,100
 but you have to trust us

1007
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,100
 yes, Alva

1008
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,100
 you can't lose

 yes, Alva

 Ray and Alva don't know

1012
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,100
 what's the secret of the Angsa

1013
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,100
 if I already knew

1014
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,100
 I'll tell Papi

1015
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,100
 this time

01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,100

1019
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,100
