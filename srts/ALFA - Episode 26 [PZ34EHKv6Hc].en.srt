1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
From today, I'm the head of the school

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're so embarrassing

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You better tell me where is Professor Naldebaran

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me go, I'm being chased

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let me go, let me go, let me go

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tommy, do it quickly

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're a vixen

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Run, run, run

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Help me, Tommy

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Help me

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Help, I'm being chased, help

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't be a vixen

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Or do you want to suffer more?

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let Tommy go, quickly

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let him go

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's it, hold on

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hold on

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Help me, help me

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're a vixen

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Demet, what kind of man are you?

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Help me, help

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're a vixen

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're a man but you don't want to be loved

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And you, Tommy

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because you've been devoted to me

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You've got the highest grade in this school

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, yes, yes

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm a vixen

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wake up, Angka

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Angka, Angka, Angka, wake up

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're a vixen

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You've never loved anyone else

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Agni

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I didn't expect to see you here

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Finally we can meet

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Now is not the time to be in a hurry

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have to go to the bathroom

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't be a vixen

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We have to be careful because Angka has confessed to Professor Aldebaran

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You? Because of Aldebaran?

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And it's all thanks to the help of the Dark Lord

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So, from now on, everything will be easier

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My hair is black

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have an idea

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is it?

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But I'm asking you

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't tell Purwari

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He can't be trusted

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Panji, Panji

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You two have been together since school until now

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What's the enemy?

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Now everything is in the hands of Professor Gitan

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Give me a smile

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Professor Agni

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm in

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If it's about being naughty, being naughty, being naughty

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's my hobby

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You know it yourself, right?

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's good, Professor

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Come on, get ready

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This duricatus must be removed immediately

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If not, it's dangerous

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You can get a hangover for the rest of your life

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Come on, get ready

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hurry up

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Panji, Panji

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm bleeding

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It hurts, it hurts

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Not yet, Nik

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm bleeding

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Not yet, take a deep breath

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm bleeding

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Slowly, slowly

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They say the army of the West

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Just got hit by a duricatus and already screaming

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Shame on you

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Where is Gitan?

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We have to go to the village immediately

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Come on, prepare your lollipop

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Come on

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait, wait

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The lollipop is destroyed by that cactus

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We just take a break

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
While we think of finding a way out

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
To be able to go there

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Can, can

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's wrong?

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Get up, get up

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's wrong, soldier?

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What's wrong?

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So many duricatus

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was so happy just now

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because I got to be in Alfa's session

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're so good

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now everyone can see

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That I'm better than Alfa

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wait, wait

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Wait

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I want to see Alfa's session

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Who's the best

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry, I'm against you

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm so proud of you

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm proud of you

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm against you

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come on

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
She's just a little bit naughty

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
She's naughty

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I won

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm proud of you

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Tommy

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Follow me to the room

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, sir

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Alfa

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Alfa is better

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Tommy

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I have an important task for you now

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Starting today

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You will monitor every move of Alfa

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Starting from who she goes with

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Who she meets

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Or anything

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How about it?

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you ready?

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm ready, sir

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Good

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Very good, Tommy

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're better with me

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because if you're with Aldebaran

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can't be the number one student

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because he's too biased to Alfa

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But if you're biased to me

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can be the number one student in this magic school

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Alfa

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, finish

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You have to rest first

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When you're healthy

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You can come back to the dorm

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay, Alfa?

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you, Mrs. Pertiwi

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're welcome, handsome

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, I'm going now

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Bye-bye

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Alfa

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you okay now?

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, I'm just a bit dizzy

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We have to be more careful

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
With Tommy

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes, Alfa

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Just now

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Tommy was called by Professor Ankara

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He must be trying to say something bad

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Our school is going to be scary

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Not like before

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's so scary

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In a black jet

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I miss the Professor Libaran

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Now

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Where is Professor Libaran?

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Mr. Adi

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Alfa

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You just get well

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's okay, sir

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mr. Panji

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Please change to Blacky

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I really miss Blacky

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, sir

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I can't

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I change

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If I'm only in the first month

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a day off

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Mr. Panji

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Now we're all confused

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
How

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How to face Professor Ankara

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He threatened us

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He's going to hurt Professor Libaran

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If we don't fight back

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes, sir

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
For that matter

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You just calm down

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I already have a plan

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
How?

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What is it?

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's safe

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's time for us to take action

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Ready

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
One, two, three

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Three

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Go

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll be caught

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll take Jubba first

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Jubba

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is Jubba

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay, let's go

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I want to talk

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Tomorrow I'll teach the black magic to the children

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I think

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I hear a voice

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Go

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why are you in jail?

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a long story

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm here

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
To protect my grandson

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
His name is Leon

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What's wrong with your grandson?

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Leon

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Has the ability

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
To control fire

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because of that

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The Dark Lord

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Was after him

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Had to hide

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We moved

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
From one place to another

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Finally, the Dark Lord

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Was able to find us

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And save us

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
From the Dark Lord

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm scared

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:30,000
(The Dark Lord is here)

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't ask me

242
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why I'm here

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm here to ask you

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you want to fight me

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You will have to fight me

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Will show you

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:38,000
(The Dark Lord is here)

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Impossible

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Angkar

251
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Calm down, Angkar

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Even if you're here

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can still defeat you

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm here

256
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
(The Dark Lord is here)

257
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Zell

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think I'm too tired now

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's better to find fresh air first

260
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm scared

261
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't be like that, Zell

262
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm ready

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's go

264
00:16:42,000 --> 00:17:36,000
(The Dark Lord is here)

265
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I challenge you, Angkar

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're crazy

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
How dare you challenge me

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll show you your true self now

269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Panji

270
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're dead but you're still pathetic

271
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You can still disturb people

272
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Show me your true self now, Panji

273
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hurry

274
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Weird

275
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This is really weird and it doesn't make sense

276
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Even though I'm dead

277
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I can still disturb people

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But I don't care

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Whether it's a person or a ghost

280
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm still invincible

281
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Let's go

282
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What's that?

283
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Panji

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Get out, Panji

285
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll destroy this room

286
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's that?

287
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm so mad

288
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Calm down, Angkar

289
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's better if I walk straight ahead

290
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I want to drink hot chocolate

291
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
After that, I'll feel better

292
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's go back there

293
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But Prof. Titan is still not here

294
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We have to find a time until Prof. Titan finishes his assignment

295
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But what should we do?

296
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Let's just follow him

297
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yes

298
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Give me a smile

299
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's safe

300
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The situation is under control

301
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Eight, six

302
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I can imagine

303
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If Angkara sees this

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He'll be terrified

305
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He'll scream

306
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
One by one

307
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Angkara is here

308
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
[Angkara]

309
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Tentara

310
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
How's it going?

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Is it still a long way to go?

312
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes, Tentara

313
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If we use lollipop

314
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It won't take a day

315
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We've arrived at Melayu Village

316
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But if we walk

317
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It'll take two more days

318
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Two days?

319
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
How long?

320
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Two days

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
More than two weeks

322
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Two weeks is too long, Tentara

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Even so, if we walk

324
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It won't take two weeks to stop

325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Not to rest

326
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Not to eat

327
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Not to go to the toilet

328
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It'll take two weeks to walk

329
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Tentara, this joke is not funny

330
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Tentara

331
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Enough

332
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Don't make it harder

333
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
How about we call lollipop from school?

334
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wait, I'll try

335
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Davatang

336
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It can't be

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The magic mantra Davatang

338
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We can use it

339
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If the distance from school is only 10 km

340
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
While our distance from school is thousands of km

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So the magic mantra Davatang won't work here

342
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now it's time for us to eat

343
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Take out your lollipop

344
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And share the rest with me

345
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's go

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We're almost out of food, Tentara

347
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's right, Tentara

348
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Where is it?

349
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
How about we try first?

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Wait

351
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Davatang

352
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Food

353
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Why is there sand?

354
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There's a lot of sand

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is a sand field

356
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Not a house for eating

357
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There's no food

358
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No lollipop

359
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
No water

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What should we do, Tentara?

361
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We might die of hunger here

362
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This is it

363
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What's up, Tentara?

364
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We have an idea

365
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
My favorite bicycle

366
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Bicycle?

367
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We can eat a bicycle

368
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're kidding

369
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Hey

370
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
My bicycle

371
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't underestimate it

372
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's not just a bicycle

373
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It can bring lollipop here

374
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And food

375
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And drink

376
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We still have a chance

377
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Hurry up, Tentara

378
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's not easy to call it

379
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's a bit difficult

380
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This is how you call it

381
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Test, test, test

382
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
One, two, three, test

383
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Ontel

384
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Tell Alfa

385
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Alfa, please prepare

386
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Five lollipops

387
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Food and drink

388
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Send it to the sand hill

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We're all waiting there

390
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Hurry up

391
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Don't take too long

392
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay

393
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Thank you, Ontel

394
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What do you think, Tentara?

395
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's more peaceful here

396
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There won't be any problem

397
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:37,000
[music]

398
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Hey, what are you doing?

399
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Ancik

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Get out

401
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Where are you going?

402
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I want you to send it to the sand hill

403
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's close

404
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's done

405
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll destroy your bike

406
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Ready

407
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Go

408
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You're kidding me

409
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Go

410
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
How can a military bike follow a forest?

411
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's a forest

412
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Does it know our plan?

413
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Maybe it heard us

414
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Maybe it didn't hear us

415
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
After that, we'll go to the sand hill

416
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And it'll follow us

417
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Our bike is out of the sand hill

418
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We'll be in trouble

419
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
If we get hit, we'll get out of the forest

420
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We'll get hit by the sand hill

421
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
What should we do?

422
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
There's one solution

423
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What is it?

424
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We run

425
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Run

426
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Inspiration

427
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Look

428
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Starting tomorrow, I'll make a rule

429
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The bike that's in the school must be removed

430
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It seems like the other 300 are gone

431
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm sure it's afraid of my threat

432
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But if it's really you

433
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Why did it follow me?

434
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Or

435
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Is it still alive?

436
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We're here

437
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, professor?

438
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I want to ask you

439
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You have to answer honestly

440
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If not, I'll punish you

441
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll answer honestly, professor

442
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Answer

443
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Is it true that I'm still alive?

444
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Or is it really dead?

445
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Answer

446
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Is it true that I'm still alive?

447
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Answer

448
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Is it true that I'm still alive?

449
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Professor is evil

450
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Why did you ask that?

451
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You want to make me sad again?

452
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You're all dust now

453
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Professor is evil

454
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So it's really dead

455
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So it was really a ghost

456
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
People are right

457
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If a person is evil, it means he's evil

458
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But still

459
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Even if he's not dead, he's still a ghost

460
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Professor is evil

461
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Shut up

462
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:30,000
To be continued

463
00:30:30,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We can do this

464
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Let's go to the restaurant

465
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Let's go

466
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Professor is chasing us

467
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We have to go

468
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Why don't we just go with him?

469
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We can do it

470
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm tired of running

471
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm tired of being chased

472
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm scared

473
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Let's just play

474
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Sit, rest, sleep

475
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We can play like friends

476
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Like friends?

477
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm scared

478
00:32:39,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Who threw trash in my room?

479
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You're too much

480
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Today, I will finish you

481
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Get ready

482
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't come in, I'm not sleepy

483
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Get in

484
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'll go this way

485
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Get in

486
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Be careful, Gara

487
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's been a decade

488
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It turns out that the science of the universe is not the same as the one in the world

489
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Come here, Gara

490
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Finish him, Gara

491
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You're such a bad guy

492
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Until when?

493
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The number can't beat him

494
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And if it can, he will disappear

495
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And make the number feel

496
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:04,000
What are you doing here?

497
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Professor, hurry up

498
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
We're doing nothing

499
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Excuse me, Professor Purwa

500
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm preparing the rehearsal for tomorrow

501
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You're smiling

502
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Professor Purwa

503
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I also have to prepare the rehearsal for tomorrow

504
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Me too, Professor

505
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Wait

506
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You're not teaching

507
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What are you preparing?

508
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I mean, I'm preparing the medicine

509
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Who knows, someone got hurt after fighting inside

510
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Someone got hurt?

511
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What's this?

512
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Adi

513
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What are you doing here?

514
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Answer me!

515
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
[The number can't beat him]

516
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What's that?

517
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Jip Jip Jip Jip Jip Jip

518
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
There's another guy

519
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
[The number can't beat him]

520
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The girl is scared

521
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
[The number can't beat him]

522
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I got it

523
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
[The number can't beat him]

524
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's just a ball monster

525
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I thought it was a flood

526
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Angkara

527
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It turns out that you're afraid of me

528
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's really sad

529
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm more afraid of you than of a girl

530
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm going to school

531
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Shut up!

532
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
[The number can't beat him]

533
00:37:48,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Where are you?

534
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's raining

535
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Where are you?

536
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
[The number can't beat him]

537
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Help!

538
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
[The number can't beat him]

539
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What are you?

540
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You told me to go up there?

541
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
What are you doing?

542
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm going to jump like this

543
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Help!

544
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
[The number can't beat him]

545
00:39:42,000 --> 00:40:06,000
[We can do it]

546
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What are you doing?

547
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
If you see this door, I'll be mad

548
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So, I want to pay you back

549
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I know

550
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So, you want me to open this door?

551
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Okay, jump

552
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I told you

553
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
[The number can't beat him]

554
00:40:37,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Bicycle?

555
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What do you want?

556
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
[The number can't beat him]

557
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
This bicycle is so weird

558
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Maybe the army asked this bicycle to do something

559
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Like that

560
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What are you looking for?

561
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
[The number can't beat him]

562
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So, you're looking for lollipop?

563
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
This is so weird

564
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
We already have our own lollipop

565
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
How many do you want?

566
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
One?

567
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Why are you sleeping?

568
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Why?

569
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You want more?

570
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Tell me

571
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
This much?

572
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Four is enough?

573
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Five?

574
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This bicycle is so weird

575
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
[The number can't beat him]

576
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Wait!

577
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So, you want food too?

578
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You've been gone for a while

579
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:24,000
[The number can't beat him]

580
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Be careful

581
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'll send you my greetings

582
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Tell the army, Nick and the others

583
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Tell them

584
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
They have to go home safely

585
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Bye, bicycle!

586
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
[The number can't beat him]

587
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Where are you? I can find you

588
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I've run so far

589
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
He can't catch me

590
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I've told you so many times

591
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Wherever you go

592
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I can find you

593
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So, you better not reject me

594
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You're my student

595
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So, you'll be a great sniper

596
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
A strong sniper

597
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And you'll have a lot of followers

598
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
[The number can't beat him]

599
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The army is coming

600
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm scared

601
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:29,000
The army is coming

602
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm scared too

603
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You all have to be patient

604
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Be patient

605
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Wait

606
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I heard a poem

607
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Eat in front of the soldiers

608
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
If we're hungry

609
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
We better drink first

610
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh, no

611
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
What about the army?

612
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
We've run out of drinks

613
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yes, the army

614
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm so thirsty

615
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm thirsty

616
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
There's no army in the desert

617
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
There's no army drink

618
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Wait

619
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I just remembered

620
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We can chant the water of the phoenix

621
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Which was taught by Prof. Titan

622
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You still remember, right?

623
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So, we're still close

624
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That's it

625
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What if I try?

626
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
What?

627
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The water of the phoenix

628
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The water of the phoenix is useless here

629
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's broken

630
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, no

631
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Hey, listen

632
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We're in the desert

633
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Even though the water of the phoenix is powerful

634
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But the water of the phoenix can't create water

635
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The water of the phoenix can only move water

636
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
From the water source around us

637
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
If the water of the phoenix doesn't work

638
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It means there's no water source around here

639
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm so thirsty

640
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
What?

641
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's really cool

642
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Where's the water?

643
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I can't see it

644
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What's wrong?

645
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
The army is taking one of the 12 soul stones

646
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
One of the soul stones?

647
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
What's a soul stone, Prof?

648
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's a part of the black magic

649
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Black magic?

650
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
In the past

651
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
There was a sorcerer named Sergius

652
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Sergius?

653
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,900
Dive in and around the chicken.

654
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:28,900
All you need to do is concentrate on the chicken.

655
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:58,000
[music]

656
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
He's not a normal human.

657
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And his power is very sadistic.

658
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Let's get out of here.

659
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Is that all you got?

660
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
In the old times,

661
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
there was a evil sorcerer named Cerberus.

662
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It turned out that Cerberus used a soul stone to protect his power.

663
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And he divided his soul into 12 parts.

664
00:49:29,000 --> 00:50:15,000
[music]

665
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That's why he can't be defeated.

666
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And every time someone tries to kill him,

667
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
his soul will be revived.

668
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And that will bring him back to life.

669
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
The evil of Cerberus kept happening.

670
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That's what made all the good sorcerers unite to try to defeat him.

671
00:50:39,000 --> 00:52:12,000
[music]

672
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And after the 12 soul stones were destroyed,

673
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Cerberus was defeated.

674
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
[music]

675
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
There are two sets of soul stones in this world.

676
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
One of them was used by Cerberus.

677
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The other was kept by Professor Aldebaran.

678
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But without anyone's knowledge,

679
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
the Dark Lord managed to take the soul stone from Professor Aldebaran.

680
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And he used the soul stone to protect his power.

681
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Are you ready for me to enter the magical world to be the chosen one?

682
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:20,000
[music]

683
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
What's wrong, Yaya? Are you afraid of him?

684
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
No, I'm not willing to work with you.

685
00:53:25,000 --> 00:54:02,000
[music]

686
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Leon, all decisions are in your hands.

687
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So you have to think carefully.

688
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
If you refuse me,

689
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
it's the same.

690
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You will be separated from your family forever.

691
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:32,000
[music]

692
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Leon, no.

693
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Please don't.

694
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Don't, Leon.

695
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Maybe you've never heard of my prison.

696
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So, there's nothing wrong with it.

697
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm just a little afraid of you.

698
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
The fire prison is a prison surrounded by many people.

699
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And the guards are very cruel.

700
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
If we make a little mistake,

701
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
we will be stabbed with a sharp sword.

702
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Try to imagine that.

703
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Think about it.

704
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
[music]

705
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Wait.

706
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
[music]

707
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
[laughing]

708
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Good, good.

709
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
[laughing]

710
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
[music]

711
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
No.

712
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Don't.

713
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Please don't.

714
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Don't, Leon.

715
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
[music]

716
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Sir.

717
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
[music]

718
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
What's wrong, sir?

719
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
My grandson...

720
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
has become...

721
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
a dark man.

722
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
[music]

723
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
If so,

724
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
we have to find a way out of here.

725
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Leon.

726
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Welcome to the palace.

727
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Dafatang Juba.

728
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Leon.

729
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Now, you use it.

730
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Why?

731
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
This juba indicates how deep your knowledge is.

732
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
If this juba turns black,

733
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
then,

734
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
your knowledge will be deeper.

735
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Let's eat.

736
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Dafatang, food.

737
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
[laughing]

738
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You can finish it all.

739
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Come on.

740
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
[music]

741
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
There's one thing you don't know, Leon.

742
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
That juba is the mirror of your heart.

743
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Juba budi.

744
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It means your heart is still clean.

745
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
The darker the juba is,

746
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
the darker and evil your heart is.

747
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
When the juba changes color to red,

748
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
that's when your heart changes to black and evil.

749
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And at that time,

750
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
you're ready for me to enter the magic room

751
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
to be the chosen one.

752
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
[laughing]

753
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So, where is the King of the Wild now?

754
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
We don't know yet.

755
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
We've tried to force Professor Angkara to tell us where Professor Aldebaran is.

756
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But until now,

757
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
he's still keeping it a secret.

758
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Wow.

759
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So, Professor Angkara deliberately kept it a secret from us?

760
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yes, Alfa.

761
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
But don't worry.

762
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
We're still trying to investigate him and find out where Professor Aldebaran is.

763
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Hmm.

764
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I have a better idea.

765
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
What is it, Alfa?

766
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Just leave it to us.

767
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's morning already.

768
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Hey, wake up. It's morning.

769
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Acting like an intel agent.

770
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Eating two jellies at a time.

771
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Where is that jelly?

772
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Why isn't it here yet?

773
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Oh, no. This is dangerous.

774
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I have to call him again.

775
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Why is he calling me?

776
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Maybe he's not connected.

777
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Test, test, one, two, three.

778
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Test, test.

779
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Check, check. Test, one, two, three.

780
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Ontel?

781
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Do you hear me?

782
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Roger?

783
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
What's in the coffee, Ontel?

784
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh, no.

785
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I hope he doesn't wake up.

786
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
What should I do?

787
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I can't even crawl.

788
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I don't know why I'm in this situation.

789
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It's not a jelly.

790
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Hey, wake up.

791
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It's morning already.

792
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Intara, where are you?

793
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Did you get the jellies?

794
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
There are fruits,

795
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
feeding the animals,

796
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
the stroller,

797
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
the blanket,

798
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
the fire,

799
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
the children,

800
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
and Ontel hasn't come yet.

801
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Intara, we could die of hunger here.

802
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Yes, Intara.

803
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Intara, I'll join you.

804
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm so weak, Intara.

805
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
What should I do?

806
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Me too, Intara.

807
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Kids, today we're going to learn...

808
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
how to turn ordinary water...

809
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
into grape juice.

810
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Now, pay attention...

811
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and listen to the mantra.

812
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Javadi.

813
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Good morning.

814
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I'm the one who will lead you to teach.

815
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Angkara.

816
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I mean, Professor Angkara.

817
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Please don't disturb my lesson, Professor.

818
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You're so rude, Agni.

819
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
How dare you forbid me?

820
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Have you forgotten who I am?

821
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm the head of the school here.

822
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Professor Angkara.

823
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Agni, I didn't forbid you.

824
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Get out of my way.

825
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Now, kids.

826
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Whoever succeeds in following my instructions...

827
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
will get a prize.

828
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Come on.

829
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Who wants to go first?

830
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I want to talk.

831
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Oh, it's you, Tommy.

832
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
The smart kid.

833
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Come on.

834
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Go ahead, Tommy.

835
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Go ahead.

836
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Tommy.

837
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Now, follow my mantra.

838
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Javadi Rajo.

839
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Javadi Rajo?

840
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Did I succeed, Professor?

841
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Where's the prize?

842
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Not yet, Tommy.

843
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Because I have to prove it first.

844
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Is this water...

845
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
really poisoned?

846
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
How?

847
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
The way is...

848
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
one of your classmates...

849
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
must drink this water.

850
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Angkara. / Agni.

851
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Please don't hurt my son.

852
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
If you disturb me again,

853
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I'll have another lesson from you.

854
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
(The mantra is very powerful.)

855
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
(Whoever gets affected by this mantra...)

856
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
(will die.)

857
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:41,000
(We can do it.)

858
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Come on.

859
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Who wants to taste this water?

860
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Please be my opponent.

861
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Come on, kids.

862
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Go ahead.

863
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Professor, I'm an opponent.

864
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So, you're Vega.

865
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It seems like you're suitable to be my opponent.

866
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Please go ahead.

867
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Vega, go ahead.

868
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Or I'll give you a punishment.

869
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Professor Angkara, please.

870
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Don't hurt my kids. / Hurry.

871
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Vega, go ahead.

872
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Don't, Vega.

873
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Don't.

874
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Vega.

875
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Professor Angkara, don't hurt my kids.

876
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Quiet.

877
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Vega.

878
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
(The mantra is very powerful.)

879
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
(Whoever gets affected by this mantra...)

880
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
(will die.)

881
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Guys.

882
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Give them this water.

883
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yes, Professor.

884
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
If they're separated,

885
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
you'll get a reward.

886
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yes.

887
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Yes, Professor.

888
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Drink it.

889
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Hurry.

890
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yes, Vega.

891
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Drink it.

892
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So, I'll get the reward.

893
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Hurry.

894
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Drink it.

895
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Vega.

896
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Drink it, Vega.

897
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
(The mantra is very powerful.)

898
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
(Whoever gets affected by this mantra...)

899
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
(will die.)

900
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:42,000
You're not funny.

901
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Follow me.

902
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Professor Angkara, wait.

903
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Professor.

904
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Vega.

905
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Stand here and raise one of your legs.

906
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Hurry.

907
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Today,

908
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I'll punish you.

909
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Stand here and raise one of your legs until the afternoon.

910
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You're not allowed to eat or drink.

911
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
How long will you run away from here?

912
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Vega, wait.

913
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Oh, my goodness.

914
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It's so big, Vega.

915
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Let's help Vega.

916
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Let's go.

917
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Don't you dare to help him.

918
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
If you dare to help him,

919
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
you'll be punished severely.

920
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Guys, don't worry.

921
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I'll teach him well.

922
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Agni.

923
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Teach him again.

924
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
-I'm sorry, Vega. -This is an order.

925
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
(The mantra is very powerful.)

926
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Agni.

927
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Hey, wait.

928
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Let's go.

929
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Guys.

930
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
You're hungry, right?

931
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
How about we try to find food,

932
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
drink, or anything...

933
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
so we won't die here?

934
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Where are we going, Nick?

935
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
My body is so weak. I can't walk.

936
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes, Nick.

937
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
At least, we try.

938
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
At least, we won't starve.

939
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
If we starve, we'll try.

940
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I remember I read a book.

941
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
In the forest,

942
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
sometimes, there's a spring called...

943
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
oasis.

944
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It means we still have hope.

945
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Do you want to join us?

946
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
No.

947
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
-No. -No.

948
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I can't stand it anymore, Nick.

949
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
-I'm so tired. -Alright, Nick.

950
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I'll join you.

951
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Instead of starving to death here.

952
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I won't join you.

953
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I can't stand it.

954
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'll try to find food.

955
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Hey.

956
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Wait.

957
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
You're just a kid.

958
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Where are you going?

959
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
We're looking for water, soldier.

960
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Yes, soldier.

961
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Anything. Hamptons can eat.

962
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
No.

963
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Don't.

964
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Come here.

965
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Go back.

966
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
This is a desert, bro.

967
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Don't play in the desert.

968
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
It's dangerous.

969
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
There are many wild animals.

970
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Many weird animals.

971
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
If you're eaten, it'll be a disaster.

972
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Come here. Go back.

973
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Be patient.

974
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Soon, my bike...

975
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
will come here.

976
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Bike again.

977
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Dream.

978
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
How long do we have to wait?

979
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Since yesterday, there's no bike, soldier.

980
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Do you want us to starve to death here?

981
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Soldier.

982
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
If you don't want to go,

983
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
if you don't want us to starve,

984
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
we have to fight to find food and drink.

985
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Yes, soldier.

986
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
We don't want to die here.

987
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
We'd better die when we're looking for water...

988
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
than die here.

989
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
That's right.

990
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Okay, let's go.

991
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I'm with them.

992
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But what about them?

993
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I'm worried.

994
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:28,000
A rat.

995
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
There.

996
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So, you've met your trial rat.

997
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Trial rat?

998
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
What do you mean, sir?

999
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
This rat...

1000
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
will help you learn mantra.

1001
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Because I'll teach you...

1002
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
a lot of mantras.

1003
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Mantra?

1004
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:02,000
What mantra, sir?

1005
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Look.

1006
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:19,000
This mantra is very powerful.

1007
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
It will make you scream.

1008
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Just like that rat.

1009
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Stop.

1010
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Now, do what I've done.

1011
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
That rat's mantra.

1012
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Before this bell rings.

1013
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
(The trial rat)

1014
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Sir, I have to torture this rat.

1015
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
No. I don't want this rat to get hurt.

1016
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
If you refuse, your brother will suffer.

1017
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And if you obey all his orders,

1018
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
your brother will get happiness.

1019
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
He will get food in prison.

1020
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
All decisions are up to you.

1021
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Listen.

1022
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
If you refuse,

1023
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
your brother will be stabbed by a knife.

1024
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Guys.

1025
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
We have to run.

1026
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Why?

1027
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Why, Feca?

1028
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
There's a rat.

1029
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm here because I want to quit.

1030
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Lies.

1031
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You're lying.

1032
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You're definitely lying.

1033
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Are you sure...

1034
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
you want to quit being a teacher here?

1035
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
