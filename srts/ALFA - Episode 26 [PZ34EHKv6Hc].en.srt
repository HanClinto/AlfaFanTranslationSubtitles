 To be continued...

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000

 To be continued...

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 From today, I'm the head of the school

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You're so embarrassing

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 You better tell me where is Professor Naldebaran

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Let me go, I'm being chased

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Let me go, let me go, let me go

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Tommy, do it quickly

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 You're a vixen

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Run, run, run

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Help me, Tommy

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Help me

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Help, I'm being chased, help

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Don't be a vixen

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Or do you want to suffer more?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Let Tommy go, quickly

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Let him go

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 That's it, hold on

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Hold on

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Help me, help me

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Help me, help me

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Help me, help me

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 You're a vixen

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Demet, what kind of man are you?

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Help me, help

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 You're a vixen

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 You're a man but you don't want to be loved

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And you, Tommy

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Because you've been devoted to me

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 You've got the highest grade in this school

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Yes, yes, yes

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I'm a vixen

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Wake up, Angka

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Angka, Angka, Angka, wake up

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You're a vixen

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 You've never loved anyone else

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Agni

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I didn't expect to see you here

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Finally we can meet

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Now is not the time to be in a hurry

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I have to go to the bathroom

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Don't be a vixen

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 We have to be careful because Angka has confessed to Professor Aldebaran

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 You? Because of Aldebaran?

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Yes

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And it's all thanks to the help of the Dark Lord

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So, from now on, everything will be easier

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 My hair is black

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I have an idea

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 What is it?

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But I'm asking you

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Don't tell Purwari

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 He can't be trusted

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Panji, Panji

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 You two have been together since school until now

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 What's the enemy?

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Now everything is in the hands of Professor Gitan

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Give me a smile

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Professor Agni

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 I'm in

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 If it's about being naughty, being naughty, being naughty

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 That's my hobby

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 You know it yourself, right?

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 That's good, Professor

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Come on, get ready

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 This duricatus must be removed immediately

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 If not, it's dangerous

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 You can get a hangover for the rest of your life

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Come on, get ready

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Hurry up

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Panji, Panji

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I'm bleeding

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It hurts, it hurts

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Not yet, Nik

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I'm bleeding

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Not yet, take a deep breath

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I'm bleeding

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Slowly, slowly

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They say the army of the West

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Just got hit by a duricatus and already screaming

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Shame on you

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Where is Gitan?

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 We have to go to the village immediately

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Come on, prepare your lollipop

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Come on

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Wait, wait

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 The lollipop is destroyed by that cactus

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 We just take a break

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 While we think of finding a way out

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 To be able to go there

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Can, can

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What's wrong?

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Get up, get up

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 What's wrong, soldier?

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 What's wrong?

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 So many duricatus

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So many duricatus

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I was so happy just now

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Because I got to be in Alva's session

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 You're so good

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Now everyone can see

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 That I'm better than Alva

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Wait, wait

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Wait

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I want to see Alva's session

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Who's the best

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I'm sorry, I'm against you

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I'm so proud of you

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I'm proud of you

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I'm sorry, I'm against you

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Come on

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 She's just a little bit naughty

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 She's naughty

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I won

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I'm proud of you

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I'm proud of you

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I'm proud of you

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I'm proud of you

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Tommy

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Follow me to the room

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Okay, sir

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Alva

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Alva

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Alva is better

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Tommy

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I have an important task for you now

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Starting today

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 You will monitor every move of Alva

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Starting from who she goes with

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Who she meets

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Or anything

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 How about it?

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Are you ready?

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'm ready, sir

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Good

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Very good, Tommy

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 You're better with me

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Because if you're with Aldebaran

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 You can't be the number one student

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Because he's too biased to Alva

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But if you're biased to me

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 You can be the number one student in this magic school

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Alva

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Alva

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Alva

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Alva

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Alva

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Alva

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Alva

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Alva

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Alva

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Alva

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Alva

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Alva

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Alva

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Okay, finish

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 You have to rest first

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 When you're healthy

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 You can come back to the dorm

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Okay, Alva?

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Thank you, Mrs. Pertiwi

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 You're welcome, handsome

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Okay, I'm going now

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Bye-bye

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Alva

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Are you okay now?

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 No, I'm just a bit dizzy

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 We have to be more careful

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 With Tommy

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Yes, Alva

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Just now

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Tommy was called by Professor Ankara

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 He must be trying to say something bad

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Yes

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Our school is going to be scary

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Not like before

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Yes

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 It's so scary

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 In a black jet

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Yes

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I miss the Professor Libaran

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Now

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Where is Professor Libaran?

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Mr. Adi

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Mr. Adi

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Alva

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 You just get well

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It's okay, sir

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Mr. Panji

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Please change to Blacky

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I really miss Blacky

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Yes, sir

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I can't

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I change

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 If I'm only in the first month

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 It's a day off

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Mr. Panji

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Now we're all confused

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 How

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 How to face Professor Ankara

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Because

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 He threatened us

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 He's going to hurt Professor Libaran

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 If we don't fight back

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Yes, sir

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 For that matter

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 You just calm down

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I already have a plan

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 How?

224
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 What is it?

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 What is it?

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Okay

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Okay

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Okay

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It's safe

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Now

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It's time for us to take action

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Ready

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 One, two, three

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Three

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Go

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I'll be caught

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Okay

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I'll take Jubba first

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Jubba

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 This is Jubba

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Okay, let's go

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I want to talk

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Tomorrow I'll teach the black magic to the children

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I think

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I hear a voice

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Go

247
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Why are you in jail?

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 It's a long story

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I'm here

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 To protect my grandson

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 His name is Leon

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 What's wrong with your grandson?

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Leon

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Has the ability

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 To control fire

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Because of that

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 The Dark Lord

258
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Was after him

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 We

260
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Had to hide

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 We moved

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 From one place to another

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 But

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Finally, the Dark Lord

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Was able to find us

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And save us

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 From the Dark Lord

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 I'm scared

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I'm scared

270
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I'm scared

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Don't ask me

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Why I'm here

277
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I'm here to ask you

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 If you want to fight me

279
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 You will have to fight me

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 I

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Will show you

282
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

285
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

286
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

288
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

289
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Impossible

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Angkar

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Calm down, Angkar

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Even if you're here

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I can still defeat you

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Yes

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I'm here

300
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 I'm here

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 I'm here

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I'm here

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Zell

305
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I think I'm too tired now

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 It's better to find fresh air first

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I'm scared

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'm scared

309
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Don't be like that, Zell

310
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I'm ready

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Let's go

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

315
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

317
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

320
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 (The Dark Lord is here)

321
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I challenge you, Angkar

322
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 You're crazy

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 How dare you challenge me

324
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I'll show you your true self now

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I'll show you your true self now

326
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I'll show you your true self now

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Panji

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 You're dead but you're still pathetic

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 You can still disturb people

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Show me your true self now, Panji

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Hurry

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Weird

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 This is really weird and it doesn't make sense

334
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Even though I'm dead

335
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I can still disturb people

336
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 But I don't care

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Whether it's a person or a ghost

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 I'm still invincible

339
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Let's go

340
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 What's that?

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 What's that?

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 What's that?

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 What's that?

344
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 What's that?

345
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 What's that?

346
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 What's that?

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Panji

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Get out, Panji

349
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I'll destroy this room

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 What's that?

351
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I'm so mad

352
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Calm down, Angkar

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 It's better if I walk straight ahead

354
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I want to drink hot chocolate

355
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 After that, I'll feel better

356
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Let's go back there

357
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 But Prof. Titan is still not here

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 We have to find a time until Prof. Titan finishes his assignment

359
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 But what should we do?

360
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Let's just follow him

361
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Yes

362
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Give me a smile

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 It's safe

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The situation is under control

365
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Eight, six

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I can imagine

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 If Angkara sees this

368
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 He'll be terrified

369
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 He'll scream

370
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 One by one

371
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Angkara is here

372
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 [Angkara]

373
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Tentara

374
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 How's it going?

375
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Is it still a long way to go?

376
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Yes, Tentara

377
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 If we use lollipop

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It won't take a day

379
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 We've arrived at Melayu Village

380
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 But if we walk

381
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It'll take two more days

382
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Two days?

383
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 How long?

384
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Two days

385
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 More than two weeks

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Two weeks is too long, Tentara

387
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Even so, if we walk

388
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 It won't take two weeks to stop

389
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Not to rest

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Not to eat

391
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Not to go to the toilet

392
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 It'll take two weeks to walk

393
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Tentara, this joke is not funny

394
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Tentara

395
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Enough

396
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Don't make it harder

397
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 How about we call lollipop from school?

398
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Wait, I'll try

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Davatang

400
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 It can't be

401
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 The magic mantra Davatang

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We can use it

403
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 If the distance from school is only 10 km

404
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 While our distance from school is thousands of km

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 So the magic mantra Davatang won't work here

406
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Now it's time for us to eat

407
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Take out your lollipop

408
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And share the rest with me

409
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Let's go

410
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 We're almost out of food, Tentara

411
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 That's right, Tentara

412
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Where is it?

413
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 How about we try first?

414
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Wait

415
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Davatang

416
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Food

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Why is there sand?

418
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 There's a lot of sand

419
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 This is a sand field

420
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Not a house for eating

421
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 There's no food

422
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 No lollipop

423
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 No water

424
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 What should we do, Tentara?

425
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 We might die of hunger here

426
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 This is it

427
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 What's up, Tentara?

428
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 We have an idea

429
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 My favorite bicycle

430
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Bicycle?

431
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 We can eat a bicycle

432
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 You're kidding

433
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Hey

434
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 My bicycle

435
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Don't underestimate it

436
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 It's not just a bicycle

437
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 It can bring lollipop here

438
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And food

439
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And drink

440
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 We still have a chance

441
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Hurry up, Tentara

442
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It's not easy to call it

443
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It's a bit difficult

444
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 This is how you call it

445
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Test, test, test

446
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 One, two, three, test

447
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Ontel

448
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Tell Alva

449
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Alva, please prepare

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Five lollipops

451
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Food and drink

452
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Send it to the sand hill

453
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 We're all waiting there

454
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Hurry up

455
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Don't take too long

456
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Okay

457
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Thank you, Ontel

458
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 What do you think, Tentara?

459
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 It's more peaceful here

460
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 There won't be any problem

461
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 [music]

462
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Hey, what are you doing?

463
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Ancik

464
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Get out

465
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Where are you going?

466
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I want you to send it to the sand hill

467
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 It's close

468
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 It's close

469
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 It's close

470
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It's close

471
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 It's close

472
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 It's done

473
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I'll destroy your bike

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Ready

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Go

476
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 You're kidding me

477
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Go

478
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 How can a military bike follow a forest?

479
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 It's a forest

480
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Does it know our plan?

481
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Maybe it heard us

482
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Maybe it didn't hear us

483
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 After that, we'll go to the sand hill

484
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And it'll follow us

485
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Our bike is out of the sand hill

486
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 We'll be in trouble

487
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 If we get hit, we'll get out of the forest

488
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 We'll get hit by the sand hill

489
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 What should we do?

490
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 There's one solution

491
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 What is it?

492
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 We run

493
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Run

494
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Inspiration

495
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Look

496
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Starting tomorrow, I'll make a rule

497
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 The bike that's in the school must be removed

498
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 It seems like the other 300 are gone

499
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I'm sure it's afraid of my threat

500
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 But if it's really you

501
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Why did it follow me?

502
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Or

503
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Is it still alive?

504
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 We're here

505
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Yes, professor?

506
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I want to ask you

507
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 You have to answer honestly

508
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 If not, I'll punish you

509
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 I'll answer honestly, professor

510
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Answer

511
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Is it true that I'm still alive?

512
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Or is it really dead?

513
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Answer

514
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Is it true that I'm still alive?

515
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Answer

516
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Is it true that I'm still alive?

517
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Professor is evil

518
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Why did you ask that?

519
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Why did you ask that?

520
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 You want to make me sad again?

521
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 You're all dust now

522
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Professor is evil

523
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 So it's really dead

524
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So it was really a ghost

525
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 People are right

526
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 If a person is evil, it means he's evil

527
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 But still

528
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Even if he's not dead, he's still a ghost

529
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Professor is evil

530
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Shut up

531
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 To be continued

532
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 To be continued

533
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 To be continued

534
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 To be continued

535
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 To be continued

536
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 To be continued

537
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 We can do this

538
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 We can do this

539
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 We can do this

540
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 We can do this

541
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 We can do this

542
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 We can do this

543
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 We can do this

544
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 We can do this

545
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 We can do this

546
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 We can do this

547
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Let's go to the restaurant

548
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Let's go

549
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Professor is chasing us

550
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 We have to go

551
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Why don't we just go with him?

552
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 We can do it

553
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 I'm tired of running

554
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 I'm tired of being chased

555
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 I'm scared

556
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Let's just play

557
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Sit, rest, sleep

558
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 We can play like friends

559
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Like friends?

560
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 I'm scared

561
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Who threw trash in my room?

562
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Who threw trash in my room?

563
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 You're too much

564
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Today, I will finish you

565
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Get ready

566
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Don't come in, I'm not sleepy

567
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Get in

568
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 I'll go this way

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 I'll go this way

570
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Get in

571
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Be careful, Gara

572
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 It's been a decade

573
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 It turns out that the science of the universe is not the same as the one in the world

574
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Come here, Gara

575
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Finish him, Gara

576
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 You're such a bad guy

577
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Until when?

578
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 The number can't beat him

579
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 And if it can, he will disappear

580
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 And make the number feel

581
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 What are you doing here?

582
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Professor, hurry up

583
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 We're doing nothing

584
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Excuse me, Professor Purwa

585
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 I'm preparing the rehearsal for tomorrow

586
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 You're smiling

587
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Professor Purwa

588
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 I also have to prepare the rehearsal for tomorrow

589
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Me too, Professor

590
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Wait

591
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 You're not teaching

592
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 What are you preparing?

593
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 I mean, I'm preparing the medicine

594
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Who knows, someone got hurt after fighting inside

595
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Someone got hurt?

596
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 What's this?

597
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Adi

598
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 What are you doing here?

599
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Answer me!

600
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 [The number can't beat him]

601
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 What's that?

602
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Jip Jip Jip Jip Jip Jip

603
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 There's another guy

604
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 [The number can't beat him]

605
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 The girl is scared

606
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 [The number can't beat him]

607
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I got it

608
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 [The number can't beat him]

609
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 It's just a ball monster

610
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 I thought it was a flood

611
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Angkara

612
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 It turns out that you're afraid of me

613
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 It's really sad

614
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 I'm more afraid of you than of a girl

615
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 I'm going to school

616
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Shut up!

619
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It's raining

620

627

 You told me to go up there?

628
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 What are you doing?

629
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 I'm going to jump like this

630
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:33,000

 What are you doing?

638
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 If you see this door, I'll be mad

639
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 So, I want to pay you back

640
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 I know

641
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 So, you want me to open this door?

642
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Okay, jump

643
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 I told you

 [The number can't beat him]

645
00:40:37,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Bicycle?

646
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 What do you want?

 [The number can't beat him]

 This bicycle is so weird

649
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 Maybe the army asked this bicycle to do something

650
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Like that

651
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000

 [The number can't beat him]

653
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 So, you're looking for lollipop?

654
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 This is so weird

655
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 We already have our own lollipop

656
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 How many do you want?

657
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 One?

658
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Why are you sleeping?

659
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 Why?

660
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 You want more?

661
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Tell me

662
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 This much?

663
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Four is enough?

664
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Five?

665
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000

 So, you want food too?

669

 I'll send you my greetings

678

 Tell the army, Nick and the others

679

 Tell them

680
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 They have to go home safely

681
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Bye, bicycle!

682
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 [The number can't beat him]

683
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Where are you? I can find you

684
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 I've run so far

685
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 He can't catch me

686
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 I've told you so many times

687

 Wherever you go

688
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 I can find you

689
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 So, you better not reject me

690
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 You're my student

691
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 So, you'll be a great sniper

692
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 A strong sniper

693
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 And you'll have a lot of followers

694
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 [The number can't beat him]

695
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 The army is coming

696
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 I'm scared

697
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 The army is coming

698
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 I'm scared too

699
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 You all have to be patient

700
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Be patient

701
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Wait

702
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 I heard a poem

703
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Eat in front of the soldiers

704
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 If we're hungry

705
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 We better drink first

706
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Oh, no

707
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 What about the army?

708
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 We've run out of drinks

709
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Yes, the army

710
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 I'm so thirsty

711
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 I'm thirsty

712
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 There's no army in the desert

713
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 There's no army drink

714
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 Wait

715
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 I just remembered

716
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 We can chant the water of the phoenix

717
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Which was taught by Prof. Titan

718
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 You still remember, right?

719
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 So, we're still close

720
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 That's it

721
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 What if I try?

722
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 What?

723
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 The water of the phoenix

724
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 The water of the phoenix is useless here

725
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 It's broken

726
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Oh, no

727
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Hey, listen

728
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 We're in the desert

729
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Even though the water of the phoenix is powerful

730
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 But the water of the phoenix can't create water

731
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 The water of the phoenix can only move water

732
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 From the water source around us

733
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 If the water of the phoenix doesn't work

734
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 It means there's no water source around here

735
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 I'm so thirsty

736
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 What?

737
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 It's really cool

738
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 Where's the water?

739
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 I can't see it

740
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 What's wrong?

741
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 The army is taking one of the 12 soul stones

742
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 One of the soul stones?

743
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 What's a soul stone, Prof?

744
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 It's a part of the black magic

745
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Black magic?

746
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 In the past

747
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 There was a sorcerer named Sergius

748
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 Sergius?

749
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,900
 Dive in and around the chicken.

750
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:28,900
 All you need to do is concentrate on the chicken.

752

 He's not a normal human.

753
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 And his power is very sadistic.

754
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 Let's get out of here.

755
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 Is that all you got?

756
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 In the old times,

757
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 there was a evil sorcerer named Cerberus.

758
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 It turned out that Cerberus used a soul stone to protect his power.

759
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 And he divided his soul into 12 parts.

763
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 That's why he can't be defeated.

764
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 And every time someone tries to kill him,

765
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 his soul will be revived.

766
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 And that will bring him back to life.

767
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 The evil of Cerberus kept happening.

768
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 That's what made all the good sorcerers unite to try to defeat him.

775
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 [music]

776
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 [music]

777
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 [music]

778
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 And after the 12 soul stones were destroyed,

779
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Cerberus was defeated.

780
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 [music]

781
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 There are two sets of soul stones in this world.

782
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 One of them was used by Cerberus.

783
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 The other was kept by Professor Aldebaran.

784
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 But without anyone's knowledge,

785
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 the Dark Lord managed to take the soul stone from Professor Aldebaran.

786
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 And he used the soul stone to protect his power.

787
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 Are you ready for me to enter the magical world to be the chosen one?

788
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 [music]

789
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 [music]

790
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 What's wrong, Yaya? Are you afraid of him?

791
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 No, I'm not willing to work with you.

792
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 [music]

793
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 [music]

794
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 Leon, all decisions are in your hands.

795
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 So you have to think carefully.

796
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 If you refuse me,

797
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 it's the same.

798
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 You will be separated from your family forever.

799
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 [music]

800
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 Leon, no.

801
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 Please don't.

802
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 Don't, Leon.

803
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 Maybe you've never heard of my prison.

804
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 So, there's nothing wrong with it.

805
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 I'm just a little afraid of you.

806
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 The fire prison is a prison surrounded by many people.

807
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 And the guards are very cruel.

808
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 If we make a little mistake,

809
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 we will be stabbed with a sharp sword.

810
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 Try to imagine that.

811
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 Think about it.

812
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 [music]

813
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 Wait.

814
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 [music]

815
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 [laughing]

816
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 Good, good.

817
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
 [laughing]

818
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 [music]

819
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 No.

820
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 Don't.

821
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 Please don't.

822
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 Don't, Leon.

823
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 [music]

824
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 Sir.

825
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 [music]

826
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 What's wrong, sir?

827
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 My grandson...

828
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 has become...

829
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 a dark man.

830
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 [music]

831
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 If so,

832
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 we have to find a way out of here.

833
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 Leon.

834
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 Leon.

835
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 Welcome to the palace.

836
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 Dafatang Juba.

837
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 Leon.

838
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 Now, you use it.

839
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 Why?

840
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 This juba indicates how deep your knowledge is.

841
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
 If this juba turns black,

842
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 then,

843
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 your knowledge will be deeper.

844
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
 Let's eat.

845
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 Dafatang, food.

846
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 [laughing]

847
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 You can finish it all.

848
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 Come on.

849
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 [music]

850
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 There's one thing you don't know, Leon.

851
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 That juba is the mirror of your heart.

852
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 Juba budi.

853
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
 It means your heart is still clean.

854
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 The darker the juba is,

855
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 the darker and evil your heart is.

856
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 When the juba changes color to red,

857
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 that's when your heart changes to black and evil.

858
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 And at that time,

859
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 you're ready for me to enter the magic room

860
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 to be the chosen one.

861
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 [laughing]

862
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 So, where is the King of the Wild now?

863
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 We don't know yet.

864
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 We've tried to force Professor Angkara to tell us where Professor Aldebaran is.

865
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 But until now,

866
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
 he's still keeping it a secret.

867
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 Wow.

868
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 So, Professor Angkara deliberately kept it a secret from us?

869
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 Yes, Alva.

870
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
 But don't worry.

871
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 We're still trying to investigate him and find out where Professor Aldebaran is.

872
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Hmm.

873
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 I have a better idea.

874
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 What is it, Alva?

875
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 Just leave it to us.

876
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 It's morning already.

877
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 It's morning already.

878
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 Hey, wake up. It's morning.

879
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 Acting like an intel agent.

880
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 Eating two jellies at a time.

881
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Where is that jelly?

882
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 Why isn't it here yet?

883
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 Oh, no. This is dangerous.

884
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 I have to call him again.

885
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 Why is he calling me?

886
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 Maybe he's not connected.

887
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 Test, test, one, two, three.

888
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 Test, test.

889
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 Check, check. Test, one, two, three.

890
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 Ontel?

891
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
 Ontel?

892
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 Do you hear me?

893
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 Roger?

894
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 What's in the coffee, Ontel?

895
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 Oh, no.

896
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 I hope he doesn't wake up.

897
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 What should I do?

898
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 I can't even crawl.

899
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
 I don't know why I'm in this situation.

900
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 It's not a jelly.

901
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 Hey, wake up.

902
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 It's morning already.

903
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 Intara, where are you?

904
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 Did you get the jellies?

905
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 There are fruits,

906
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 feeding the animals,

907
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 the stroller,

908
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
 the blanket,

909
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 the fire,

910
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 the children,

911
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 and Ontel hasn't come yet.

912
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 Intara, we could die of hunger here.

913
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 Yes, Intara.

914
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 Intara, I'll join you.

915
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 I'm so weak, Intara.

916
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 What should I do?

917
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
 Me too, Intara.

918
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 Kids, today we're going to learn...

919
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 how to turn ordinary water...

920
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
 into grape juice.

921
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 Now, pay attention...

922
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 and listen to the mantra.

923
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
 Javadi.

924
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Good morning.

925
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
 I'm the one who will lead you to teach.

926
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
 Angkara.

927
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 I mean, Professor Angkara.

928
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
 Please don't disturb my lesson, Professor.

929
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 You're so rude, Agni.

930
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 How dare you forbid me?

931
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
 Have you forgotten who I am?

932
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 I'm the head of the school here.

933
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
 Professor Angkara.

934
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
 Agni, I didn't forbid you.

935
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 Get out of my way.

936
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
 Now, kids.

937
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 Whoever succeeds in following my instructions...

938
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
 will get a prize.

939
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 Come on.

940
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 Who wants to go first?

941
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 I want to talk.

942
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 Oh, it's you, Tommy.

943
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 The smart kid.

944
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
 Come on.

945
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 Go ahead, Tommy.

946
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 Go ahead.

947
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 Tommy.

948
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 Now, follow my mantra.

949
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
 Javadi Rajo.

950
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 Javadi Rajo?

951
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 Did I succeed, Professor?

952
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 Where's the prize?

953
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 Not yet, Tommy.

954
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
 Because I have to prove it first.

955
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
 Is this water...

956
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
 really poisoned?

957
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 How?

958
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 The way is...

959
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 one of your classmates...

960
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
 must drink this water.

961
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
 Angkara. / Agni.

962
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 Please don't hurt my son.

963
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
 If you disturb me again,

964
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 I'll have another lesson from you.

965
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 (The mantra is very powerful.)

966
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
 (Whoever gets affected by this mantra...)

967
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 (will die.)

968
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 (We can do it.)

969
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 (We can do it.)

970
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 (We can do it.)

971
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
 (We can do it.)

972
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 Come on.

973
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 Who wants to taste this water?

974
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 Please be my opponent.

975
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 Come on, kids.

976
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 Go ahead.

977
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 Professor, I'm an opponent.

978
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 So, you're Vega.

979
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
 It seems like you're suitable to be my opponent.

980
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
 Please go ahead.

981
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 Vega, go ahead.

982
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 Or I'll give you a punishment.

983
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
 Professor Angkara, please.

984
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
 Don't hurt my kids. / Hurry.

985
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
 Vega, go ahead.

986
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
 Don't, Vega.

987
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 Don't.

988
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 Vega.

989
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 Professor Angkara, don't hurt my kids.

990
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 Quiet.

991
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 Vega.

992
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 (The mantra is very powerful.)

993
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 (Whoever gets affected by this mantra...)

994
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
 (will die.)

995
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 Guys.

996
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
 Give them this water.

997
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 Yes, Professor.

998
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 If they're separated,

999
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
 you'll get a reward.

1000
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 Yes.

1001
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 Yes, Professor.

1002
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
 Drink it.

1003
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 Hurry.

1004
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 Yes, Vega.

1005
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
 Drink it.

1006
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
 Drink it.

1007
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
 So, I'll get the reward.

1008
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 Hurry.

1009
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 Drink it.

1010
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
 Drink it.

1011
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 Vega.

1012
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 Vega.

1013
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 Drink it, Vega.

1014
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 (The mantra is very powerful.)

1015
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
 (Whoever gets affected by this mantra...)

1016
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 (will die.)

1017
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 You're not funny.

1018
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 Follow me.

1019
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 Professor Angkara, wait.

1020
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 Professor.

1021
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 Vega.

1022
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 Stand here and raise one of your legs.

1023
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 Hurry.

1024
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 Today,

1025
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 I'll punish you.

1026
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 Stand here and raise one of your legs until the afternoon.

1027
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 You're not allowed to eat or drink.

1028
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 How long will you run away from here?

1029
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:24,000
 Vega, wait.

1030
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:33,000
 Oh, my goodness.

1031
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 It's so big, Vega.

1032
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
 Let's help Vega.

1033
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 Let's go.

1034
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 Don't you dare to help him.

1035
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 If you dare to help him,

1036
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 you'll be punished severely.

1037
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 Guys, don't worry.

1038
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 I'll teach him well.

1039
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 Agni.

1040
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
 Teach him again.

1041
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 -I'm sorry, Vega. -This is an order.

1042
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 (The mantra is very powerful.)

1043
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 Agni.

1044
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 Hey, wait.

1045
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 Let's go.

1046
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 Guys.

1047
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 You're hungry, right?

1048
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
 How about we try to find food,

1049
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 drink, or anything...

1050
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 so we won't die here?

1051
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 Where are we going, Nick?

1052
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 My body is so weak. I can't walk.

1053
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 Yes, Nick.

1054
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
 At least, we try.

1055
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
 At least, we won't starve.

1056
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 If we starve, we'll try.

1057
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
 I remember I read a book.

1058
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 In the forest,

1059
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 sometimes, there's a spring called...

1060
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
 oasis.

1061
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 It means we still have hope.

1062
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 Do you want to join us?

1063
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
 No.

1064
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
 -No. -No.

1065
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 I can't stand it anymore, Nick.

1066
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
 -I'm so tired. -Alright, Nick.

1067
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
 I'll join you.

1068
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 Instead of starving to death here.

1069
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
 I won't join you.

1070
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
 I can't stand it.

1071
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
 I'll try to find food.

1072
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 Hey.

1073
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
 Wait.

1074
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
 You're just a kid.

1075
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
 Where are you going?

1076
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 We're looking for water, soldier.

1077
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
 Yes, soldier.

1078
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
 Anything. Hamptons can eat.

1079
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 No.

1080
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
 Don't.

1081
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
 Come here.

1082
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
 Go back.

1083
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 This is a desert, bro.

1084
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
 Don't play in the desert.

1085
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 It's dangerous.

1086
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 There are many wild animals.

1087
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 Many weird animals.

1088
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 If you're eaten, it'll be a disaster.

1089
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 Come here. Go back.

1090
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 Be patient.

1091
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
 Soon, my bike...

1092
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 will come here.

1093
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 Bike again.

1094
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
 Dream.

1095
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
 How long do we have to wait?

1096
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
 Since yesterday, there's no bike, soldier.

1097
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
 Do you want us to starve to death here?

1098
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 Soldier.

1099
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
 If you don't want to go,

1100
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 if you don't want us to starve,

1101
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
 we have to fight to find food and drink.

1102
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
 Yes, soldier.

1103
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
 We don't want to die here.

1104
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
 We'd better die when we're looking for water...

1105
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
 than die here.

1106
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 That's right.

1107
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
 Okay, let's go.

1108
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,000
 I'm with them.

1109
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 But what about them?

1110
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 I'm worried.

1111
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
 A rat.

1112
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
 A rat.

1113
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
 There.

1114
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,000
 So, you've met your trial rat.

1115
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
 Trial rat?

1116
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 What do you mean, sir?

1117
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
 This rat...

1118
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 will help you learn mantra.

1119
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
 Because I'll teach you...

1120
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
 a lot of mantras.

1121
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 Mantra?

1122
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:02,000
 What mantra, sir?

1123
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
 Look.

1124
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:19,000
 This mantra is very powerful.

1125
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
 It will make you scream.

1126
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
 Just like that rat.

1127
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
 Stop.

1128
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
 Stop.

1129
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 Now, do what I've done.

1130
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
 That rat's mantra.

1131
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
 Before this bell rings.

1132
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
 (The trial rat)

1133
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
 Sir, I have to torture this rat.

1134
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
 No. I don't want this rat to get hurt.

1135
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
 If you refuse, your brother will suffer.

1136
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
 And if you obey all his orders,

1137
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
 your brother will get happiness.

1138
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
 He will get food in prison.

1139
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
 All decisions are up to you.

1140
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
 Listen.

1141
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
 If you refuse,

1142
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
 your brother will be stabbed by a knife.

1143
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:39,000
 Guys.

1144
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
 We have to run.

1145
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
 Why?

1146
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
 Why, Feca?

1147
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
 There's a rat.

1148
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:54,000
 I'm here because I want to quit.

1149
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
 Lies.

1150
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
