 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

 Be brave, don't give up

 Chase your dreams and hopes

 Go, go, go, run with courage

 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

 Go, go, go, we can do it

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Ria, Danrio, and the police

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 What are you doing here?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 What did you put in here?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I didn't put anything

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Don't lie

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I saw something

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And you put something here

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 What?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Everything is destroyed because of Alva

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 She destroyed our party

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Alva is so stubborn

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 She doesn't care if she meets a kid

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 She's so stubborn

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Unlike Alva, she's not a snake

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Unless there's a clear reason

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You should stop defending her

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 She can grow up

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Maybe the map you gave me is broken

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 What do you mean?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Yes, because there's a professor named Kara

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And he's always hanging out with a new kid

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 His name is Rio

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 That means there's a professor named Kara near Rio

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 What confuses me is that Rio is always alone

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 The professor is using the dust to protect the school

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 But why is there still a professor named Kara?

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I don't know

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Maybe because the professor is in the toilet

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Rio! Rio! Rio!

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Why are they calling me?

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Maybe they're influenced by the brown

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I have to find out

 Calm down

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 All of your kids are now influenced

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 It's time to do the kudeta

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 What's kudeta?

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Rio! Rio!

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Kudeta means

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 To rebel against this school

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000

 It sounded like someone was here

 Professor Kara!

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's impossible Alva, impossible

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 The map can't be broken

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 If you see the name of the base on this map

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It means the base is there

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 No, I always tease Rio

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 But she's always alone

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Or maybe the professor is pretending to be Rio

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Impossible

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It's more likely that she's pretending to be something

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 For example?

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Like an animal

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Yes, an animal

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Ankara might be pretending to be an animal

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 An animal?

 Yes, I know that hamster

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 It looks like Rio

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000

 Rio, you're dead

 I will fulfill all your requests

 Very good, Rio

 Very good

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Then I have to tell the professor about this

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I agree, Ava

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 You should go home now

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 What about mom and dad?

 We haven't found the intruder who likes to come here

 If you manage to catch Ankara

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 All these stupid attacks will stop

 This is all Ankara's doing

 I'm sure

 What do you mean by children's magician?

 Professor, Rio is evil, professor

 He has bewitched children

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And he's in a group with Professor Ankara

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 So, Rio and Ankara have bewitched the students?

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 That's right, professor

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 But why did Rio and Ankara take everyone to the forest?

 Where are they going, professor?

 Because I'm sure

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 All of this is a trap from the 8th prince

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I'll be going, prof

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And Agni, you have to make a love potion

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 A love potion?

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Because Rio has bewitched all the children with a love potion

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 If not, all the children won't obey him

174

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Yes, prof

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And the rest stay here

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I have a good idea

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 That can make the eyes come out of their hiding

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Guys, lift your tongs

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And blow up the tree you like

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Now!

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Go! Go! Go!

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Let's continue

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Rio! Rio! Rio!

203
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Mr. Ketua, we're coming

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Welcome to our castle

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Welcome to our castle

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Sir, our plan is going well

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 All the magic school students are influenced by love potions

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So, they all follow all the words from Rio

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Good, good

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 You're smart

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Sir, why only Rio?

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 I'm also a student

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 So, I'm smart too, sir

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 What do you want now?

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You're jealous of a kid?

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Good, good

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You're smart

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Where's Alva?

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Why isn't Alva here?

220
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Alva skipped school, sir

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 It seems Alva is heartbroken

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Because all her friends are following Rio

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Sir, I'm sorry

224
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I'm sorry, sir

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I'm sorry, sir

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I'm sorry, sir

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I'm sorry, sir

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Sir!

229
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Now, continue with the plan

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Yes, sir

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Are you still following my words?

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Yes, sir

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 You want to help me, right?

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Yes, sir

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 We'll destroy the magic school

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Especially, Agni and Alirbaran

237
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Are you ready?

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Yes, sir

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Good

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 How's it going, Agni?

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Is Ramona ready?

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Yes, sir

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Good

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Then, we all have to get ready

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Because I'm sure

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 The Dark Palace will attack our school

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Are you sure, sir?

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 We want to attack our own children

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I'm sure

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 The Dark Palace will attack our own children

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 As long as you all remember

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 No matter what, they're still our children

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So, you have to use another way

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Different from how you defeat the adults

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Now, listen to me

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 We'll destroy this school

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And crush all the teachers

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 If you have any problem

259
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Use the magic on your left hand

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Understand?

261
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Yes, sir

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Good

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Then, attack!

264
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 In a moment

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Alirbaran will be defeated by my soldiers

266
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And the magic school

267
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Will be mine

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 That's right, sir

269
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And in a moment

270
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I'll be the head of the magic school again

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 You're always following me

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Shut up!

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 The teacher is coming

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 The teacher is coming

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 The teacher is coming

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Why did the teacher go to the pool first?

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 That means

278
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 We can defeat the teacher

279
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yes!

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 That's right

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yes!

282
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Yes!

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Done

284
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 We're in the teacher's hands

285
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 That's not my favorite food!

286
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 It's mine!

287
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 It's mine!

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It's mine!

289
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Why are we here?

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And why are we in the school?

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 To sleep?

292
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 The teacher is coming

293
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 The teacher is coming

294
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Wake up, sir!

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Wake up, sir!

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Wake up, sir!

297
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Wake up, sir!

298
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Be quiet!

299
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The teacher is coming

300
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Let's make the school more fun

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Yes!

302
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 The teacher is just joking

303
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 What does the teacher mean by joking?

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 I don't understand

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 You have been bewitched by Rio

306
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 We were bewitched by Rio!

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Rio?

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Yes

309
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Do you know?

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 No

311
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 You were told to attack me

312
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And to destroy the school

313
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 But luckily, Professor Agni has made a plan to catch you

314
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And you were caught

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 By the candy you ate

316
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 So, Professor Perwang is dead because of us, right?

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Of course not

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 But you will still be punished

319
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Punished?

320
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Punished?

321
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 What did we do wrong, Professor?

322
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Professor's red lips

323
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Be careful

324
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Forgive me!

325
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Don't hurt me!

326
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Please, forgive me!

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Don't hurt me!

328
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Who is it?

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 The one who entered the coconut palace

330
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Please, let me in!

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I will give you the candy

332
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Please, don't kill me!

333
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I will kill you!

334
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Don't hurt me!

335
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I will kill you!

336
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 What are you doing here?

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 I don't know

338
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Please, let me in!

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Please, let me in!

340
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 It's amazing!

341
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Thank God, you all realized

342
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 You were hypnotized by Rio

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And you were made into the darkness's army

344
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 What darkness?

345
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 That's right!

346
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Thank you, Rio

347
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Thank you

348
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It's so delicious

349
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 It's delicious

350
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Now I'm ready

351
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 I don't have to do anything

352
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Thank you

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Thank you

354
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Where did Semin go?

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Attack the Philippines!

356
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 (laughing)

357
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Why is the professor sitting on the floor?

358
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 He's a professor

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Good, you all realized

360
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 As long as you know, Vela and Feli

361
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 You were both hypnotized by Rio

362
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Rio, the great one?

363
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Yes, you don't know who Rio is, right?

364
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Rio is the underling of the darkness's army

365
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 You were both hypnotized

366
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Which means

367
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 You were made into the darkness's army

368
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Do you understand?

369
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 We were made into the darkness's army

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 We were made into the darkness's army

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Yes, we were

372
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 But our hearts

373
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Oh my God

374
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 You two are so stupid

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 You should have known

376
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 He's the one who raped my grandfather

377
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 I have to avenge him

378
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Punish him!

379
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It hurts!

380
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 It hurts!

381
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Rio, why did you have to torture me?

382
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 What did I do wrong?

383
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 The professor's fault is

384
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 You're a liar!

385
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You're a liar!

386
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I didn't hear anything wrong

387
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 You're the one who made me into the darkness's army

388
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 You're so stupid

389
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Let's go!

390
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I want to hear

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Why did you do all of this?

392
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Because I want to avenge him

393
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Because professor Agni ordered to kill my grandfather

394
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Rio, who are you talking about?

395
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Professor Alibaran

396
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 You're the one who hurt my grandfather

397
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I will avenge him!

398
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Don't be so arrogant

399
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Professor Alibaran is a good man

400
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 He won't kill your grandfather

401
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Shut up!

402
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You don't know anything

403
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Enough!

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Don't fight

405
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I and professor Agni

406
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Won't kill your grandfather

407
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Rio, we don't even know each other

408
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Impossible!

409
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 You must know who my grandfather is

410
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Rio Nero

411
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Rio Nero?

412
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 No, that's not my real name

413
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But

414
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Leon?

415
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Yes, my name is Leon

416
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And my grandfather's name is Orion

417
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Professor

418
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Orion?

419
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Isn't he the old man in the fire prison?

420
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Yes, that's right

421
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Good!

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 You still remember how sadistic he was to kill my grandfather

423
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Leon, I think you're mistaken

424
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 What do you mean?

425
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 It's obvious that you're the one who burned my grandfather

426
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And you killed my grandfather

427
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 That's not true, Leon

428
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 That's not true, that's a lie!

429
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Leon, you're wrong

430
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Your grandfather is still alive

431
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 He even told me to find you

432
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And save you from the fire prison

433
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 If you come with me

434
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Please save my grandfather

435
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Please

436
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I have high hopes for you

437
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 That's what I want right now

438
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Let's go

439
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 That's impossible!

440
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Come on, Leon

441
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Come with us

442
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Leave the Dark Lord

443
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Yes, Leon

444
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Come with us

445
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Don't follow the Dark Lord, he's evil

446
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Yes, Leon

447
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I believe that the Dark Lord is evil

448
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 What do you want?

449
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 You don't know anything!

450
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 You're lying!

451
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Your story is different from the Dark Lord's story

452
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 It's the opposite, Leon

453
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 The Dark Lord is the one who lied to you

454
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Not us!

455
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Yes, Leon

456
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 No, I don't believe you

457
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 You killed my grandfather!

458
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Professor!

459
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Professor!

460
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Professor Agni!

461
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Leon!

462
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Where are you going?

463
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Leon, don't let him get away

464
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Leon!

465
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Agni!

466
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Hi, Professor

467
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 We can do it!

468
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 We can do it!

469
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 We can do it!

470
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 We can do it!

471
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 We can do it!

472
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 We can do it!

473
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 We can do it!

474
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 We can do it!

475
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 We can do it!

476
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 We can do it!

477
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 We can do it!

478
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 You stay here

479
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I'll meet Professor Agni

480
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 But we're going to join the army, right?

481
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 We're going to join the army, right?

482
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 We miss the army

483
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 How dare you to fight me?

484
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Huh?

485
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 You don't want to listen to me?

486
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 You don't want to obey me?

487
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 You're a coward

488
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 You're a coward, you're a slave hunter

489
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 What are you doing?

490
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Why are we doing this?

491
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 We're a soldier

492
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Let me go, soldier

493
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Don't you dare to fight me

494
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 You're a bad soldier

495
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 You're a bad soldier

496
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 You protect them, don't let them go

497
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 If one of them is released

498
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Then you're a bad person

499
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I'll make you two

500
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I'll change you

501
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 I'll change you

502
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 We're going to fight them

503
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 We're going to fight them

504
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 We're going to fight them

505
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 We're going to fight them

506
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Help!

507
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Yes!

508
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Hold the rope

509
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Why are you helping me?

510
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Of course, sir

511
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 We're your friends

512
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Why are you guys dropping me?

513
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 You should drop Alva

514
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Alva is our enemy

515
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 We're Alva's friends

516
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 So we won't hurt Alva

517
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 You're our enemy

518
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 You guys are

519
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The 8th Pangeran's followers

520
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Kailan is my team

521
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 We're aware

522
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 We won't be hypnotized anymore

523
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 We won't be affected by your emotions

524
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And we won't be with you

525
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 You're stupid

526
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 You're not allowed to be with the 8th Pangeran

527
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 That's noisy

528
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 [The 8th Pangeran]

529
00:30:44,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Leon!

530
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 You're so slow!

531
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 [The 8th Pangeran]

532
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Agni betrayed me

533
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 [The 8th Pangeran]

534
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 He made me work to free your grandfather

535
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 But he poisoned your grandfather

536
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And he even killed his friend

537
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 His name is Adeb Lara

538
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Leon, you're wrong

539
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Your grandfather is still alive

540
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 He's still alive

541
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 He even told me

542
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 To find you

543
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And save you from the 8th Pangeran

544
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Come on, Leon

545
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Come

546
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Come with us

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Leave the 8th Pangeran

548
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I really don't know who's right

549
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Grandfather

550
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 I need you

551
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 [The 8th Pangeran]

552
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 What happened to him?

553
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 He's under the influence of the magic

554
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 It's been a while

555
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 He's still unconscious

556
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 What the...

557
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Professor Agni is poisoned

558
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 He's being poisoned

559
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Come on, Professor Yasmin

560
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Please stay here

561
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I want to go back to my room

562
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Yes, Professor

563
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 [The 8th Pangeran]

564
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Why hasn't Leon lit the fire?

565
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 He should have been in charge of the school

566
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 He's the one who lit the fire

567
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 What if I find out the truth?

568
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Okay, sir

569
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 You find out the truth

570
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Yes, sir

571
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Oh

572
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 What else, sir?

573
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 You're a hamster now

574
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Oh, right

575
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 I forgot, sir

576
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 I'm happy

577
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 You're back to normal

578
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Yes, sir

579
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 We're happy too

580
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 But please forgive me about yesterday

581
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Please forgive us, sir

582
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 I've already forgiven you

583
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 It's not your fault

584
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 It's Leon's fault

585
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 You're under the influence of Leon's magic

586
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Yes, he's so evil

587
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 He's not evil

588
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 He's just under the influence of the 8th Pangeran

589
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Soldiers!

590
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Soldiers!

591
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Soldiers!

592
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Enough!

593
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Let go of him

594
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Or else,

595
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 I'll make your body smell bad

596
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Are you okay, soldier?

597
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 You're the one who's sick

598
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 You're so mean to us, soldier

599
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 You're so bad

600
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I just came here to play with you

601
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I'm not a bully

602
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 I'm a bully, okay?

603
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Soldier, what do you want?

604
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Don't touch me

605
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Soldier,

606
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 You're so mean

607
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 You're so mean

608
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Why are you acting like a girl?

609
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Soldier,

610
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 You're so mean to a girl

611
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 You're such a big kid

612
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 You're talking nonsense

613
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 You said I'm a bully

614
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 As you know,

615
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 This is the briefcase I'm using

616
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Not yours

617
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Then, what's that?

618
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 It's none of your business

619
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 What are you doing?

620
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 You're so nosy

621
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 You're so mean

622
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Now,

623
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 I want to ask you

624
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Where's professor Alibaran?

625
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 I want to meet him

626
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 He's taking care of professor Agni

627
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Who's fainted

628
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 What?

629
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Professor Agni

630
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Fainted?

631
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I'm surprised by this school

632
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 A teacher who easily fainted

633
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And became weak

634
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Is still being used as a teacher

635
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Enough

636
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 I want to go

637
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 I want to go

638
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I don't want to talk to you

639
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I want to find professor Alibaran

640
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Why are you so mean?

641
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Okay, calm down

642
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Don't think about it

643
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 I'll go to the toilet

644
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 I'm scared

645
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 I can't just stay still

646
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 I have to prove who's right

647
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 I have to catch the fire

648
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 But

649
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 I don't know where the fire station is

650
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 I'm so scared

651
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Me too

652
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I'm so hungry

653
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 One way to be safe

654
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 We have to go to school

655
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 There must be a lot of people there

656
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Where are we going?

657
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 We're going to take a ticket

658
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 What?

659
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 I know

660
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 What?

661
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 We have to jump together

662
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 That's a good idea

663
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Let's try

664
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 1, 2, 3

665
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 That's my idea

666
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Let's do it again

667
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 1, 2, 3

668
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 I'm so scared

669
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Stand up

670
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Come on

671
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 One more time

672
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Come on

673
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Ready?

674
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 There's a fire!

675
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 I'm so scared

676
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 I'm so scared

677
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Sit down

678
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 My feet are on the toilet

679
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 I'm so scared

680
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 I'm so scared

681
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Where's Leon?

682
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 It's so quiet here

683
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 I can smell him

684
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 He's in the toilet

685
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 [The school is so noisy]

686
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 This school is so noisy

687
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 Is there a rat in this school?

688
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 What kind of school is this?

689
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 The rat trap

690
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Why is there a trap here?

691
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 [The rat is following me]

692
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Why am I being followed?

693
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 I'm so lucky

694
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 [I'm safe]

 [I'm safe]

696
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Leon, how was it?

697
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Did you beat all the teachers in this school?

698
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 I did!

699
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 Leon, you're a great kid

700
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 You're so cool

701
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 I want to give you a present

702
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 What is it?

703
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 This is for you

704
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 You're so mean

705
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 This is for celebrating our success

706
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:12,000

710
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Hi, Mr. Teacher

711
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 How dare you to play with me?

712
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Take this!

713
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000

 I don't have enough energy

720

 I think this is because I got hurt

721

 But I'm going to try again

722

 Let's dance again!

770
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Let's go!

771
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 I have to give this to my uncle

772
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Here's your paper and pen!

773
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Uncle,

774
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Professor Ankara's problem is solved

775
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 There won't be any more infiltrators in my house

776
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 And please, tell your mom and dad

777
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 that I miss them

778
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Alva!

779
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Get my uncle's hand!

780
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Hi, uncle!

781
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Please, do this!

782
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 [Alva's love story]

783
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 So, Alva gave her love story to Professor Ankara?

784
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 Yes!

785
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 So, Professor Ankara is in love with Alva?

786
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 And you did all of this to prevent the chaos?

787
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 That's right, Prof!

788
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 Wow, so, you agree with us?

789
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 We're good, right?

790
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 You're working with us?

791
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 To be honest,

792
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 I think this is a dangerous plan

793
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 and full of risks

794
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 But, there's nothing wrong with it

795
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Let's do it!

796
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Yes!

797
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 Let's continue our discussion!

798
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 Okay!

799
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 [The Pupils' School]

800
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 [The Pupils' School]

801
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 [The Pupils' School]

802
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 [The Pupils' School]

803
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 [The Pupils' School]

804
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 [The Pupils' School]

805
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 [The Pupils' School]

 [The Pupils' School]

807
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 [The Pupils' School]

808
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 Now, I've liberated the school from the dust

809
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 And now, the dust is back to its place

810
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 So, what's your plan?

811
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 What else can I do, Sir?

812
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 Professor Ankara, please call Mr. Rd. Jelapan

813
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 Yes, Sir

814
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 But, you first

815
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 I'll call him first

816
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Okay

817
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Good evening, Sir

818
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 How's it going?

819
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 Any good news?

820
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Our mission is successful, Sir

821
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 And now, I'm asking you to come to the school in the afternoon

822
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 Right now, Sir

823
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 Good, Sir!

824
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 I'll be there soon, Sir

825
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Okay, Sir

826
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 But, we'll meet in the school's hall

827
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 Now, the hall is no longer protected by the dust, Sir

828
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 You're great, Sir!

829
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Now, it's time to release Mr. Rd. Jelapan

830
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 Stop it!

831
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 Megantara has come back to the school!

832
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 How's it going? Have you got the soul stone?

833
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 What are you doing?

834
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 I'm curious

835
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 You don't need to know

836
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 Now, I want to ask you

837
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 Where's Professor Aldebaran?

838
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 I don't know where Professor Aldebaran is

839
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 How can you not know where Aldebaran is?

840
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 You meet him every day

841
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 Where is he? Tell me

842
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 I don't know!

843
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 You're so arrogant!

844
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 Just answer me!

845
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Just answer me!

846
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 Just answer me!

847
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 Beautiful, amazing!

848
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 Why are you so rude?

849
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 You're getting more and more arrogant every day

850
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 I asked you nicely, where's Aldebaran?

851
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 You answered me like that

852
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Where's Aldebaran?

853
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Don't talk nonsense!

854
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 I'm Megantara, the fearless warrior!

855
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 He's so cute

856
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 He's like a little baby

857
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 It's better to sleep there

858
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Than to be with a boy like him

859
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 Welcome, Dark Prince

860
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 Anggara, Leon, and all of you

861
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 I'm so happy

862
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Our plan is a success

863
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 Who's first?

864
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 Leon, and Professor Anggara

865
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 And we are Rion's team!

866
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 Good, good

867
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 Why is Alva here?

868
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 Sir, all the teachers at Sir's school have given up on me

869
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 Even Alva is now your follower

870
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Finally, Aldebaran is bowing to you

871
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 And soon, Alva will be mine too

872
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 You're the one who will bow to the Dark Prince

873
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 Sir, to celebrate our success

874
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 Please drink this

875
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 What is this?

876
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 That's a herbal tea, Sir

877
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 For our body to be healthy and strong

878
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 We have to drink herbal tea

879
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 I'm sorry, Sir

880
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 Herbal tea

881
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 Okay, then drink it

882
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 Why, Sir?

883
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 I'm not ashamed

884
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 After drinking this herbal tea

885
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 I fell asleep

886
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 Who knows

887
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 There's something weird about this herbal tea

888
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 Okay, Sir

889
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 How is it, Anggara?

890
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 The herbal tea is good, Sir

891
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 If it's good, why did you drink it all?

892
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 You should have left some for me

893
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 I'm sorry, Sir

894
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 Because it's already good, Sir

895
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 What is this?

896
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 Why is it so bitter?

897
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 Get out of here, Prince!

898
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 Drink this water, so it won't be bitter anymore

899
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 I'm thirsty

900
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 I'm thirsty

901
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 Don't look for it!

902
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 Don't look for it!

903
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 It's bitter

904
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 Don't look for it!

905
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 With this, you won't be able to drink it anymore

906
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 We did it!

907
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 Yes!

908
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 Alphon!

909
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 Girls, we did it!

910
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 Yes!

911
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 Agni, wait

912
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 You attacked me?

913
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 Just attack me!

914
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 I'm not afraid

915
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 Attack!

916
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Attack, Alphon!

917
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 We can do it

918
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 We can do it

919
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 Virgo?

920
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 Where are you from, Virgo?

921
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 What is this?

922
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 Ankara has been successfully captured by Alphon

923
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 Good

924
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 That's good

925
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 I'm a soldier now

926
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 I'm a soldier now

927
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 Good

928
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 That's good

929
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 I'm a soldier now

930
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 Because I'm sure that after this, no one will come to my house

931
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 Thank you, Virgo

932
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 What now?

933
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 What now?

934
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 I'll tie it with a rope

935
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 Sir, don't

936
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 Not yet

937
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 Because if you tie it with a normal rope

938
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 The monster will be able to escape

939
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 It's very strong

940
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
 Then what do we use?

941
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 I have a mantra that can make the rope stronger

942
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 And I'm sure that the monster won't be able to escape

943
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 That's easy

944
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 Ravantai Kufu Cin

945
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,000
 What should we do?

946
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 You're wrong to say the mantra

947
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 Okay, I'll say the mantra

948
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 Viva

949
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 Ravantai Kufu Cin

950
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,000
 If we use this rope, the monster won't be able to escape

951
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 But if we tie it, it will be very easy to free it

952
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 Viva Kufu Cin

953
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 Amazing

954
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
 Professor Agnita finally realized

955
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
 Yes, Professor Agnita

956
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 Where is she?

957
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 Professor Agnita is at the clinic

958
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
 Perthiwi Beauty Food, amazing

959
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 Professor Agnita fainted after fighting Leon

960
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 Then?

961
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 Where is the other one?

962
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 Professor Agnita and Alpha Prime are fighting the villain

963
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 The villain is the Darkness Lord

964
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 The Dark Lord?

965
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 Yes, the Darkness Lord

966
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 I have to help him now

967
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 Help the Darkness Lord?

968
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Perthiwi is hearing it wrong

969
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 Or Professor Agnita is freaking out?

970
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 This is dangerous

971
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
 There must be something

972
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 The Dark Lord is coming

973
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 I think the voice is coming from this direction

974
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 But why is there still a follower?

975
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
 Isn't Ankara defeated by Alpha?

976
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 Professor Lebar

977
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 I have an idea

978
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 Professor Yasmin and I have an agreement

979
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 What if the Dark Lord is imprisoned in the backwoods of the school?

980
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 Prison?

981
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Prison?

982
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 Don't worry about the Dark Lord

983
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 I can handle it

984
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 There is also a truth

985
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 Why Ankara?

986
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Then?

987
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 Is there a better idea?

988
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 Wait

989
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 I'll think about it

990
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 Professor Agni?

991
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 He has recovered?

992
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 What is this?

993
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 Why are you all defending the respected Dark Lord?

994
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 The Dark Lord?

995
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 So that's the Dark Lord

996
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 There's another Dark Lord

997
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 But I won't give up

998
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 I have to defeat them

999
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 Let's go

1000
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
 Let's fight together

1001
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 [The Dark Lord is coming]

1002
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 Who dares to do this?

1003
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 Stop!

1004
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 The Dark Lord is evil

1005
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 He's supposed to be in prison

1006
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 So he can't make snakes anymore

1007
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 No, I disagree

1008
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 You all have to free the Dark Lord

1009
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
 Not in a chain like that

1010
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
 Professor Agni, why is the Professor missing?

1011
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 Yes

1012
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
 Professor Agni has been acting weird

1013
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
 What did you say?

1014
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 I'm not weird

1015
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
 I'm not

1016
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
 You all

1017
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 It's true

1018
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 You shouldn't have done that to the Dark Lord

1019
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 What about the other one?

1020
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 Free the Dark Lord in a chain

1021
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
 Agni!

1022
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 Professor Agni!

1023
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 Professor, where are you taking him?

1024
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 Professor, you're acting weird

1025
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 Yes, Professor, don't do that

1026
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 Yes, Professor

1027
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 Free the weapon

1028
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 Professor Agni

1029
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 Defeat the lollipop

1030
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
 The blue one

1031
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 Professor, the blue one

1032
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 Professor Agni

1033
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 Agni, wait

1034
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 You want to attack me?

1035
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 Go ahead

1036
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 I'm not afraid

1037
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 Attack!

1038
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 Professor, wait!

1039
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 Professor, wait!

1040
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 Professor Agni!

1041
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
 Guys, let's go after him

1042
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 Let's go

1043
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
 Professor, wait!

1044
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 Professor, wait!

1045
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
 Let me go!

1046
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 Guys

1047
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 Let's go after him

1048
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
 Let's go

1049
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 I managed to get away from them

1050
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 Agni is defeated

1051
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 They will lose

1052
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
 I'm really hungry

1053
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 Now I got a professor from Syri's school

1054
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 We can do it

1055
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 We can do it

1056
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 We can do it

1057
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
 Why is Professor Agni acting weird?

1058
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
 Since he realized Ramon is from Leon

1059
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
 Agni must be possessed by Ramon Hijau

1060
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
 Ramon Hijau

1061
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
 What Ramon, Professor?

1062
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
 It's a super quality Ramon

1063
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 Super quality Ramon?

1064
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 What does it mean, Professor?

1065
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
 I've heard about Ramon

1066
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 It's not really different from the Ramon you made

1067
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
 But it's a far more powerful version

1068
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 So Ramon made Professor Agni become a god

1069
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 And praise the dark side?

1070
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 Yes

1071
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
 That's right, Professor

1072
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 I'm going to talk to him

1073
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 I want to know what you want

1074
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 He ran away so fast

1075
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 He even followed us with his eyes

1076
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 Who is he?

1077
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:04,000
 I'm going to talk to him

1078
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 He's gone

1079
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
 Where did he go?

1080
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 There he is

1081
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:32,000
 Why am I here?

1082
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
 Why am I here?

1083
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 Who brought you here?

1084
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 I brought you here

1085
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 Why are you in my bed?

1086
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 It's been a long time, Sir

1087
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 We haven't met

1088
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
 You

1089
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 Where are your friends?

1090
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 What do you want?

1091
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
 You

1092
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
 You want to challenge me?

1093
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 Right?

1094
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 Let's go

1095
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 I'm ready to fight you

1096
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
 Don't be mad at me

1097
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 Okay?

1098
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
 Don't joke around

1099
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
 I'm serious

1100
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
 Who's joking?

1101
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
 Agni

1102
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 Look at your left hand

1103
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,000
 There's a mark

1104
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 It means

1105
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 Agni has been hit by a green light

1106
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
 It seems

1107
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 You've been hit by my super love potion

1108
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 Whatever you say, Sir

1109
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
 What's clear is

1110
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
 I'm ready to fight you

1111
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 I'm so proud

1112
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 Now I have a professor from Siri School

1113
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 Professor?

1114
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 Yes

1115
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 How do we make Professor Agni realize?

1116
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
 That's right, that's right

1117
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
 Of course with his offer

1118
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
 I'll make it happen

1119
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 I've promised him

1120
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 No

1121
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
 This offer must be given a special gift

1122
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Special?

1123
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Special?

1124
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
 What's that?

1125
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
 The offer must be added with the dark magic

1126
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 It's scary

1127
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 I don't want to be a baby

1128
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
 What should we do?

1129
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 The dark magic has gone

1130
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 Just leave it to me, Sir

1131
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 I'll get it

1132
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 So you'll find the dark magic

1133
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 And give it to me?

1134
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
 Yes, Sir

1135
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
 Just wait for me

1136
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
 Guys, help our friend

1137
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
 Bro, help our friend

1138
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
 Agni, how can you do that?

1139
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
 It's all because of the soldiers

1140
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
 The soldiers did this to us

1141
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 Sir, don't write it like that

1142
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 You got it wrong

1143
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 I'll finish you

1144
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
 So you can't go back to school

1145
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
 And tell Alva and Alipa

1146
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 Ready

1147
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
