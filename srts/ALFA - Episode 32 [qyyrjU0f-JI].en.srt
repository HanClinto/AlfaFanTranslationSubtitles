1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, run with courage

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ria, Danrio, and the police

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What did you put in here?

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I didn't put anything

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't lie

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I saw something

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And you put something here

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Everything is destroyed because of Alfa

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She destroyed our party

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Alfa is so stubborn

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
She doesn't care if she meets a kid

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She's so stubborn

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Unlike Alfa, she's not a snake

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Unless there's a clear reason

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You should stop defending her

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
She can grow up

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe the map you gave me is broken

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you mean?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes, because there's a professor named Kara

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And he's always hanging out with a new kid

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
His name is Rio

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That means there's a professor named Kara near Rio

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What confuses me is that Rio is always alone

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The professor is using the dust to protect the school

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But why is there still a professor named Kara?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Maybe because the professor is in the toilet

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Rio! Rio! Rio!

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why are they calling me?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Maybe they're influenced by the brown

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have to find out

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hey Rio!

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Calm down

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All of your kids are now influenced

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's time to do the kudeta

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's kudeta?

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Rio! Rio!

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Kudeta means

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To rebel against this school

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
[Laughter]

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It sounded like someone was laughing

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It sounded like someone was here

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Professor Kara!

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's impossible Alfa, impossible

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The map can't be broken

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you see the name of the base on this map

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It means the base is there

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, I always tease Rio

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But she's always alone

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Or maybe the professor is pretending to be Rio

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Impossible

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's more likely that she's pretending to be something

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
For example?

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Like an animal

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, an animal

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ankara might be pretending to be an animal

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
An animal?

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That hamster!

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes, I know that hamster

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It looks like Rio

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Or maybe it's just Professor Ankara

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Rio!

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Professor Ankara

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How dare you to kill my sister?

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Rio, you're dead

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Professor!

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're going to pay for this

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hurry!

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hurry up Rio!

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's been a long time

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Professor!

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Rio, the true leader

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I will fulfill all your requests

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Very good, Rio

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Very good

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then I have to tell the professor about this

88
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I agree, Ava

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You should go home now

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But, uncle

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What about mom and dad?

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We haven't found the intruder who likes to come here

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If you manage to catch Ankara

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All these stupid attacks will stop

95
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Because I'm sure

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is all Ankara's doing

97
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sure

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Good afternoon, children

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Happy Eid

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Where are the children?

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What time is it? They haven't come yet

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Do you want to learn or not?

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Everyone, follow me!

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Where are they?

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've been walking around

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Rio and Professor Ankara

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Have done something to them

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Terrible

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is my map

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Professor!

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's awful!

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's awful, Alfa?

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where are your other friends?

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why haven't they arrived yet?

115
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's him, professor

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Rio, my friends' magician

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Magician?

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What do you mean by children's magician?

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Professor, Rio is evil, professor

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He has bewitched children

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And he's in a group with Professor Ankara

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And Professor Ankara is a hamster

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Alfa, you can't just take his people

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Where do we find the proof?

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Here, professor

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is the map of the sacred place

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All the children are here

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Look, they're here

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They're going to school

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I've heard about this sacred place

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Here, professor

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Look, there's Professor Ankara's writing here

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Right?

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Alfa, we have to tell Professor Lalebaran now

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Come on

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So, Rio and Ankara have bewitched the students?

137
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's right, professor

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But why did Rio and Ankara take everyone to the forest?

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Where are they going, professor?

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Wherever they go

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They're bound to go to the 8th prince

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Because I'm sure

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
All of this is a trap from the 8th prince

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, what do we do, prof?

145
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Titan

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Ah, hello, senior magician

147
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm the professor

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You follow them and find out where they're going

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Give them a smile

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Get ready to do your job

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll be going, prof

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And Agni, you have to make a love potion

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A love potion?

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because Rio has bewitched all the children with a love potion

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If not, all the children won't obey him

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes, professor

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And Alfa, you help my professor

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
To make a lot of love potions

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, prof

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And the rest stay here

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because I'll arrange your plans

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes, prof

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, professor

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Rio! Rio! Rio!

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ahai, give them a smile

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There they are

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
From here

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Rio! Rio! Rio!

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It seems someone is following us

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, professor

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Where are they?

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's just continue

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Wait

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have a good idea

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That can make the eyes come out of their hiding

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Guys, lift your tongs

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And blow up the tree you like

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Now!

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Go! Go! Go!

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's continue

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Rio! Rio! Rio!

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Mr. Ketua, we're coming

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Welcome to our castle

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Sir, our plan is going well

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
All the magic school students are influenced by love potions

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So, they all follow all the words from Rio

189
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Good, good

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're smart

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Sir, why only Rio?

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm also a student

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So, I'm smart too, sir

194
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What do you want now?

195
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're jealous of a kid?

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Good, good

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're smart

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Where's Alfa?

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why isn't Alfa here?

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Alfa skipped school, sir

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It seems Alfa is heartbroken

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Because all her friends are following Rio

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sir, I'm sorry

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm sorry, sir

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Sir!

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Now, continue with the plan

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, sir

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you still following my words?

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, sir

210
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You want to help me, right?

211
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes, sir

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We'll destroy the magic school

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Especially, Agni and Alirbaran

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Are you ready?

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, sir

216
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Good

217
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How's it going, Agni?

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is Ramona ready?

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, sir

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Good

221
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Then, we all have to get ready

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Because I'm sure

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The Dark Palace will attack our school

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Are you sure, sir?

225
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We want to attack our own children

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sure

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The Dark Palace will attack our own children

228
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
As long as you all remember

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No matter what, they're still our children

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So, you have to use another way

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Different from how you defeat the adults

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Now, listen to me

233
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We'll destroy this school

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And crush all the teachers

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you have any problem

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Use the magic on your left hand

237
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Understand?

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes, sir

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Good

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Then, attack!

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In a moment

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Alirbaran will be defeated by my soldiers

243
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And the magic school

244
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Will be mine

245
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's right, sir

246
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And in a moment

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll be the head of the magic school again

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're always following me

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Shut up!

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The teacher is coming

251
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why did the teacher go to the pool first?

252
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That means

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We can defeat the teacher

254
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes!

255
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's right

256
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes!

257
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Done

258
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We're in the teacher's hands

259
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's not my favorite food!

260
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's mine!

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Why are we here?

262
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And why are we in the school?

263
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
To sleep?

264
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The teacher is coming

265
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Wake up, sir!

266
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Be quiet!

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The teacher is coming

268
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's make the school more fun

269
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes!

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The teacher is just joking

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What does the teacher mean by joking?

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't understand

273
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You have been bewitched by Rio

274
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We were bewitched by Rio!

275
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Rio?

276
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Do you know?

278
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No

279
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You were told to attack me

280
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And to destroy the school

281
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But luckily, Professor Agni has made a plan to catch you

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And you were caught

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
By the candy you ate

284
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So, Professor Perwang is dead because of us, right?

285
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Of course not

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But you will still be punished

287
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Punished?

288
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What did we do wrong, Professor?

289
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Professor's red lips

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Be careful

291
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Forgive me!

292
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't hurt me!

293
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Please, forgive me!

294
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't hurt me!

295
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Who is it?

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The one who entered the coconut palace

297
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Please, let me in!

298
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I will give you the candy

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Please, don't kill me!

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I will kill you!

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't hurt me!

302
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I will kill you!

303
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What are you doing here?

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't know

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Please, let me in!

306
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's amazing!

307
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Thank God, you all realized

308
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You were hypnotized by Rio

309
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And you were made into the darkness's army

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What darkness?

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's right!

312
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Thank you, Rio

313
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Thank you

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's so delicious

315
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's delicious

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Now I'm ready

317
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't have to do anything

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you

319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Where did Semin go?

320
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Attack the Philippines!

321
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:57,000
(laughing)

322
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why is the professor sitting on the floor?

323
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He's a professor

324
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Good, you all realized

325
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
As long as you know, Vela and Feli

326
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You were both hypnotized by Rio

327
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Rio, the great one?

328
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yes, you don't know who Rio is, right?

329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Rio is the underling of the darkness's army

330
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You were both hypnotized

331
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Which means

332
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You were made into the darkness's army

333
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Do you understand?

334
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We were made into the darkness's army

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes, we were

336
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But our hearts

337
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh my God

338
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You two are so stupid

339
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You should have known

340
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He's the one who raped my grandfather

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I have to avenge him

342
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Punish him!

343
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It hurts!

344
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Rio, why did you have to torture me?

345
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What did I do wrong?

346
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The professor's fault is

347
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You're a liar!

348
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I didn't hear anything wrong

349
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You're the one who made me into the darkness's army

350
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You're so stupid

351
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Let's go!

352
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I want to hear

353
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Why did you do all of this?

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Because I want to avenge him

355
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because professor Agni ordered to kill my grandfather

356
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Rio, who are you talking about?

357
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Professor Alibaran

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're the one who hurt my grandfather

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I will avenge him!

360
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Don't be so arrogant

361
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Professor Alibaran is a good man

362
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He won't kill your grandfather

363
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Shut up!

364
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You don't know anything

365
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Enough!

366
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't fight

367
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I and professor Agni

368
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Won't kill your grandfather

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Rio, we don't even know each other

370
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Impossible!

371
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You must know who my grandfather is

372
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Rio Nero

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Rio Nero?

374
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
No, that's not my real name

375
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But

376
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Leon?

377
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes, my name is Leon

378
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And my grandfather's name is Orion

379
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Professor

380
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Orion?

381
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Isn't he the old man in the fire prison?

382
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes, that's right

383
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Good!

384
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You still remember how sadistic he was to kill my grandfather

385
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Leon, I think you're mistaken

386
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What do you mean?

387
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's obvious that you're the one who burned my grandfather

388
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And you killed my grandfather

389
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That's not true, Leon

390
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's not true, that's a lie!

391
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Leon, you're wrong

392
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Your grandfather is still alive

393
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He even told me to find you

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And save you from the fire prison

395
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
If you come with me

396
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Please save my grandfather

397
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Please

398
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I have high hopes for you

399
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's what I want right now

400
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Let's go

401
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's impossible!

402
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Come on, Leon

403
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Come with us

404
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Leave the Dark Lord

405
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes, Leon

406
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Come with us

407
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Don't follow the Dark Lord, he's evil

408
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes, Leon

409
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I believe that the Dark Lord is evil

410
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What do you want?

411
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You don't know anything!

412
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You're lying!

413
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Your story is different from the Dark Lord's story

414
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's the opposite, Leon

415
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The Dark Lord is the one who lied to you

416
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Not us!

417
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yes, Leon

418
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No, I don't believe you

419
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You killed my grandfather!

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Professor!

421
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Professor Agni!

422
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Leon!

423
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Where are you going?

424
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Leon, don't let him get away

425
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Leon!

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Agni!

427
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hi, Professor

428
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:18,000
We can do it!

429
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You stay here

430
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'll meet Professor Agni

431
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But we're going to join the army, right?

432
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We're going to join the army, right?

433
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We miss the army

434
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
How dare you to fight me?

435
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Huh?

436
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You don't want to listen to me?

437
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You don't want to obey me?

438
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You're a coward

439
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You're a coward, you're a slave hunter

440
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What are you doing?

441
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Why are we doing this?

442
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We're a soldier

443
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let me go, soldier

444
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't you dare to fight me

445
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You're a bad soldier

446
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You protect them, don't let them go

447
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If one of them is released

448
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Then you're a bad person

449
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll make you two

450
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll change you

451
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We're going to fight them

452
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Help!

453
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes!

454
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Hold the rope

455
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Why are you helping me?

456
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Of course, sir

457
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We're your friends

458
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Why are you guys dropping me?

459
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You should drop Alfa

460
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Alfa is our enemy

461
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We're Alfa's friends

462
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So we won't hurt Alfa

463
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You're our enemy

464
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You guys are

465
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The 8th Pangeran's followers

466
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Kailan is my team

467
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We're aware

468
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We won't be hypnotized anymore

469
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We won't be affected by your emotions

470
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And we won't be with you

471
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You're stupid

472
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You're not allowed to be with the 8th Pangeran

473
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That's noisy

474
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
[The 8th Pangeran]

475
00:30:44,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Leon!

476
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You're so slow!

477
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
[The 8th Pangeran]

478
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Agni betrayed me

479
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
[The 8th Pangeran]

480
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
He made me work to free your grandfather

481
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But he poisoned your grandfather

482
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And he even killed his friend

483
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
His name is Adeb Lara

484
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Leon, you're wrong

485
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Your grandfather is still alive

486
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
He's still alive

487
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
He even told me

488
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
To find you

489
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And save you from the 8th Pangeran

490
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Come on, Leon

491
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Come

492
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Come with us

493
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Leave the 8th Pangeran

494
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I really don't know who's right

495
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Grandfather

496
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I need you

497
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
[The 8th Pangeran]

498
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What happened to him?

499
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He's under the influence of the magic

500
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's been a while

501
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
He's still unconscious

502
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What the...

503
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Professor Agni is poisoned

504
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He's being poisoned

505
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Come on, Professor Yasmin

506
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Please stay here

507
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I want to go back to my room

508
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yes, Professor

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
[The 8th Pangeran]

510
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Why hasn't Leon lit the fire?

511
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He should have been in charge of the school

512
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
He's the one who lit the fire

513
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What if I find out the truth?

514
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Okay, sir

515
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You find out the truth

516
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes, sir

517
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh

518
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
What else, sir?

519
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You're a hamster now

520
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, right

521
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I forgot, sir

522
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm happy

523
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You're back to normal

524
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yes, sir

525
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We're happy too

526
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But please forgive me about yesterday

527
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Please forgive us, sir

528
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I've already forgiven you

529
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's not your fault

530
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's Leon's fault

531
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You're under the influence of Leon's magic

532
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes, he's so evil

533
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He's not evil

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
He's just under the influence of the 8th Pangeran

535
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Soldiers!

536
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Enough!

537
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let go of him

538
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Or else,

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'll make your body smell bad

540
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Are you okay, soldier?

541
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You're the one who's sick

542
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You're so mean to us, soldier

543
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You're so bad

544
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I just came here to play with you

545
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm not a bully

546
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm a bully, okay?

547
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Soldier, what do you want?

548
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Don't touch me

549
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Soldier,

550
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You're so mean

551
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Why are you acting like a girl?

552
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Soldier,

553
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You're so mean to a girl

554
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You're such a big kid

555
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You're talking nonsense

556
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You said I'm a bully

557
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
As you know,

558
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
This is the briefcase I'm using

559
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Not yours

560
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Then, what's that?

561
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's none of your business

562
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What are you doing?

563
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You're so nosy

564
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You're so mean

565
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Now,

566
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I want to ask you

567
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Where's professor Alibaran?

568
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I want to meet him

569
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
He's taking care of professor Agni

570
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Who's fainted

571
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What?

572
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Professor Agni

573
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Fainted?

574
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm surprised by this school

575
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
A teacher who easily fainted

576
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And became weak

577
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Is still being used as a teacher

578
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Enough

579
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I want to go

580
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't want to talk to you

581
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I want to find professor Alibaran

582
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Why are you so mean?

583
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay, calm down

584
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Don't think about it

585
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'll go to the toilet

586

I'm scared

587
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I can't just stay still

588

589

590

597

There must be a lot of people there

598
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Where are we going?

599
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We're going to take a ticket

600
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
What?

601
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I know

602

What?

603
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We have to jump together

604
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's a good idea

605
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let's try

606
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000

607
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That's my idea

608
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Let's do it again

Come on

613
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
One more time

Ready?

616

There's a fire!

617

It's so quiet here

623

[The school is so noisy]

626

This school is so noisy

627
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Is there a rat in this school?

628
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What kind of school is this?

629
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The rat trap

630
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Why is there a trap here?

631

[The rat is following me]

632
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Why am I being followed?

633

[I'm safe]

635
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Leon, how was it?

636
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Did you beat all the teachers in this school?

637
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I did!

638
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Leon, you're a great kid

639
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You're so cool

640
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I want to give you a present

How dare you to play with me?

650
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Take this!

I don't have enough energy

658
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think this is because I got hurt

766
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Where's Professor Aldebaran?

767
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I don't know where Professor Aldebaran is

768
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
How can you not know where Aldebaran is?

769
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You meet him every day

770
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Where is he? Tell me

771
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I don't know!

772
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
You're so arrogant!

773
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Just answer me!

774
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Beautiful, amazing!

775
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Why are you so rude?

776
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You're getting more and more arrogant every day

777
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I asked you nicely, where's Aldebaran?

778
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You answered me like that

779
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Where's Aldebaran?

780
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Don't talk nonsense!

781
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm Megantara, the fearless warrior!

782
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He's so cute

783
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
He's like a little baby

784
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It's better to sleep there

785
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Than to be with a boy like him

786
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Welcome, Dark Prince

787
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Anggara, Leon, and all of you

788
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'm so happy

789
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Our plan is a success

790
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Who's first?

791
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Leon, and Professor Anggara

792
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And we are Rion's team!

793
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Good, good

794
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Why is Alfa here?

795
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Sir, all the teachers at Sir's school have given up on me

796
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Even Alfa is now your follower

797
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Finally, Aldebaran is bowing to you

798
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And soon, Alfa will be mine too

799
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You're the one who will bow to the Dark Prince

800
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Sir, to celebrate our success

801
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Please drink this

802
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
What is this?

803
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That's a herbal tea, Sir

804
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
For our body to be healthy and strong

805
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
We have to drink herbal tea

806
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm sorry, Sir

807
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Herbal tea

808
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Okay, then drink it

809
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Why, Sir?

810
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm not ashamed

811
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
After drinking this herbal tea

812
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I fell asleep

813
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Who knows

814
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
There's something weird about this herbal tea

815
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Okay, Sir

816
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:44,000
How is it, Anggara?

817
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
The herbal tea is good, Sir

818
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
If it's good, why did you drink it all?

819
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You should have left some for me

820
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm sorry, Sir

821
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Because it's already good, Sir

822
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:07,000
What is this?

823
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Why is it so bitter?

824
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Get out of here, Prince!

825
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Drink this water, so it won't be bitter anymore

826
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I'm thirsty

827
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Don't look for it!

828
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's bitter

829
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Don't look for it!

830
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
With this, you won't be able to drink it anymore

831
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
We did it!

832
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yes!

833
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Alphon!

834
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Girls, we did it!

835
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yes!

836
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Agni, wait

837
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
You attacked me?

838
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Just attack me!

839
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm not afraid

840
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Attack!

841
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Attack, Alphon!

842
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:20,000
We can do it

843
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Virgo?

844
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Where are you from, Virgo?

845
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
What is this?

846
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Ankara has been successfully captured by Alphon

847
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Good

848
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That's good

849
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm a soldier now

850
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Good

851
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That's good

852
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm a soldier now

853
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Because I'm sure that after this, no one will come to my house

854
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Thank you, Virgo

855
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:22,000
What now?

856
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I'll tie it with a rope

857
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Sir, don't

858
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Not yet

859
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Because if you tie it with a normal rope

860
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
The monster will be able to escape

861
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It's very strong

862
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then what do we use?

863
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I have a mantra that can make the rope stronger

864
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And I'm sure that the monster won't be able to escape

865
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
That's easy

866
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Ravantai Kufu Cin

867
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,000
What should we do?

868
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You're wrong to say the mantra

869
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Okay, I'll say the mantra

870
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Viva

871
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Ravantai Kufu Cin

872
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,000
If we use this rope, the monster won't be able to escape

873
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
But if we tie it, it will be very easy to free it

874
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Viva Kufu Cin

875
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Amazing

876
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Professor Agnita finally realized

877
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Yes, Professor Agnita

878
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Where is she?

879
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Professor Agnita is at the clinic

880
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Perthiwi Beauty Food, amazing

881
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Professor Agnita fainted after fighting Leon

882
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Then?

883
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Where is the other one?

884
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Professor Agnita and Alpha Prime are fighting the villain

885
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The villain is the Darkness Lord

886
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
The Dark Lord?

887
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yes, the Darkness Lord

888
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I have to help him now

889
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Help the Darkness Lord?

890
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Perthiwi is hearing it wrong

891
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Or Professor Agnita is freaking out?

892
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
This is dangerous

893
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
There must be something

894
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The Dark Lord is coming

895
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I think the voice is coming from this direction

896
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But why is there still a follower?

897
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Isn't Ankara defeated by Alpha?

898
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Professor Lebar

899
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I have an idea

900
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Professor Yasmin and I have an agreement

901
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
What if the Dark Lord is imprisoned in the backwoods of the school?

902
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Prison?

903
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Don't worry about the Dark Lord

904
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I can handle it

905
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
There is also a truth

906
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Why Ankara?

907
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Then?

908
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Is there a better idea?

909
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Wait

910
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I'll think about it

911
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Professor Agni?

912
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
He has recovered?

913
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
What is this?

914
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Why are you all defending the respected Dark Lord?

915
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
The Dark Lord?

916
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So that's the Dark Lord

917
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
There's another Dark Lord

918
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But I won't give up

919
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I have to defeat them

920
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Let's go

921
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Let's fight together

922
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
[The Dark Lord is coming]

923
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Who dares to do this?

924
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Stop!

925
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
The Dark Lord is evil

926
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
He's supposed to be in prison

927
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So he can't make snakes anymore

928
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
No, I disagree

929
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
You all have to free the Dark Lord

930
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Not in a chain like that

931
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Professor Agni, why is the Professor missing?

932
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yes

933
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Professor Agni has been acting weird

934
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
What did you say?

935
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm not weird

936
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I'm not

937
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You all

938
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's true

939
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
You shouldn't have done that to the Dark Lord

940
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
What about the other one?

941
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Free the Dark Lord in a chain

942
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Agni!

943
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Professor Agni!

944
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Professor, where are you taking him?

945
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Professor, you're acting weird

946
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yes, Professor, don't do that

947
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Yes, Professor

948
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Free the weapon

949
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Professor Agni

950
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Defeat the lollipop

951
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
The blue one

952
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Professor, the blue one

953
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Professor Agni

954
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Agni, wait

955
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
You want to attack me?

956
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Go ahead

957
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm not afraid

958
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Attack!

959
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Professor, wait!

960
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Professor Agni!

961
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Guys, let's go after him

962
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Let's go

963
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Professor, wait!

964
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Let me go!

965
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Guys

966
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Let's go after him

967
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Let's go

968
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I managed to get away from them

969
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Agni is defeated

970
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
They will lose

971
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I'm really hungry

972
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Now I got a professor from Syri's school

973
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:57,000
We can do it

974
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Why is Professor Agni acting weird?

975
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Since he realized Ramon is from Leon

976
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Agni must be possessed by Ramon Hijau

977
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Ramon Hijau

978
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
What Ramon, Professor?

979
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It's a super quality Ramon

980
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Super quality Ramon?

981
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
What does it mean, Professor?

982
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I've heard about Ramon

983
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's not really different from the Ramon you made

984
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
But it's a far more powerful version

985
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So Ramon made Professor Agni become a god

986
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And praise the dark side?

987
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yes

988
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
That's right, Professor

989
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I'm going to talk to him

990
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I want to know what you want

991
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:49,000
He ran away so fast

992
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
He even followed us with his eyes

993
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Who is he?

994
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm going to talk to him

995
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
He's gone

996
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Where did he go?

997
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:18,000
There he is

998
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Why am I here?

999
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Who brought you here?

1000
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I brought you here

1001
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Why are you in my bed?

1002
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's been a long time, Sir

1003
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
We haven't met

1004
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
You

1005
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Where are your friends?

1006
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
What do you want?

1007
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You

1008
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
You want to challenge me?

1009
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Right?

1010
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Let's go

1011
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I'm ready to fight you

1012
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Don't be mad at me

1013
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Okay?

1014
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Don't joke around

1015
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I'm serious

1016
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Who's joking?

1017
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Agni

1018
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Look at your left hand

1019
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,000
There's a mark

1020
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It means

1021
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Agni has been hit by a green light

1022
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It seems

1023
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You've been hit by my super love potion

1024
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Whatever you say, Sir

1025
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
What's clear is

1026
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I'm ready to fight you

1027
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I'm so proud

1028
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Now I have a professor from Siri School

1029
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Professor?

1030
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Yes

1031
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
How do we make Professor Agni realize?

1032
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That's right, that's right

1033
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Of course with his offer

1034
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'll make it happen

1035
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I've promised him

1036
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
No

1037
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
This offer must be given a special gift

1038
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Special?

1039
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
What's that?

1040
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
The offer must be added with the dark magic

1041
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It's scary

1042
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't want to be a baby

1043
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
What should we do?

1044
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
The dark magic has gone

1045
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Just leave it to me, Sir

1046
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I'll get it

1047
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So you'll find the dark magic

1048
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And give it to me?

1049
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Yes, Sir

1050
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Just wait for me

1051
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Guys, help our friend

1052
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Bro, help our friend

1053
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Agni, how can you do that?

1054
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It's all because of the soldiers

1055
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
The soldiers did this to us

1056
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Sir, don't write it like that

1057
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You got it wrong

1058
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I'll finish you

1059
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So you can't go back to school

1060
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And tell Alfa and Alipa

1061
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Ready

1062
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Show your spirit, get ready

1063
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Find your friends

1064
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Run, jump, jump

1065
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Reach the stars

1066
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Be brave

1067
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Don't give up

1068
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

1069
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Go, go, go

1070
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Achieve all your dreams

1071
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Go, go, go

1072
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Never stop

1073
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Go, go, go

1074
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Fight with your heart

1075
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Go, go, go

1076
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Make yourself proud

1077
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Go, go, go

1078
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Let's dream

1079
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Go, go, go

1080
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
We'll make it
