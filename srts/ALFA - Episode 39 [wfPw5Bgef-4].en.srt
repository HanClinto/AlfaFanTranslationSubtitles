1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 To be continued...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 To be continued...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 To be continued...

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 To be continued...

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, prepare your friends

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the tower

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, struggle with your heart

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Is there any need for me to leave?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 This is about the lost compass

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 The compass is very similar to the ring used by Afyuta

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 If this ring is really a stone of soul, we have to destroy this ring

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Even if I have to die, I'm willing to do it

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 As long as I can destroy the darkness

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I want to tell you that I know where your compass is

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 If you really know, where?

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Aldebaran, the leader of the magic school

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Your compass is there

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Finish!

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Now Aldebaran has been caught

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Hahaha

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Hahaha

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It seems you have realized where you are

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Let me go, let me go

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Let go

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Calm down Aldebaran

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I will definitely let you go

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 But you are far from my question

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Where is the stone of the compass?

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Hahaha

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I have guessed

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 You will definitely be silent

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I will find out for myself, Aldebaran

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Hahaha

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Havadjur!

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Havadjur!

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Why is it so strong?

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 The stone of the compass is in the hand of Aldebaran

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Your Highness

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Now I have caught your favorite professor

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Professor Aldebaran

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 If you want me to release Professor Aldebaran

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It's up to you

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Don't argue with me

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Don't argue?

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 We don't know anything about it

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Why are you looking for us?

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Hahaha

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Maybe you don't know

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 So you should ask

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Alva or Professor Purno

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 The eighth day

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Why?

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 We have to ask Alva and Purno

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It seems that Alva knows

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Because Alva and her friends

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Have come to my room with Professor Aldebaran

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 To ask about the stone of the compass

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 If so

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Let me be the first to go to the eighth day

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Draft of paper and pen

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Professor Purno

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Professor Aldebaran has been caught by the eighth day

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And the only way to save him

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Is by giving the stone of the compass to the eighth day

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Find Professor Purno

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And give the paper to him

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 What is that, professor?

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 From Professor Rahmi

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 What are you going to do, professor?

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Professor Aldebaran has been caught by the eighth day

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And the only way to save him

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Is by giving the stone of the compass to the eighth day

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 You see now, right?

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Purno, you see now, right?

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 This is the result

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And this is now Professor Aldebaran

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Who's next?

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 This could be dangerous for everyone

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Akhila

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Professor Aldebaran is strong

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He can definitely pass this

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 You just calm down

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Yes, professor Aldebaran has a high level

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So, professor Aldebaran can definitely pass, aunt

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 You just calm down

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 No, aunt

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Don't worry

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Enough!

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Alva

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Mom, it's true

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 You can't go to the eighth day

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I have to give the stone to him

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Are you sure, mom?

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Yes

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Mom, we have to apologize first

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Because I need a life, right?

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I'm proud of you, son

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 You have made the right decision

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Let's go, everyone

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Let's go

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Purno

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You're here

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I've been looking for you everywhere

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I'm so worried

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Alva

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I understand

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 This is so hard for you

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 You don't want to be apart from your mother

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I know

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But in a time like this

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 You have to be more determined, Alva

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I beg you

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Because this is for our own good

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And I beg you

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Please think about it with a calm mind

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And a pure mind

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 About the world's great master

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I'm late, mom

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I want to go to the toilet

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 You want to go?

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 You've been talking for a while

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Yes

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 You should ask first

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Don't give me a sign

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I'll go there

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I know

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Okay

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Everyone

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Let's go to my house

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And use teleportation

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 One, two, three

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Teleportation

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Teleportation

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So the room you've been hiding

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Is where Gama and Akila live

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You're still alive, Gama

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I want to talk to Alva

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Okay, everyone

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Let's go

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Is there anything I can do for you?

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I'm sorry

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I'm sorry

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 What is it?

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I have a secret, Alva

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I've been keeping it for a long time

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Even though

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Mom and dad are sleeping

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Don't worry, honey

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Because you're not alone

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 You have a sister

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Sister?

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Yes, honey

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Her name is Eduardo

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 She was kidnapped by mom and dad

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 When she was still a baby

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 A year before you were born

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 But I'm sure

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Until now

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Edo is still alive

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But I don't know where he is now

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So I want you to help me

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Find Edo

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Because I'm sure he can help you

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Defeat the Dark Lord

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Okay, mom

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I'll find Edo

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And you know

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Why the Dark Lord can't kill you

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 When you're still a baby

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Because you're the chosen one, Alva

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 It's your destiny

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 If one day

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 You'll grow up to be a great kid

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 With extraordinary power

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And your dad once said

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 If there's a mantra

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 There's a mantra

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 With great power

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 If you chant it

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Your duty

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Your duty now is to find that mantra

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Now wipe your tears

192
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 You have to be strong, Naya

193
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 You can call your friends

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000

 He lost!

408
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 He lost!

409
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Yeah!

410
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Yeah!

411
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 One, two, three!

412
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Three!

413
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Go!

414
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Professor Aldebaran

415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Professor, are you okay?

416
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I'm fine.

417
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Thank you.

418
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You all have helped me.

419
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Professor Aldebaran should thank Alva

420
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 because she has been willing to let go of the ring on her mother's finger.

421
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Thank you, Alva.

422
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I'm so proud of you.

423
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 You have the courage to make the right decision.

424
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Even though I know it's very hard.

425
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You're welcome, Professor.

426
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Okay then.

427
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Now it's time for us to go home.

428
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Yes!

429
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Yes!

430
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Let's go!

431
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Why am I still here?

432
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 What happened?

433
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Janji!

434
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Watch out, all of you!

435
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I will get my revenge!

436
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Especially you, Alva!

437
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Angkara!

438
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Angkara!

439
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Oh, right.

440
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I forgot.

441
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Angkara is still in the prison at the magic school.

442
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I have to get all the soul stones.

443
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And I have to keep it safe.

444
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And I also have to be able to destroy the Kurnaba Sword

445
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 so that Alva can't destroy my soul stones again.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Telur!

447
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Now I'm going to assign you to find the fourth soul stone.

448
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And the fourth soul stone is shaped like a sunflower seed.

449
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Find it right now.

450
00:26:41,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Can we make a surprise for Alva?

451
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Sure.

452
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Let's go!

453
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Who are you?

454
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Let's go!

455
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Girls, today we're going to plant the sunflower seeds.

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 This flower will be very beautiful.

457
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Yippee!

458
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 When this flower is big, it will be the strongest flower

459
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 that can't be destroyed by evil hands and face.

460
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Yippee!

461
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 What's that?

462
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Girls, that's a unicorn!

463
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Unicorn!

464
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 It's so cute!

465
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 It's so beautiful!

466
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Hurry up!

467
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Let's go to the infirmary!

468
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Oh no!

469
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 The unicorn is very strong.

470
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 We should leave here.

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Help!

472
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Find the angel fruit.

473
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Angel fruit?

474
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 This fruit is small but it has power.

475
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 We can do it!

476
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 We can do it!

477
00:29:48,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Where are you taking me?

478
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 I know where you're taking me.

479
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 I'm going to the infirmary.

480
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 I'll be waiting for you there.

481
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I'll be waiting for you there.

482
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 One, two, three!

483
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Happy birthday to you!

484
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Happy birthday to you!

485
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Happy birthday to you!

486
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Happy birthday to you!

487
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 We'll pray for you.

488
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Happy birthday to you!

489
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Happy birthday to you!

490
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Happy birthday to you!

491
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And be happy!

492
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Happy birthday!

493
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 It's time for the birthday song.

494
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Let's make a wish.

495
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Make a wish, Alpha.

496
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Happy birthday to you!

497
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Happy birthday to you!

498
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Happy birthday to you!

499
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Happy birthday to you!

500
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I'm scared!

501
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 It's a snake!

502
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Help!

503
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Let me do it.

504
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 They don't like men.

505
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 They don't like men.

506
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 What's wrong with you?

507
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Our village was attacked.

508
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Our village was destroyed.

509
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 A snake.

510
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 A snake.

511
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 What snake?

512
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 A snake.

513
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 A snake.

514
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 I'll take you to the hospital.

515
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Oh, no, Prof.

516
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 This is serious, Prof.

517
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 I'm not possessed, Prof.

518
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 It's because of the fight.

519
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 If so, you should cure them all.

520
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 That's right, Prof.

521
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 The cure is a bit difficult.

522
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 What is the cure?

523
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 The cure is Fruit Angel.

524
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Or Fruit Angel.

525
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 That's what can cure them, Prof.

526
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 But, you know what?

527
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Fruit Angel's cure is in a magical tree.

528
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 In the forbidden forest.

529
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Amazing, right, Prof?

530
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Kids.

531
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 I have an important task for you.

532
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 What is it, Prof?

533
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Find Fruit Angel.

534
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Fruit Angel?

535
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 This fruit is small.

536
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 But it has wings.

537
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 This fruit is in a magical tree.

538
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 In the forbidden forest.

539
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Kids.

540
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 You don't have to be afraid.

541
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Because, while you're looking for Fruit Angel,

542
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 you'll be accompanied by the professors.

543
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 The team that finds Fruit Angel first...

544
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 should inform the other team.

545
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 So, they can help each other.

546
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Because the number of Fruit Angel that you have to take...

547
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 is eight.

548
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 If you're sure, you should leave as soon as possible.

549
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Yes, Prof.

550
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Everyone, get ready.

551
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 On the count of three.

552
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 One.

553
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Two.

554
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Three.

555
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Three.

556
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Three.

557
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 You're here, Ndiko.

558
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 I accept your formality.

559
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 So?

560
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 You've got the limit of your eyes.

561
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Good, Ndiko.

562
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Good.

563
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 If I give you a chance,

564
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 you'll get zero.

565
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Now.

566
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 The flower of the sun.

567
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I'll give you a chance.

568
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 To be a strong flower tree.

569
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And...

570
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 The flower tree won't be destroyed by you.

571
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Pay me back.

572
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 You've invited me, Ndiko.

573
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Alright.

574
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Please, go.

575
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Now.

576
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 It's time for you to face the truth.

577
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Oh, look, Teng Dara.

578
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 The moon is getting darker.

579
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Yes, it's getting scarier.

580
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 Teng Dara.

581
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Yes, we're scared, Teng Dara.

582
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 You're...

583
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Witches.

584
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Witch school kids.

585
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 How come?

586
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 You're scared of the forest?

587
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 How come?

588
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 It's scary, Teng Dara.

589
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 It's getting darker.

590
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 What's the devil doing?

591
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Come on.

592
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Keep going.

593
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Be brave.

594
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Ouch.

595
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Ouch.

596
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 What's that?

597
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 What's wrong?

598
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Ouch, Teng Dara.

599
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 I got a toothache.

600
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Come on, Jack.

601
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Who is it?

602
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 It's Tommy.

603
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 I'll go first.

604
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 See you, Teng Dara.

605
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 What's wrong?

606
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 How come he got a toothache?

607
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 That's weird.

608
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Ouch.

609
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 My hand hurts.

610
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Ouch.

611
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 It hurts.

612
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Ouch.

613
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 I'm getting a toothache.

614
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 It's getting darker.

615
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 He's calling us.

616
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Let's go there.

617
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Teleportation.

618
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Mr. Jiran, please.

619
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Mr. Jiran, please.

620
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Who will be your teacher?

621
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 You'll get a task...

622
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 ...that will be done by the police.

623
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Okay, sir.

624
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Yes, sir.

625
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 We can do it.

626
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 We can do it.

627
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 Now, we'll do it according to the rules.

628
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Are you ready?

629
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Yes, sir.

630
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Yasmin.

631
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 What's wrong? Why are you back?

632
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 You're not supposed to be leading the kids.

633
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 To find their fruit.

634
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 I'm sorry, sir.

635
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 I had to come back.

636
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Because I got a clue from the stars in the sky.

637
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 The soul stone is in the village of Gadis Angsa.

638
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Is this related to the attack by the Angsa girls?

639
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 I think so, sir.

640
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 You should leave this place.

641
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 Because the dark lord is more alert now.

642
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Because he wants to find the stone.

643
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Okay, I'll leave now.

644
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 When the kids are back from finding the fruit,

645
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 please tell me where it is.

646
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Yes, sir.

647
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 (The Dark Lord)

648
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 What's the matter, Professor Aldebaran?

649
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 You should go back to school now.

650
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 I need your help.

651
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 What about the problem of finding the angel fruit?

652
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 I can do it myself.

653
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 Isn't that right, Panji?

654
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Of course, Professor.

655
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Okay, I'll wait for you at the school.

656
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 I'll leave now.

657
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Okay, sir.

658
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 What's the matter?

659
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Where is the angel fruit?

660
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 What's the matter, sir?

661
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Thank you for coming.

662
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Yes, sir.

663
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Now you have to accompany me to find the angel fruit.

664
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Are you ready?

665
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Yes, sir.

666
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Okay, let's go.

667
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Yes, sir.

668
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 To the ground!

669
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 (The Dark Lord)

670
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Keep looking, kids.

671
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 There's only one angel fruit tree in this forest.

672
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 What does it look like?

673
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 If you see it, you'll know.

674
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 The angel fruit tree has a very small fruit,

675
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 like this.

676
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 But it has wings and can fly.

677
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Come on, keep looking.

678
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 (The Dark Lord)

679
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 (The Dark Lord)

680
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 The angel fruit tree! Leon!

681
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 Leon, the angel fruit tree!

682
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Guys, come here!

683
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 What is it?

684
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Professor, there's a path.

685
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 That's right.

686
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 The wings are flying.

687
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Good, Alva.

688
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 That's the angel fruit tree.

689
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 Let's call the others.

690
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Firewall!

691
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 (The Dark Lord)

692
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 (The Dark Lord)

693
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 Kids, look at that.

694
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 (The Dark Lord)

695
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 That's a sign that if there's a shadow between us,

696
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 someone will get the angel fruit.

697
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 We have to go there.

698
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Yes, sir.

699
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Let's use teleportation spell.

700
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 On the count of three.

701
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 One, two, three.

702
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Teleportation!

703
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Wow, it's so shiny.

704
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 It's like a new year.

705
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 That means,

706
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 they have found the angel fruit.

707
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 Now, let's teleport.

708
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 On the count of three.

709
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Okay?

710
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 One, two, three.

711
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 Teleportation!

712
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 What are you doing here?

713
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 We're in trouble.

714
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 Professor Lali Baran asked us to move the guards.

715
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Don't be ridiculous.

716
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 I didn't get any order from Professor Aldebaran.

717
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 Professor Aldebaran is looking for the stone of soul.

718
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 That's why he asked us to move Professor Ankara.

719
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 And all the professors in the school are looking for the medicine in the forest.

720
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Hurry up, sir. We don't have much time.

721
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 We have to do it now.

722
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Before all the mess gets here,

723
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 we have to move Professor Ankara immediately.

724
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 Yes, sir. We have to hurry.

725
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Before everything gets more difficult.

726
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Okay.

727
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 You guys stay in front of the cell door.

728
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 As soon as the door is opened,

729
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 you guys keep the guards safe.

730
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Don't let them go.

731
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 If you let them go,

732
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 they can turn into hamsters.

733
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Let's go.

734
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Follow us.

735
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 What's going on?

736
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Come on, Ankara.

737
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Come on, follow us.

738
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 Soon, you'll be free, Ankara.

739
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 To be continued...

740
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 To be continued...

741
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 Professor Agni.

742
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 Professor Tidak.

743
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 I'm glad you're here.

744
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Yes, Professor.

745
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 As soon as we see the fire,

746
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 we'll come here.

747
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 I'm glad too, Purwa.

748
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Where's the others?

749
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 Where are you going?

750
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 My eyes.

751
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Ouch.

752
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 You guys.

753
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 How long are you going to use teleportation?

754
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 I'm sorry.

755
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 Anci.

756
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Where are Nick and his friends?

757
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 You're not responsible.

758
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 You must have left them.

759
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Right?

760
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 What?

761
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 You're so reckless, Purwa.

762
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 They're back to school.

763
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
