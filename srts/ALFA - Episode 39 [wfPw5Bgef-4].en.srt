1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, prepare your friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, struggle with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is there any need for me to leave?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is about the lost compass

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The compass is very similar to the ring used by Afyuta

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If this ring is really a stone of soul, we have to destroy this ring

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Even if I have to die, I'm willing to do it

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As long as I can destroy the darkness

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to tell you that I know where your compass is

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you really know, where?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Aldebaran, the leader of the magic school

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your compass is there

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Finish!

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now Aldebaran has been caught

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hahaha

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It seems you have realized where you are

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let me go, let me go

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let go

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Calm down Aldebaran

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will definitely let you go

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But you are far from my question

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where is the stone of the compass?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hahaha

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have guessed

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You will definitely be silent

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will find out for myself, Aldebaran

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hahaha

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Havadjur!

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why is it so strong?

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The stone of the compass is in the hand of Aldebaran

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Your Highness

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now I have caught your favorite professor

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Professor Aldebaran

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you want me to release Professor Aldebaran

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's up to you

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't argue with me

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't argue?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We don't know anything about it

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why are you looking for us?

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hahaha

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Maybe you don't know

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So you should ask

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Alva or Professor Purno

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The eighth day

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why?

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We have to ask Alva and Purno

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It seems that Alva knows

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Because Alva and her friends

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Have come to my room with Professor Aldebaran

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
To ask about the stone of the compass

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If so

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let me be the first to go to the eighth day

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Draft of paper and pen

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Professor Purno

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Professor Aldebaran has been caught by the eighth day

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And the only way to save him

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is by giving the stone of the compass to the eighth day

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Find Professor Purno

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And give the paper to him

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What is that, professor?

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
From Professor Rahmi

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you going to do, professor?

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Professor Aldebaran has been caught by the eighth day

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And the only way to save him

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Is by giving the stone of the compass to the eighth day

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You see now, right?

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Purno, you see now, right?

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is the result

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And this is now Professor Aldebaran

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Who's next?

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This could be dangerous for everyone

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Akhila

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Professor Aldebaran is strong

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He can definitely pass this

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You just calm down

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, professor Aldebaran has a high level

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, professor Aldebaran can definitely pass, aunt

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You just calm down

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, aunt

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't worry

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Enough!

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Alva

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mom, it's true

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can't go to the eighth day

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have to give the stone to him

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you sure, mom?

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mom, we have to apologize first

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because I need a life, right?

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm proud of you, son

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have made the right decision

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's go, everyone

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Purno

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're here

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've been looking for you everywhere

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm so worried

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Alva

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I understand

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is so hard for you

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You don't want to be apart from your mother

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I know

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But in a time like this

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You have to be more determined, Alva

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I beg you

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because this is for our own good

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And I beg you

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Please think about it with a calm mind

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And a pure mind

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
About the world's great master

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm late, mom

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I want to go to the toilet

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You want to go?

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You've been talking for a while

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You should ask first

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't give me a sign

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll go there

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I know

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Everyone

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go to my house

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And use teleportation

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
One, two, three

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Teleportation

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So the room you've been hiding

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is where Gama and Akila live

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're still alive, Gama

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I want to talk to Alva

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay, everyone

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's go

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Is there anything I can do for you?

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What is it?

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I have a secret, Alva

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I've been keeping it for a long time

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Even though

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mom and dad are sleeping

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't worry, honey

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because you're not alone

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You have a sister

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sister?

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes, honey

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Her name is Eduardo

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She was kidnapped by mom and dad

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When she was still a baby

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
A year before you were born

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But I'm sure

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Until now

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Edo is still alive

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But I don't know where he is now

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So I want you to help me

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Find Edo

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Because I'm sure he can help you

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Defeat the Dark Lord

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, mom

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll find Edo

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And you know

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why the Dark Lord can't kill you

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
When you're still a baby

171
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Because you're the chosen one, Alva

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's your destiny

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If one day

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You'll grow up to be a great kid

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
With extraordinary power

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And your dad once said

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
If there's a mantra

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There's a mantra

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
With great power

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you chant it

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Your duty

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Your duty now is to find that mantra

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Now wipe your tears

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You have to be strong, Naya

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can call your friends

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, mom

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mom

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm Purwa

189
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm Alva

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Please take care of Alva

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm Purwa

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Purwa

193
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
[The End]

194

What if we find the dark wizard's son?

229

We should tell him that he's the one who should be the one to help us

230

And then we should tell him that he should forgive us

Alfa, why didn't it work?

237

According to the prof's law, if we destroy it now,

238
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
the dark side will be angry,

239
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000

383
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Kids.

384
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You don't have to be afraid.

385
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Because, while you're looking for Fruit Angel,

386
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
you'll be accompanied by the professors.

387
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The team that finds Fruit Angel first...

388
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
should inform the other team.

389
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So, they can help each other.

390
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Because the number of Fruit Angel that you have to take...

391
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
is eight.

392
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If you're sure, you should leave as soon as possible.

393
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yes, Prof.

394
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Everyone, get ready.

395
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
On the count of three.

396
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
One.

397
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Two.

398
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Three.

399
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You're here, Ndiko.

400
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I accept your formality.

401
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So?

402
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You've got the limit of your eyes.

403
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Good, Ndiko.

404
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Good.

405
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
If I give you a chance,

406
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
you'll get zero.

407
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Now.

408
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The flower of the sun.

409
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll give you a chance.

410
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
To be a strong flower tree.

411
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And...

412
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The flower tree won't be destroyed by you.

413
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Pay me back.

414
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You've invited me, Ndiko.

415
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Alright.

416
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Please, go.

417
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Now.

418
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's time for you to face the truth.

419
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh, look, Teng Dara.

420
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The moon is getting darker.

421
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yes, it's getting scarier.

422
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Teng Dara.

423
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yes, we're scared, Teng Dara.

424
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You're...

425
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Witches.

426
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Witch school kids.

427
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
How come?

428
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You're scared of the forest?

429
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
How come?

430
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's scary, Teng Dara.

431
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's getting darker.

432
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What's the devil doing?

433
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Come on.

434
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Keep going.

435
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Be brave.

436
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Ouch.

437
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What's that?

438
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
What's wrong?

439
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Ouch, Teng Dara.

440
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I got a toothache.

441
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Come on, Jack.

442
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Who is it?

443
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's Tommy.

444
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'll go first.

445
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
See you, Teng Dara.

446
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What's wrong?

447
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
How come he got a toothache?

448
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
That's weird.

449
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Ouch.

450
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
My hand hurts.

451
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Ouch.

452
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It hurts.

453
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Ouch.

454
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm getting a toothache.

455
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's getting darker.

456
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
He's calling us.

457
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Let's go there.

458
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Teleportation.

459
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Mr. Jiran, please.

460
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Who will be your teacher?

461
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You'll get a task...

462
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
...that will be done by the police.

463
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay, sir.

464
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes, sir.

465
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We can do it.

466
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Now, we'll do it according to the rules.

467
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Are you ready?

468
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yes, sir.

469
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yasmin.

470
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
What's wrong? Why are you back?

471
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You're not supposed to be leading the kids.

472
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
To find their fruit.

473
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm sorry, sir.

474
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I had to come back.

475
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Because I got a clue from the stars in the sky.

476
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The soul stone is in the village of Gadis Angsa.

477
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Is this related to the attack by the Angsa girls?

478
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I think so, sir.

479
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You should leave this place.

480
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Because the dark lord is more alert now.

481
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Because he wants to find the stone.

482
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay, I'll leave now.

483
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
When the kids are back from finding the fruit,

484
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
please tell me where it is.

485
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes, sir.

486
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
(The Dark Lord)

487
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What's the matter, Professor Aldebaran?

488
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You should go back to school now.

489
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I need your help.

490
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What about the problem of finding the angel fruit?

491
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I can do it myself.

492
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Isn't that right, Panji?

493
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Of course, Professor.

494
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay, I'll wait for you at the school.

495
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'll leave now.

496
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Okay, sir.

497
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:53,000
What's the matter?

498
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Where is the angel fruit?

499
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What's the matter, sir?

500
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Thank you for coming.

501
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes, sir.

502
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Now you have to accompany me to find the angel fruit.

503
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Are you ready?

504
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yes, sir.

505
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Okay, let's go.

506
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yes, sir.

507
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:30,000
To the ground!

508
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
(The Dark Lord)

509
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Keep looking, kids.

510
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
There's only one angel fruit tree in this forest.

511
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What does it look like?

512
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
If you see it, you'll know.

513
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The angel fruit tree has a very small fruit,

514
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
like this.

515
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But it has wings and can fly.

516
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Come on, keep looking.

517
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
(The Dark Lord)

518
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The angel fruit tree! Leon!

519
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Leon, the angel fruit tree!

520
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Guys, come here!

521
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
What is it?

522
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Professor, there's a path.

523
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's right.

524
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The wings are flying.

525
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Good, Alva.

526
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That's the angel fruit tree.

527
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Let's call the others.

528
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Firewall!

529
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:39,000
(The Dark Lord)

530
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Kids, look at that.

531
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
(The Dark Lord)

532
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That's a sign that if there's a shadow between us,

533
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
someone will get the angel fruit.

534
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
We have to go there.

535
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yes, sir.

536
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Let's use teleportation spell.

537
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
On the count of three.

538
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
One, two, three.

539
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Teleportation!

540
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Wow, it's so shiny.

541
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's like a new year.

542
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That means,

543
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
they have found the angel fruit.

544
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Now, let's teleport.

545
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
On the count of three.

546
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Okay?

547
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
One, two, three.

548
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Teleportation!

549
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
What are you doing here?

550
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We're in trouble.

551
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Professor Lali Baran asked us to move the guards.

552
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Don't be ridiculous.

553
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I didn't get any order from Professor Aldebaran.

554
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Professor Aldebaran is looking for the stone of soul.

555
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That's why he asked us to move Professor Ankara.

556
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And all the professors in the school are looking for the medicine in the forest.

557
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Hurry up, sir. We don't have much time.

558
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
We have to do it now.

559
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Before all the mess gets here,

560
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
we have to move Professor Ankara immediately.

561
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yes, sir. We have to hurry.

562
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Before everything gets more difficult.

563
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Okay.

564
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You guys stay in front of the cell door.

565
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
As soon as the door is opened,

566
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
you guys keep the guards safe.

567
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Don't let them go.

568
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If you let them go,

569
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
they can turn into hamsters.

570
