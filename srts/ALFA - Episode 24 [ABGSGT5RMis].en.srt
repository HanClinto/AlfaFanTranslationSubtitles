 To be continued...

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 To be continued...

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 To be continued...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 To be continued...

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 To be continued...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 When the dark lord attacked you,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 there was a power that appeared in you

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 and made the dark lord furious

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 When he wanted to attack you again,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 he realized that he had lost all his power

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 What do you want, Angkar?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I will grant it

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I want to be the head of the school of magic

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I want to be the head of the school of magic

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 What a coincidence, Angkar

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 That's what you're thinking

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I will allow you to live here

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 but on one condition

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 What condition, sir?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 You have to fight me

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 What?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Fire!

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I will make this school the second head of the school of magic

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Just watch me

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 You will know that I'm better than you

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 The second round

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 One

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Two

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Three

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Four

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Five

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Six

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Seven

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Eight

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Nine

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Ten

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Angkar, you're dead!

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Angkar, you're dead!

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Angkar, you're dead!

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 The soul stone will spread all over the school of magic

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 It's far away, thousands of kilometers

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And it will be rain, thunder, and sand

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Will you be able to go to the school of magic like that?

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Enjoy the last round of the final round

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Because tomorrow, I will be sitting there

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And this room will be my room

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Now, let's welcome the new head of the school

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 The head of the school that we have been waiting for

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 The head of the school of magic that is the most powerful

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Who is he?

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 We will not wait for anyone else

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Professor Angkara!

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Professor Angkara!

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Professor Angkara!

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Professor Angkara!

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Professor Angkara!

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Professor Angkara!

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Professor Angkara!

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 You're all so good!

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Angkara, you're great!

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You deserve to be the head of the school of magic

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Thank you

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I feel like I'm hearing voices

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I feel like I'm hearing voices

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I feel like I'm hearing voices

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I feel like I'm hearing voices

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I feel like I'm hearing voices

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I feel like I'm hearing voices

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Now, the third round

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 The third round!

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 One

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Two

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Three

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Finish it!

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 [The third round]

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I'm going to fall!

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 You said you're going to finish it!

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Wait! Wait!

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 It can't be like that!

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I won the first round

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 That means I won!

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I'm sorry, Professor

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 The decision of the students can't be changed

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 What should we do now?

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I know the way

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Why don't you just tell Alva to finish it?

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 That's a good idea!

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I agree!

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Alva

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 The two of you

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 The one who never gives up

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 If you're angry, she'll always be angry

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Okay?

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 One, two, three!

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 We're still the winners!

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 We're going home

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Okay

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 All of you

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 We're done singing

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'll take my leave

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And the lesson will be continued by Professor Tita

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Professor Agni, Professor Yasmin

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I'll take my leave

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Good afternoon, students!

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Good afternoon, sir!

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Wow!

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 You're all smiling!

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Do you miss Professor Tita?

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Yes, sir!

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Now, before the lesson starts

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 You have to say hello to Professor Tita

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Try to imitate her

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Say "Ahai" with a smile

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Let's try

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Ahai!

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 With a smile!

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 With a smile, too!

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Do you want chocolate?

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Yes, sir!

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Do you want lollipop?

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Yes, sir!

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Okay, I'll give you one

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 With a smile!

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Put your right hand first

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Still okay?

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Here's your prize!

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 A mosquito raincoat!

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Mosquito!

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Ahai!

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 With a smile!

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Very good!

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Now, finish the mosquito!

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Why are we still drinking mosquitoes?

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 We want chocolate and lollipop, not mosquitoes!

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Mosquitoes are not tasty!

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 That's right!

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 You have to go to war

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 So you have to drink mosquitoes

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So you can be strong!

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Not like that, Professor Jasmine

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Professor Agni

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Students, what Professor Tan said is true

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Mosquitoes are very pitiful

155
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So you have to drink them all

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Yes, ma'am!

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Very good!

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Okay, I'm going to drink the mosquito!

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 My students!

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Ahai!

161
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 With a smile!

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Do you feel strong now?

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Yes, sir!

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Now, I'm going to teach you a mantra

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 This mantra is called "Airfang Mantra"

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Here's an example

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Get some airfang!

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 My students, look!

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 At the end of this line, there's water

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 That's the use of airfang mantra

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I'm thirsty! I want to drink water!

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Airfang!

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Me too!

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Airfang!

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 You have to practice seriously

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Don't be silly!

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 You have to face the darkness with spirit

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Don't play around!

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Do you understand?

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Yes, sir!

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Listen to what Professor Agni and Professor Jasmine said

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Now, you have to try it together

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And whoever can get the most water from the end of the line

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Will get a present from me

185
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Okay?

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Let's try it now!

187
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Let's try it!

188
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Airfang Mantra

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Airfang Mantra

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Wow!

191
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Give me a smile!

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Very good!

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 My students, the one who can get the most water from the end of the line

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Is me!

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So, I'll give you a present

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I got a brown one!

197
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Thank you, sir!

198
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 You're welcome, Nick

199
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 How does it taste?

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It's so good, Prof!

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 The brown one is so tasty!

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And it's big inside!

203
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 It's so good, Nick!

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Nick, choose one!

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And for the other students

206
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 If you can do this again

207
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You'll also get a present from the professor

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Do you understand?

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Yes, sir!

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Smart!

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Give me a smile!

212
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 So, students

213
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Are you all ready to be tested?

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 What test, Prof?

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 The bonsai tree is being watered

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 While the fruit is not yet ripe

217
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Hi, students!

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Megantara is here!

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Is there anything we can do for you, Megantara?

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Of course!

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Why are you all here?

222
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Students

223
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 There's a task for you

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 What is it?

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I'm sorry, Megantara

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 But I can't help you with this

227
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 You're the one who's responsible for this

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I'm sorry, Megantara

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But I can't help you with this

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 You're the one who's responsible for this

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 I'm sorry, Megantara

232
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But I can't help you with this

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 You're the one who's responsible for this

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 You're so pretty

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Do you know me?

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I'm Jack

237
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 My name is Tommy

238
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 My name is Mike

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 There's another attack!

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's a boar!

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 It's a boar!

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 It's a boar!

243
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It's a boar!

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 What?

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's a boar!

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Eyes right.

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Come on, fight.

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Find her weak spot.

249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Come on, Benjo.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Where is Anebaran's last card?

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Eyes right.

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Eyes left.

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Eyes right.

254
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Eyes left.

255
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Eyes right.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Eyes left.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Only Nick and three of his friends are alive.

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 How is this?

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Anebaran's last card.

260
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 How can you beat the 8th Prince?

261
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 You've lost to Duyung.

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Megantara.

263
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 It seems like they're not ready.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But, Professor Ado.

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 The Stone of Soul.

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 They have to get it.

267
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Kids.

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Come on.

269
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Use Airfah's spell.

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Airfah.

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Airfah.

272
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 It's Duyung.

273
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 It's Duyung.

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Nick.

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It's Duyung.

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Yes.

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 We did it.

278
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Yes.

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Kids.

280
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 You've succeeded.

281
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 You're accepted.

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Yes.

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Megantara.

284
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 These kids are being tested.

285
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 You shouldn't tell them the answer.

286
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 What are you doing here?

287
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 If other people know, our plan will fail.

288
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I'm sorry, sir.

289
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I'm just checking this room.

290
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Because I'll be in this room soon.

291
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 "The Stone of Soul"

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Help.

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Please help us.

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Don't hurt us.

295
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Whose voice is that?

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Is that the voice?

297
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 That's none of your business.

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 If you feel bothered by that voice,

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 there's a river nearby.

300
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I'm here to pick up the kids.

301
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Not to have fun.

302
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I don't have money to live.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It's not like usual.

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 You're looking for freebies?

305
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 "The Stone of Soul"

306
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Come here.

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 I want to warn you.

308
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Don't tell the others about the stone in that room.

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Let's go.

310
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Why?

311
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I can't trust the others.

312
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Moreover,

313
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 the less people know,

314
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 the better.

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Because if they find out...

316
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 that you and Akulila are still alive,

317
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 he'll come after them.

318
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Who's that?

319
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 I think he's looking for...

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 the stone in that room.

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Is that so?

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 We have to keep it a secret.

323
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Don't let anyone know.

324
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Don't let them know.

325
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Agree?

326
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 But, listen.

327
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 You have to know this.

328
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 If you're not the one who's in charge,

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 he'll be investigated.

330
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Your job now is...

331
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 to keep it a secret.

332
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Okay? / Yes, sir.

333
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Let's go.

334
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Ready? / Yes, sir.

335
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Let's go.

336
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 "The Stone of Akulila"

337
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 "The Stone of Akulila"

338
00:21:36,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Angara.

339
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 To make our plan easier,

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 we'll stay here.

341
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Because this building is near the school.

342
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So, we can keep an eye on them.

343
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Yes, sir. / Let's go.

344
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Sir.

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It's true.

346
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 We're not supposed to rest in a dirty place like this.

347
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 "The Stone of Akulila"

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You're amazing, sir.

349
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Wait. / Angara.

350
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Get up.

351
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 This is the place.

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Then, where do I sleep?

353
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 You sleep here.

354
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 What's wrong?

355
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Nothing, sir.

356
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 For now,

357
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 this will be our base.

358
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 So, we can keep an eye on them.

359
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Until we get a chance...

360
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 to take everything from them.

361
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Yes, sir.

362
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 "The Stone of Akulila"

363
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000

 I want to sleep.

377
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Don't be noisy.

378
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 What? You're fast asleep.

379
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I know.

380
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 What?

381
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 We're not the same.

382
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 So, don't play with me.

383
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I need to sleep.

384
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Do you know that?

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 What are you doing?

386
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Why do you need to sleep?

387
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I want to lead my parents.

388
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 I want to ask them to show me.

389
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I have an idea.

390
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I know how.

391
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I have a mantra.

392
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 So, people can sleep soundly.

393
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Are you serious?

394
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Yes.

395
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Okay.

396
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Let me do it.

397
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Sleep soundly.

398
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 [Mantra]

399
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 It's so cool.

400
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I know. I'm smart.

401
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Dad.

402
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Mom.

403
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Where are you?

404
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 What?

405
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Dad.

406
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Mom.

407
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 What?

408
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I'm so happy.

409
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Dad and mom can live together again.

410
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You said that we'll be together again.

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Yes.

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 If Gama and Akuwila appear in your dream,

413
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 ask them.

414
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Ask them what I have to do...

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 to wake them up.

416
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Dad.

417
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Mom.

418
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Can you show me?

419
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 What is that?

420
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Show me so that you can be supported again.

421
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Alva.

422
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Is it difficult?

423
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 No.

424
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I'll try no matter how difficult it is.

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 So that you can be supported again.

426
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Alva.

427
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 There's only one way to remove the curse.

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 That is the blood of the 8th prince.

429
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 I don't want to be a burden to you.

430
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I want to be a good son.

431
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 I want to be a good father.

432
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Remove the blood of the 8th prince.

433
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Then the curse will be lifted.

434
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 What's wrong?

435
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Why did you say the blood of the 8th prince?

436
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I have a clue.

437
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 My parents can sense...

438
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 if they're being smeared with the blood of the 8th prince.

439
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 The blood of the 8th prince?

440
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Yes.

441
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Alva.

442
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Where are you going?

443
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I'm going to find the 8th prince.

444
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 But how?

445
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I don't know how.

446
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 But I have to go there.

447
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 What are you doing?

448
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Hurry up.

449
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Let me go.

450
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 I miss them.

451
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Let me go.

452
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I want them to live.

453
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Let me go.

454
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I want them to live.

455
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I miss them.

456
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 That's why I have to find the 8th prince.

457
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 So that they can live.

458
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Don't be sad.

459
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I'm crying too.

460
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Don't cry.

461
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Alva.

462
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 We know you're sad.

463
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But don't be sad.

464
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 If you want to fight the 8th prince, that's okay.

465
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 But we have to make a plan first.

466
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 What if you lose?

467
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 What will happen to you?

468
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Your parents will be sad.

469
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Do you want that?

470
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Yes.

471
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 We know you're sad.

472
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 What's that sound?

473
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Someone's coming.

474
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Let's go.

475
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Who's that?

476
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 We found you.

477
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Professor Poa is kidnapped.

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 What are you doing?

479
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I'm dreaming.

480
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 You told me that you can't come here.

481
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Shut up.

482
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Don't comment.

483
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 I'll make you pay.

484
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 I'll make you pay.

485
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Shut up.

486
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 We're not done yet.

487
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Not yet.

488
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Where are you going?

489
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 I'm going to pee.

490
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 To be continued...

491
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Mega Dark.

492
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Are you sure...

493
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 ...Nik and his friends are ready?

494
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 I'm sure.

495
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 The four of them have passed the test.

496
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 So I think they can help me find the soul stone.

497
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 So, where are we going?

498
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 The closest soul stone is in a village.

499
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 It's far from here.

500
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Thousands of kilometers.

501
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Are you ready?

502
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 We're ready.

503
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I'll go with them.

504
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 So, don't worry.

505
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Don't worry.

506
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Bring him.

507
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 What is this?

508
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 It's a detector.

509
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It's like a magnet.

510
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 So it won't be suspicious.

511
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 When the detector makes a beep, it means there's a soul stone.

512
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 And the children can hear it.

513
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 "The children can hear it."

514
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Okay, professor.

515
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Go back to your room.

516
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Prepare your things.

517
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 We're going to the village tonight.

518
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Yes, sir.

519
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Professor.

520
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It's a test.

521
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 I've always wanted to know about people.

522
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 What is this?

523
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Yes, sir.

524
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Can I talk to you?

525
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Sure.

526
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 I've told my parents.

527
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Your parents?

528
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 How is it, Alva?

529
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 What did they say?

530
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I've shown them.

531
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 They said they could sense...

532
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 ...if they were smeared with the dark spirit's blood.

533
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 The dark spirit's blood?

534
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Yes, the dark spirit's blood.

535
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Alva...

536
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 It's impossible. It's very difficult.

537
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Especially now, calling the dark spirit and finding its biggest power.

538
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 But I have to answer it...

539
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 ...for my parents.

540
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 So they'll be aware.

541
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Okay, here's the thing.

542
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 The first thing we have to do is...

543
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 ...to find out where the dark spirit's base is.

544
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 I don't care.

545
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 I'll punish them when they arrive at school.

546
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 We can do it.

547
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 We can do it.

548
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 I won't give up so easily.

549
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 I'll do it.

550
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

551
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

552
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

553
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

554
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

555
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

556
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

557
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 The dark spirit won't be affected by the fire.

558
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Smart.

559
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 "Dark spirit's base"

560
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Stop it!

561
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 No, sir.

562
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Maybe it's the old prototype that's affected by Vega.

563
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Let's just continue our conversation.

564
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 It's the professor.

565
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Sir, where is he?

566
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 He's not here.

567
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 It's the professor again.

568
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 But his voice was so clear.

569
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 He was so loud.

570
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 I don't know why.

571
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Maybe he went back to his room.

572
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 That's impossible.

573
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Let's go to his room. I'm sleepy.

574
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Me too.

575
00:37:42,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 You're so naive.

576
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 I'll punish them when they arrive at school.

577
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 What if we know where the base is?

578
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 After we know the location,

579
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 we'll make a plan to get rid of the dark spirit.

580
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Now, we have to do the first thing.

581
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Follow me. I'll ask for help.

582
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Who do you want to meet?

583
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 A ghost hunter?

584
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Yes.

585
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 His name is Gherbo.

586
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 He's a very clever and lonely hunter.

587
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 I'm sure he can find the base of the dark spirit.

588
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Great.

589
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Gherbo, find the base of the dark spirit.

590
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 [Gherbo's voice]

591
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Are you ready?

592
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Yes, sir!

593
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Listen.

594
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 We have a long way to go.

595
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 Remember.

596
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Whatever happens,

597
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 you have to stay on your lollipop.

598
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Yes, sir!

599
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Wait.

600
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Get ready.

601
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 On the count of three.

602
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 One, two, three.

603
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Fly!

604
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Where are they going, sir?

605
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 It doesn't matter.

606
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Now is your chance.

607
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 You'll take the dark spirit's toxin.

608
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 Then you'll be the head of the school.

609
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Yes, sir.

610
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 What's this lollipop for?

611
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 You'll use this lollipop on the dark spirit.

612
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 So he can't go anywhere.

613
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 Then the fire guard will come and put him in the fire prison.

614
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 Our business will go well, Angkara.

615
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Don't fail, Angkara.

616
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Here.

617
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Aldo Baran.

618
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Your time as the head of the school...

619
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 will be over.

620
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 (laughing)

621
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Password.

622
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 What's the password?

623
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Password?

624
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Wrong.

625
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Hey.

626
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Don't play around.

627
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 I order you to open this door.

628
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Or I'll act aggressively.

629
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Let's go.

630
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Wrong again.

631
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 You only have three chances.

632
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 If you make three mistakes, you'll be blocked.

633
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Who are you?

634
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 I've never seen you before.

635
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 Oh, I'm a teacher.

636
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 I'm from the magic school.

637
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Wrong again.

638
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 You'll be blocked.

639
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 You did that on purpose, right?

640
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 You trapped me.

641
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Now, open this door.

642
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Come on, open this door.

643
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 No, you're blocked.

644
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Fine.

645
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 If you don't want to open this door, I'll do it myself.

646
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 (playing the flute)

647
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 You're blocking my way.

648
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 (explosion)

649
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 (screaming)

650
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 (laughing)

651
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 What's the matter?

652
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 It turns out that Professor Badung is also here.

653
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Yes, he's the principal.

654
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 He must be the little professor.

655
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 He has red hair.

656
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 It's none of your business.

657
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Now, let me go.

658
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Hurry up.

659
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Why are you just standing there?

660
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 Hurry up.

661
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Let me explain.

662
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 I'll take revenge on your teacher.

663
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 (screaming)

664
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 Kids, go out.

665
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Help!

666
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Eric!

667
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 (explosion)

668
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 (music)

669
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 You saw that, right?

670
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 The face of the principal is so cute.

671
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 So, he deserves to be fired.

672
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 (laughing)

673
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 The face is so cute.

674
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Why is everyone quiet?

675
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 (whispering)

676
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Professor Borowa.

677
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 (whispering)

678
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 I have to persuade them...

679
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 so that they'll know what's really going on in that room.

680
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 I'm sorry, Professor.

681
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 We're not enough.

682
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 I won't scold you.

683
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 I even have something for you.

684
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 What is it?

685
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 A chocolate and a candy.

686
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 Chocolate and a candy?

687
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Look at this.

688
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 This can be yours.

689
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 But, Professor, why are you so mean?

690
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 Usually, you're mean when we're fighting.

691
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 I'll give this to you.

692
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 But, before that...

693
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 I want to ask you all something.

694
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 I'll even make you my students.

695
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 As long as you tell me...

696
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 what's behind that room.

697
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 I'm serious, Bro.

698
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Serious?

699
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Serious.

700
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 I never break my promise.

701
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 How is this?

702
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 This can be yours.

703
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 (whispering)

704
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Look, Professor.

705
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 I want to talk to you.

706
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Yes, come on.

707
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Tell me.

708
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Tell me.

709
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 What is it?

710
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 This can be yours.

711
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 Tell me.

712
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Tell me.

713
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 What's behind that room?

714
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 This can be yours.

715
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Come here.

716
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Professor Nyaga.

717
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Shut up!

718
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 You don't appreciate my kindness.

719
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 I've been kind.

720
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 But, this can be yours.

721
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 It's mine.

722
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 Professor.

723
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 Don't be scared.

724
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 Everyone has a secret.

725
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Yes, Prof.

726
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 If the secret is Professor, we'll correct it.

727
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Right, Prof?

728
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Yes, right.

729
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 Yes, Prof.

730
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 Shut up!

731
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 Watch out.

732
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 You'll get your punishment.

733
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 Wait.

734
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 What is it?

735
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 This is a toy.

736
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 A lollipop.

737
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 A lollipop for our friends.

738
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 And a chocolate too.

739
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 Watch out.

740
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Take it.

741
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 Come here.

742
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Eat it, Prof.

743
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 I want to eat it.

744
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 I want to eat it.

745
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 I want to eat it.

746
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 I want to eat it.

747
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 The rain is heavy.

748
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 The rain is heavy.

749
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 I can't see the front.

750
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 Don't panic.

751
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 Calm down.

752
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 We must fly.

753
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 And don't stop.

754
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 We must fly.

755
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 Stay alert.

756
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 Yes, sir.

757
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 Help!

758
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 Eric!

759
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 Help!

760
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 Eric!

761
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Thank you, sir.

762
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Yes.

763
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 Calm down, Eric.

764
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 You too.

765
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 I'll protect you.

766
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 After we cross the sea, I'll give you a new lollipop.

767
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 Yes, sir.

768
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 Eric!

769
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 Eric!

770
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 Eric!

771
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 Eric!

772
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 Eric!

773
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 Eric!

774
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Eric!

775
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 Eric!

776
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 Eric!

777
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Eric!

778
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 Ergo.

779
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 How is it?

780
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 Have you found the place?

781
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 It's over there.

782
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 Okay.

783
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 Thank you, Ergo.

784
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Alva.

785
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Alva.

786
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 Alva.

787
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 It's raining.

788
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Virgo is back.

789
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 And he has found the base of the Dark Lord.

790
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 Thank God.

791
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 When are we leaving?

792
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 Now.

793
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 Okay.

794
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 Wake the others up.

795
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 We'll leave together.

796
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 That's not their business.

797
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 They're still sleepy.

798
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Let's just leave together.

799
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 Okay.

800
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Let's go.

801
00:51:46,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Where are they?

802
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 I've never seen a couple this close.

803
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 I'm embarrassed.

804
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 To be continued...

805
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 We must be apart

806
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 We must be apart

807
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 Who are you?

808
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 What are you looking for?

809
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 What is this?

810
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 Let's go.

811
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 Let's go.

812
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 Let's go.

813
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:57,000
 Where are they?

814
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 Where are they?

815
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 To be continued...

816
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 To be continued...

817
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 To be continued...

818
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 To be continued...

819
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 They must have done this on purpose.

820
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 They must have hidden.

821
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 This is too much.

822
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 Alva and I.

823
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 Professor Aldebaran must know about this.

824
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 I'll report this to the professor.

825
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 Who are you?

826
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 I'm asking you.

827
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Who are you?

828
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 To be continued...

829
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 Who are you?

830
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 Answer me.

831
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 Who are you?

832
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 I won't ask you again.

833
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
 Who are you?

834
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 Amifis!

835
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 To be continued...

836
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 Lightning!

837
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 To be continued...

838
00:55:44,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 To be continued...

839
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 To be continued...

840
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:25,000
 Who are you?

841
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 Who are you?

842
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 You must still remember me.

843
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 Aldebaran.

844
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:45,000
 Hey, police officer.

845
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 Come here.

846
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 Your prey is ready.

847
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 To be continued...

848
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 Come on. Catch him.

849
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 Yes, sir.

850
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 Let me go.

851
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 Goodbye, Aldebaran.

852
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 To be continued...

853
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 Finally, Aldebaran.

854
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 To be continued...

855
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 We're here, Alva.

856
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
 So, this is the hot one.

857
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 Alva, wait.

858
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 To be continued...

859
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 Why?

860
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 Why can't I?

861
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 You see?

862
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 If you had passed him, you would feel the same.

863
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 Alva, we have to be careful.

864
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 This place is monitored by the Black Mantra.

865
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 We must not act recklessly.

866
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 Finally.

867
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
 Finally, I can sit here.

868
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 From today,

869
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 no one can stop me in this school.

870
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
 To be continued...

871
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 To be continued...

872
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 Ankara?

873
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 Oh, Purwa.

874
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
 What is it, Purwa?

875
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Ankara.

876
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 Why are you in Aldebaran's room?

877
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
 Where is he?

878
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 Tell me.

879
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 Purwa.

880
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 Aldebaran has retired.

881
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 And starting today,

882
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 I'm replacing him as the head of the magic school here.

883
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Retired?

884
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 Impossible.

885
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 That's impossible.

886
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
 You're kidding.

887
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 I'm not kidding, Purwa.

888
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 If you want the proof,

889
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 come here right now.

890
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 This is impossible.

891
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
 He must be lying.

892
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 He must be lying.

893
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
 Impossible.

894
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 What's that sound?

895
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 That's good.

896
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 I think it's Purwa.

897
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 What's wrong?

898
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 I'm tired of the head of the magic school.

899
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 What if he's trapped again?

900
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 Let's go and see.

901
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 Let's go.

902
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 What's that?

903
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 What's that?

904
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 Sir, thank you.

905
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
 I'm so happy.

906
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 I'm the head of this school.

907
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 We can do it.

908
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 We can do it.

909
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 So, how do we get out of here?

910
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 The only way...

911
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 to get out of here is a light.

912
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 A light that is so bright...

913
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 that it can destroy the magic school.

914
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 The question is,

915
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
 where do we get the light from?

916
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
 Oh, right.

917
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
 I'll ask for help from Putri Bintang.

918
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 Putri Bintang?

919
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
 Putri Bintang!

920
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 Putri Bintang!

921
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 Putri Bintang!

922
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
 Alva?

923
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 Hi, Alva.

924
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 How did it go?

925
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 It went well.

926
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 Thank you for helping me.

927
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
 Can I ask for help again?

928
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 Sure.

929
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 I'm ready to help you.

930
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 What do you want?

931
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 If I can get the light...

932
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 to this building.

933
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 Okay.

934
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 Because your task is to get the light.

935
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 So, get ready.

936
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 (Go, go, go)

937
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 (Reach all your dreams)

938
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 (Go, go, go)

939
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 (Never stop)

940
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
 (Go, go, go)

941
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
 (Fight with the power of your soul)

942
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 (Go, go, go)

943
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
 (Make yourself)

944
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
 (Go, go, go)

945
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 (Let's dream)

946
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 (Go, go, go)

947
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 Thank you, Putri Bintang.

948
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 Bintang!

949
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
 Yes, Alva.

950
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
 If you need anything, just call me.

951
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
 I'm ready to help you.

952
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 Okay.

953
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 Alva.

954
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
 You're amazing.

955
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
 You can be friends with the stars.

956
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 Not many people are like that.

957
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 Okay.

958
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
 But before that, let's try again.

959
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 (Go, go, go)

960
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
 (Reach all your dreams)

961
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
 (Go, go, go)

962
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
 (Make yourself)

963
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
 (Go, go, go)

964
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 Did you make it?

965
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 Yes.

966
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 I think the black magic is gone.

967
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
 Mike, now...

968
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
 I'll plan to go inside.

969
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 Okay.

970
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
 I'll be back.

971
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 (The black magic is gone)

972
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:14,000
 Where are you?

973
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 Where are you?

974
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 Where are you?

975
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
 (The black magic is gone)

976
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
 (The black magic is gone)

977
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 Let's go home, Alva.

978
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 The black magic is gone.

979
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 Let's go home.

980
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
 (The black magic is gone)

981
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 I've been given a job.

982
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 How's your work there?

983
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
 Sir.

984
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 Thank you, sir.

985
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
 I'm very happy, sir.

986
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 Because starting today...

987
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
 I'm the one who will be the headmaster in this school, sir.

988
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 (The black magic is gone)

989
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
 Good.

990
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 Good.

991
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 Sir.

992
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 I went to far away.

993
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 But, the black magic is gone.

994
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 There's nothing wasted.

995
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 Next time, we can come back.

996
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 The important thing now...

997
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 You have to be there.

998
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 That's Professor Poba.

999
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
 Why?

1000
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 He was shouting.

1001
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
 I don't know why.

1002
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
 Professor Poba.

1003
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 Where are you going?

1004
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:16,000
 You're angry with the students.

1005
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
 And now, you decide to leave.

1006
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 Because of me.

1007
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
 Shut up, you.

1008
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 Now, there's a very serious situation in the school.

1009
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 I have to go home.

1010
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
 And all of you have to go home now.

1011
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 But, professor.

1012
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
 Don't lie to me.

1013
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
 I'm serious.

1014
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 You know.

1015
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
 I contacted the school.

1016
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 I want to talk to the new headmaster.

1017
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
 But, guess.

1018
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 Who am I talking to?

1019
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 Kara.

1020
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
 Professor Kara.

1021
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 You go home with your parents.

1022
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 What's wrong, sis?

1023
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 The headmaster is in my hands now.

1024
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 And this means...

1025
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 I'm the official headmaster.

1026
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 That's scary.

1027
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 Luckily, it's not a chicken.

1028
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
 If it's a chicken, I can peel it.

1029
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
 I'm dead.

1030
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
 Where's my money?

1031
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
 I'm so lonely.

1032
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 [music]

1033
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 [music]

1034
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 [music]

1035
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 [music]

1036
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,200
 Jumping and racing stars

1037
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:17,780
 Bravery, unknown words, giving up

1038
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:24,420
 Chase love and dreams

1039
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,460
 Go go go

1040
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,880
 Reach all the dreams

1041
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,800
 Go go go

1042
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,280
 Don't ever stop

1043
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,200
 Go go go

1044
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:38,120
 Fight with the power of your heart

1045
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,080
 Go go go

1046
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,560
 Make yourself proud

1047
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,520
 Go go go

1048
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,960
 Let's dream

1049
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,160
 Go go go

1050
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,280
 We will
