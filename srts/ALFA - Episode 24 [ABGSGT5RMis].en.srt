When the dark lord attacked you,

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
there was a power that appeared in you

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and made the dark lord furious

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When he wanted to attack you again,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
he realized that he had lost all his power

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What do you want, Angkar?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will grant it

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to be the head of the school of magic

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What a coincidence, Angkar

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's what you're thinking

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will allow you to live here

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but on one condition

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What condition, sir?

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You have to fight me

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Fire!

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will make this school the second head of the school of magic

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Just watch me

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You will know that I'm better than you

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The second round

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000

Ten

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Angkar, you're dead!

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The soul stone will spread all over the school of magic

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's far away, thousands of kilometers

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it will be rain, thunder, and sand

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Will you be able to go to the school of magic like that?

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Enjoy the last round of the final round

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because tomorrow, I will be sitting there

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And this room will be my room

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now, let's welcome the new head of the school

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The head of the school that we have been waiting for

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The head of the school of magic that is the most powerful

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who is he?

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We will not wait for anyone else

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Professor Angkara!

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're all so good!

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Angkara, you're great!

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You deserve to be the head of the school of magic

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I feel like I'm hearing voices

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Now, the third round

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The third round!

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
One

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Two

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Three

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Finish it!

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
[The third round]

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm going to fall!

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You said you're going to finish it!

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wait! Wait!

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It can't be like that!

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I won the first round

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That means I won!

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry, Professor

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The decision of the students can't be changed

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What should we do now?

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I know the way

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why don't you just tell Alfa to finish it?

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's a good idea!

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I agree!

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Alfa

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The two of you

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The one who never gives up

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you're angry, she'll always be angry

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay?

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
One, two, three!

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We're still the winners!

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We're going home

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
All of you

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We're done singing

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll take my leave

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the lesson will be continued by Professor Tita

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Professor Agni, Professor Yasmin

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll take my leave

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Good afternoon, students!

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Good afternoon, sir!

100
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wow!

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're all smiling!

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you miss Professor Tita?

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, sir!

104
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Now, before the lesson starts

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You have to say hello to Professor Tita

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Try to imitate her

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Say "Ahai" with a smile

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's try

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Ahai!

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
With a smile!

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
With a smile, too!

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Do you want chocolate?

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, sir!

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you want lollipop?

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes, sir!

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, I'll give you one

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
With a smile!

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Put your right hand first

119
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Still okay?

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Here's your prize!

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
A mosquito raincoat!

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Mosquito!

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ahai!

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
With a smile!

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Very good!

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Now, finish the mosquito!

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why are we still drinking mosquitoes?

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We want chocolate and lollipop, not mosquitoes!

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mosquitoes are not tasty!

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's right!

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You have to go to war

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So you have to drink mosquitoes

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So you can be strong!

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Not like that, Professor Jasmine

135
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Professor Agni

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Students, what Professor Tan said is true

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Mosquitoes are very pitiful

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So you have to drink them all

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes, ma'am!

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Very good!

141
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, I'm going to drink the mosquito!

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
My students!

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Ahai!

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
With a smile!

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you feel strong now?

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes, sir!

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Now, I'm going to teach you a mantra

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This mantra is called "Airfang Mantra"

149
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Here's an example

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Get some airfang!

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My students, look!

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
At the end of this line, there's water

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's the use of airfang mantra

154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm thirsty! I want to drink water!

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Airfang!

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Me too!

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Airfang!

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You have to practice seriously

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't be silly!

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You have to face the darkness with spirit

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't play around!

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you understand?

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes, sir!

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Listen to what Professor Agni and Professor Jasmine said

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now, you have to try it together

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And whoever can get the most water from the end of the line

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Will get a present from me

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay?

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's try it now!

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's try it!

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Airfang Mantra

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wow!

173
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Give me a smile!

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Very good!

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
My students, the one who can get the most water from the end of the line

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Is me!

177
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So, I'll give you a present

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I got a brown one!

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Thank you, sir!

180
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're welcome, Nick

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How does it taste?

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's so good, Prof!

183
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The brown one is so tasty!

184
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And it's big inside!

185
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's so good, Nick!

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Nick, choose one!

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And for the other students

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If you can do this again

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You'll also get a present from the professor

190
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Do you understand?

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, sir!

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Smart!

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Give me a smile!

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So, students

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you all ready to be tested?

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What test, Prof?

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The bonsai tree is being watered

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
While the fruit is not yet ripe

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hi, students!

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Megantara is here!

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Is there anything we can do for you, Megantara?

202
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Of course!

203
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Why are you all here?

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Students

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's a task for you

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What is it?

207
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry, Megantara

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I can't help you with this

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're the one who's responsible for this

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry, Megantara

211
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But I can't help you with this

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're the one who's responsible for this

213
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sorry, Megantara

214
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But I can't help you with this

215
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You're the one who's responsible for this

216
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're so pretty

217
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you know me?

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm Jack

219
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
My name is Tommy

220
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
My name is Mike

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There's another attack!

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a boar!

223
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What?

224
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's a boar!

225
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Eyes right.

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Come on, fight.

227
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Find her weak spot.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Come on, Benjo.

229
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Where is Anebaran's last card?

230
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Eyes right.

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Eyes left.

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Eyes right.

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Eyes left.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Eyes right.

235
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Eyes left.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Only Nick and three of his friends are alive.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
How is this?

238
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Anebaran's last card.

239
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
How can you beat the 8th Prince?

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You've lost to Duyung.

241
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Megantara.

242
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It seems like they're not ready.

243
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But, Professor Ado.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The Stone of Soul.

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They have to get it.

246
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Kids.

247
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Come on.

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Use Airfah's spell.

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Airfah.

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's Duyung.

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Nick.

252
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's Duyung.

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes.

254
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We did it.

255
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Kids.

257
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You've succeeded.

258
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You're accepted.

259
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes.

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Megantara.

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
These kids are being tested.

262
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You shouldn't tell them the answer.

263
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What are you doing here?

264
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If other people know, our plan will fail.

265
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry, sir.

266
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm just checking this room.

267
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Because I'll be in this room soon.

268
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
"The Stone of Soul"

269
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Help.

270
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Please help us.

271
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't hurt us.

272
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Whose voice is that?

273
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is that the voice?

274
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's none of your business.

275
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If you feel bothered by that voice,

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
there's a river nearby.

277
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm here to pick up the kids.

278
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Not to have fun.

279
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't have money to live.

280
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not like usual.

281
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're looking for freebies?

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
"The Stone of Soul"

283
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Come here.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I want to warn you.

285
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't tell the others about the stone in that room.

286
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's go.

287
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why?

288
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can't trust the others.

289
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Moreover,

290
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the less people know,

291
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
the better.

292
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because if they find out...

293
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that you and Akulila are still alive,

294
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
he'll come after them.

295
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Who's that?

296
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I think he's looking for...

297
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the stone in that room.

298
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is that so?

299
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We have to keep it a secret.

300
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Don't let anyone know.

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't let them know.

302
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Agree?

303
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But, listen.

304
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You have to know this.

305
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If you're not the one who's in charge,

306
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
he'll be investigated.

307
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Your job now is...

308
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
to keep it a secret.

309
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Okay? / Yes, sir.

310
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's go.

311
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Ready? / Yes, sir.

312
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's go.

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
"The Stone of Akulila"

314
00:21:36,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Angara.

315
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
To make our plan easier,

316
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
we'll stay here.

317
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Because this building is near the school.

318
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So, we can keep an eye on them.

319
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes, sir. / Let's go.

320
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Sir.

321
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's true.

322
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We're not supposed to rest in a dirty place like this.

323
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
"The Stone of Akulila"

324
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're amazing, sir.

325
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Wait. / Angara.

326
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Get up.

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
This is the place.

328
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then, where do I sleep?

329
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You sleep here.

330
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What's wrong?

331
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Nothing, sir.

332
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
For now,

333
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
this will be our base.

334
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So, we can keep an eye on them.

335
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Until we get a chance...

336
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
to take everything from them.

337
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, sir.

338
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
"The Stone of Akulila"

339
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
â™ª Get your spirit up, get your enthusiasm ready â™ª

â™ª Chase your feelings and dreams â™ª

â™ª Run with all your might â™ª

â™ª Go, go, go â™ª

350
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Be quiet.

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I want to sleep.

352
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Don't be noisy.

353
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What? You're fast asleep.

354
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I know.

355
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What?

356
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We're not the same.

357
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So, don't play with me.

358
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I need to sleep.

359
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Do you know that?

360
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What are you doing?

361
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Why do you need to sleep?

362
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I want to lead my parents.

363
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I want to ask them to show me.

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I have an idea.

365
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I know how.

366
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I have a mantra.

367
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So, people can sleep soundly.

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Are you serious?

369
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes.

370
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay.

371
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let me do it.

372
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Sleep soundly.

373
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
[Mantra]

374
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's so cool.

375
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I know. I'm smart.

376
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Dad.

377
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Mom.

378
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Where are you?

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What?

380
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Dad.

381
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Mom.

382
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What?

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm so happy.

384
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Dad and mom can live together again.

385
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You said that we'll be together again.

386
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yes.

387
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If Gama and Akuwila appear in your dream,

388
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
ask them.

389
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Ask them what I have to do...

390
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
to wake them up.

391
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Dad.

392
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Mom.

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Can you show me?

394
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What is that?

395
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Show me so that you can be supported again.

396
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Alfa.

397
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Is it difficult?

398
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
No.

399
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll try no matter how difficult it is.

400
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So that you can be supported again.

401
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Alfa.

402
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
There's only one way to remove the curse.

403
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That is the blood of the 8th prince.

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't want to be a burden to you.

405
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I want to be a good son.

406
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I want to be a good father.

407
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Remove the blood of the 8th prince.

408
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then the curse will be lifted.

409
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
What's wrong?

410
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why did you say the blood of the 8th prince?

411
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I have a clue.

412
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
My parents can sense...

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
if they're being smeared with the blood of the 8th prince.

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The blood of the 8th prince?

415
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yes.

416
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Alfa.

417
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Where are you going?

418
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm going to find the 8th prince.

419
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But how?

420
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't know how.

421
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But I have to go there.

422
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What are you doing?

423
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Hurry up.

424
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Let me go.

425
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I miss them.

426
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let me go.

427
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I want them to live.

428
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Let me go.

429
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I want them to live.

430
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I miss them.

431
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That's why I have to find the 8th prince.

432
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So that they can live.

433
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Don't be sad.

434
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm crying too.

435
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Don't cry.

436
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Alfa.

437
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We know you're sad.

438
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But don't be sad.

439
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
If you want to fight the 8th prince, that's okay.

440
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But we have to make a plan first.

441
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What if you lose?

442
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What will happen to you?

443
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Your parents will be sad.

444
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Do you want that?

445
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yes.

446
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We know you're sad.

447
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What's that sound?

448
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Someone's coming.

449
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Let's go.

450
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Who's that?

451
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We found you.

452
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Professor Poa is kidnapped.

453
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What are you doing?

454
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm dreaming.

455
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You told me that you can't come here.

456
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Shut up.

457
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Don't comment.

458
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'll make you pay.

459
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Shut up.

460
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
We're not done yet.

461
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Not yet.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Where are you going?

463
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm going to pee.

464
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Mega Dark.

465
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Are you sure...

466
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
...Nik and his friends are ready?

467
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sure.

468
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The four of them have passed the test.

469
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So I think they can help me find the soul stone.

470
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So, where are we going?

471
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The closest soul stone is in a village.

472
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's far from here.

473
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Thousands of kilometers.

474
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Are you ready?

475
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We're ready.

476
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'll go with them.

477
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So, don't worry.

478
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Don't worry.

479
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Bring him.

480
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
What is this?

481
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's a detector.

482
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's like a magnet.

483
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So it won't be suspicious.

484
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
When the detector makes a beep, it means there's a soul stone.

485
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And the children can hear it.

486
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
"The children can hear it."

487
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay, professor.

488
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Go back to your room.

489
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Prepare your things.

490
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
We're going to the village tonight.

491
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes, sir.

492
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Professor.

493
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's a test.

494
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I've always wanted to know about people.

495
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
What is this?

496
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yes, sir.

497
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Can I talk to you?

498
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Sure.

499
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I've told my parents.

500
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Your parents?

501
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
How is it, Alfa?

502
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
What did they say?

503
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I've shown them.

504
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
They said they could sense...

505
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
...if they were smeared with the dark spirit's blood.

506
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The dark spirit's blood?

507
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes, the dark spirit's blood.

508
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Alfa...

509
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's impossible. It's very difficult.

510
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Especially now, calling the dark spirit and finding its biggest power.

511
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But I have to answer it...

512
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
...for my parents.

513
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So they'll be aware.

514
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay, here's the thing.

515
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The first thing we have to do is...

516
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
...to find out where the dark spirit's base is.

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't care.

518
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'll punish them when they arrive at school.

519
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:04,000
We can do it.

520
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I won't give up so easily.

521
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'll do it.

522
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:47,000
"Dark spirit's base"

523
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The dark spirit won't be affected by the fire.

524
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Smart.

525
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
"Dark spirit's base"

526
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Stop it!

527
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:53,000
No, sir.

528
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Maybe it's the old prototype that's affected by Vega.

529
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's just continue our conversation.

530
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's the professor.

531
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Sir, where is he?

532
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He's not here.

533
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's the professor again.

534
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But his voice was so clear.

535
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He was so loud.

536
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I don't know why.

537
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Maybe he went back to his room.

538
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That's impossible.

539
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Let's go to his room. I'm sleepy.

540
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Me too.

541
00:37:42,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You're so naive.

542
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'll punish them when they arrive at school.

543
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What if we know where the base is?

544
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
After we know the location,

545
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
we'll make a plan to get rid of the dark spirit.

546
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Now, we have to do the first thing.

547
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Follow me. I'll ask for help.

548
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Who do you want to meet?

549
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:59,000
A ghost hunter?

550
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes.

551
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
His name is Gherbo.

552
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
He's a very clever and lonely hunter.

553
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm sure he can find the base of the dark spirit.

554
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Great.

555
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Gherbo, find the base of the dark spirit.

556
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
[Gherbo's voice]

557
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Are you ready?

558
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yes, sir!

559
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Listen.

560
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We have a long way to go.

561
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Remember.

562
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Whatever happens,

563
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
you have to stay on your lollipop.

564
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yes, sir!

565
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Wait.

566
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Get ready.

567
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
On the count of three.

568
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
One, two, three.

569
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Fly!

570
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Where are they going, sir?

571
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It doesn't matter.

572
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Now is your chance.

573
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You'll take the dark spirit's toxin.

574
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Then you'll be the head of the school.

575
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes, sir.

576
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
What's this lollipop for?

577
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You'll use this lollipop on the dark spirit.

578
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So he can't go anywhere.

579
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Then the fire guard will come and put him in the fire prison.

580
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Our business will go well, Angkara.

581
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Don't fail, Angkara.

582
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Here.

583
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Aldo Baran.

584
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Your time as the head of the school...

585
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
will be over.

586
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
(laughing)

587
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Password.

588
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What's the password?

589
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Password?

590
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Wrong.

591
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Hey.

592
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Don't play around.

593
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I order you to open this door.

594
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Or I'll act aggressively.

595
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Let's go.

596
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Wrong again.

597
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You only have three chances.

598
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If you make three mistakes, you'll be blocked.

599
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Who are you?

600
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I've never seen you before.

601
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, I'm a teacher.

602
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm from the magic school.

603
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Wrong again.

604
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You'll be blocked.

605
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You did that on purpose, right?

606
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You trapped me.

607
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Now, open this door.

608
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Come on, open this door.

609
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
No, you're blocked.

610
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Fine.

611
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
If you don't want to open this door, I'll do it myself.

612
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
(playing the flute)

613
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You're blocking my way.

614
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
(explosion)

615
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
(screaming)

616
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
(laughing)

617
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
What's the matter?

618
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It turns out that Professor Badung is also here.

619
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yes, he's the principal.

620
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
He must be the little professor.

621
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
He has red hair.

622
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's none of your business.

623
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Now, let me go.

624
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Hurry up.

625
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Why are you just standing there?

626
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Hurry up.

627
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Let me explain.

628
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'll take revenge on your teacher.

629
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
(screaming)

630
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Kids, go out.

631
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Help!

632
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Eric!

633
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
(explosion)

634
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
(music)

635
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You saw that, right?

636
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The face of the principal is so cute.

637
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So, he deserves to be fired.

638
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
(laughing)

639
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The face is so cute.

640
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Why is everyone quiet?

641
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
(whispering)

642
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Professor Borowa.

643
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
(whispering)

644
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I have to persuade them...

645
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
so that they'll know what's really going on in that room.

646
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm sorry, Professor.

647
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We're not enough.

648
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I won't scold you.

649
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I even have something for you.

650
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
What is it?

651
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
A chocolate and a candy.

652
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Chocolate and a candy?

653
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Look at this.

654
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
This can be yours.

655
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But, Professor, why are you so mean?

656
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Usually, you're mean when we're fighting.

657
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'll give this to you.

658
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But, before that...

659
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I want to ask you all something.

660
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'll even make you my students.

661
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
As long as you tell me...

662
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
what's behind that room.

663
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm serious, Bro.

664
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Serious?

665
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Serious.

666
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I never break my promise.

667
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
How is this?

668
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
This can be yours.

669
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
(whispering)

670
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Look, Professor.

671
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I want to talk to you.

672
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yes, come on.

673
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Tell me.

674
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
What is it?

675
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
This can be yours.

676
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Tell me.

677
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
What's behind that room?

678
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
This can be yours.

679
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Come here.

680
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Professor Nyaga.

681
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Shut up!

682
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You don't appreciate my kindness.

683
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I've been kind.

684
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But, this can be yours.

685
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's mine.

686
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Professor.

687
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Don't be scared.

688
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Everyone has a secret.

689
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yes, Prof.

690
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
If the secret is Professor, we'll correct it.

691
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Right, Prof?

692
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yes, right.

693
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yes, Prof.

694
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Shut up!

695
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Watch out.

696
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You'll get your punishment.

697
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Wait.

698
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
What is it?

699
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
This is a toy.

700
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
A lollipop.

701
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
A lollipop for our friends.

702
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And a chocolate too.

703
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Watch out.

704
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Take it.

705
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Come here.

706
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Eat it, Prof.

707
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I want to eat it.

708
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The rain is heavy.

709
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I can't see the front.

710
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Don't panic.

711
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Calm down.

712
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
We must fly.

713
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And don't stop.

714
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We must fly.

715
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Stay alert.

716
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yes, sir.

717
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Help!

718
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Eric!

719
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Help!

720
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Eric!

721
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Thank you, sir.

722
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yes.

723
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Calm down, Eric.

724
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You too.

725
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I'll protect you.

726
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
After we cross the sea, I'll give you a new lollipop.

727
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yes, sir.

728
00:49:45,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Eric!

729
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Ergo.

730
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
How is it?

731
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Have you found the place?

732
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It's over there.

733
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Okay.

734
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Thank you, Ergo.

735
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Alfa.

736
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's raining.

737
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Virgo is back.

738
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And he has found the base of the Dark Lord.

739
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Thank God.

740
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
When are we leaving?

741
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Now.

742
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Okay.

743
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Wake the others up.

744
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
We'll leave together.

745
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That's not their business.

746
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
They're still sleepy.

747
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Let's just leave together.

748
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Okay.

749
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Let's go.

750
00:51:46,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Where are they?

751
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I've never seen a couple this close.

752
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm embarrassed.

753
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:39,000
We must be apart

754
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Who are you?

755
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
What are you looking for?

756
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
What is this?

757
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Let's go.

758
00:53:47,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Where are they?

759
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:29,000
They must have done this on purpose.

760
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They must have hidden.

761
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This is too much.

762
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Alfa and I.

763
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Professor Aldebaran must know about this.

764
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'll report this to the professor.

765
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Who are you?

766
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm asking you.

767
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Who are you?

768
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Answer me.

769
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Who are you?

770
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I won't ask you again.

771
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Who are you?

772
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Amifis!

773
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Lightning!

774
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Who are you?

775
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You must still remember me.

776
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Aldebaran.

777
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Hey, police officer.

778
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Come here.

779
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Your prey is ready.

780
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Come on. Catch him.

781
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yes, sir.

782
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Let me go.

783
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Goodbye, Aldebaran.

784
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Finally, Aldebaran.

785
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:52,000
We're here, Alfa.

786
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So, this is the hot one.

787
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Alfa, wait.

788
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Why?

789
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Why can't I?

790
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You see?

791
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
If you had passed him, you would feel the same.

792
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Alfa, we have to be careful.

793
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
This place is monitored by the Black Mantra.

794
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
We must not act recklessly.

795
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Finally.

796
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Finally, I can sit here.

797
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
From today,

798
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
no one can stop me in this school.

799
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Ankara?

800
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh, Purwa.

801
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
What is it, Purwa?

802
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Ankara.

803
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Why are you in Aldebaran's room?

804
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Where is he?

805
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Tell me.

806
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Purwa.

807
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Aldebaran has retired.

808
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And starting today,

809
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'm replacing him as the head of the magic school here.

810
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Retired?

811
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Impossible.

812
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That's impossible.

813
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
You're kidding.

814
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm not kidding, Purwa.

815
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
If you want the proof,

816
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
come here right now.

817
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:59,000
This is impossible.

818
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
He must be lying.

819
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Impossible.

820
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
What's that sound?

821
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:17,000
That's good.

822
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I think it's Purwa.

823
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
What's wrong?

824
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I'm tired of the head of the magic school.

825
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
What if he's trapped again?

826
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Let's go and see.

827
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Let's go.

828
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:42,000
What's that?

829
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Sir, thank you.

830
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I'm so happy.

831
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm the head of this school.

832
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:10,000
We can do it.

833
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So, how do we get out of here?

834
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
The only way...

835
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
to get out of here is a light.

836
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
A light that is so bright...

837
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
that it can destroy the magic school.

838
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The question is,

839
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
where do we get the light from?

840
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh, right.

841
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'll ask for help from Putri Bintang.

842
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Putri Bintang?

843
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Putri Bintang!

844
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Alfa?

845
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Hi, Alfa.

846
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
How did it go?

847
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It went well.

848
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Thank you for helping me.

849
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Can I ask for help again?

850
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Sure.

851
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm ready to help you.

852
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
What do you want?

853
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
If I can get the light...

854
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
to this building.

855
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Okay.

856
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Because your task is to get the light.

857
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So, get ready.

858
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
(Go, go, go)

859
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
(Reach all your dreams)

860
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
(Go, go, go)

861
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
(Never stop)

862
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
(Go, go, go)

863
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
(Fight with the power of your soul)

864
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
(Go, go, go)

865
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
(Make yourself)

866
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
(Go, go, go)

867
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
(Let's dream)

868
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
(Go, go, go)

869
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Thank you, Putri Bintang.

870
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Bintang!

871
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Yes, Alfa.

872
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
If you need anything, just call me.

873
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm ready to help you.

874
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Okay.

875
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Alfa.

876
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You're amazing.

877
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You can be friends with the stars.

878
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Not many people are like that.

879
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Okay.

880
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
But before that, let's try again.

881
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
(Go, go, go)

882
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
(Reach all your dreams)

883
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
(Go, go, go)

884
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
(Make yourself)

885
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
(Go, go, go)

886
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Did you make it?

887
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Yes.

888
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I think the black magic is gone.

889
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Mike, now...

890
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I'll plan to go inside.

891
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Okay.

892
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I'll be back.

893
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
(The black magic is gone)

894
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Where are you?

895
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
(The black magic is gone)

896
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Let's go home, Alfa.

897
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
The black magic is gone.

898
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Let's go home.

899
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
(The black magic is gone)

900
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I've been given a job.

901
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
How's your work there?

902
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Sir.

903
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Thank you, sir.

904
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I'm very happy, sir.

905
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Because starting today...

906
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I'm the one who will be the headmaster in this school, sir.

907
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
(The black magic is gone)

908
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Good.

909
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Sir.

910
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I went to far away.

911
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
But, the black magic is gone.

912
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
There's nothing wasted.

913
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Next time, we can come back.

914
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
The important thing now...

915
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
You have to be there.

916
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's Professor Poba.

917
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Why?

918
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
He was shouting.

919
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't know why.

920
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Professor Poba.

921
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Where are you going?

922
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:16,000
You're angry with the students.

923
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And now, you decide to leave.

924
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Because of me.

925
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Shut up, you.

926
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Now, there's a very serious situation in the school.

927
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I have to go home.

928
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And all of you have to go home now.

929
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
But, professor.

930
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Don't lie to me.

931
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I'm serious.

932
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You know.

933
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I contacted the school.

934
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I want to talk to the new headmaster.

935
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But, guess.

936
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Who am I talking to?

937
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Kara.

938
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Professor Kara.

939
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You go home with your parents.

940
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
What's wrong, sis?

941
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
The headmaster is in my hands now.

942
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And this means...

943
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I'm the official headmaster.

944
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
That's scary.

945
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Luckily, it's not a chicken.

946
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
If it's a chicken, I can peel it.

947
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I'm dead.

948
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Where's my money?

949
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm so lonely.

950
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:05,000
[music]

951
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,200
Jumping and racing stars

952
