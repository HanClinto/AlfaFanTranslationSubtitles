00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, run with courage

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Leon, this is the school you have to destroy

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You will join this school as one of its students

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And you will change your identity

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Your name is not Leon anymore

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But Rio, Leon, do you understand?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I understand, so this is the person who has betrayed my grandfather

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will destroy you both

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Come on, say goodbye to him

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Goodbye

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ah, how cute with a smile

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Professor Andepanat, I feel so relieved

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
With this dust

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Our school is now secure and safe

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Without any disturbance from the Angkara

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Not only that, Professor

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But in all the rooms in this school

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have put a sign

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If there is danger, a monster or an enemy comes

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The alarm will sound

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So there is no more story

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There are students or teachers who suddenly disappeared

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's very good, Professor

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What is that sound, Professor?

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's a sign of danger, I mean

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In the Purnama dormitory

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on, let's go there now

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Look at your left

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Professor Andepanat

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I thought the scariest thing was the family

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's him

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where is he?

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who?

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think we can't get out anymore

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If so, we have to attack more

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's go

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:58,000
[Music]

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
[Screaming]

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Purnama dormitory

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What's going on, Professor?

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why is it not open yet?

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's going on?

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They are smiling

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Kids, calm down

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The teachers are here

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The teachers will definitely save you, kids

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Professor, let's open it with magic

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Open it

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Weird, it's still not open yet

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's too late, Professor

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Kids

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Who attacked you?

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Karang?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm not Karang

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm Professor Andepanat

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
[Screaming]

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Calm down, kids

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We will definitely save you

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Calm down

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hang in there

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
[Screaming]

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Once the sword is sharpened

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The goat's body will fly

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Dear Queen Venus

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My students

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Prepare for the match tomorrow morning

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, sir

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
See you tomorrow

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's all, sir?

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The goat is not dead, sir

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes, sir

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's too ordinary

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The goat's body is not good, sir

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not sharp, sir

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is there anything else you want to say?

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's no queen

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's all, sir

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
[Phone ringing]

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If I lose

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have to give this box to them

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But am I willing to?

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
[Lightning]

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Queen Venus

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I am Batu Jiwa

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I remind you

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This box is very precious

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can't give it to them

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are...

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Batu Jiwa's spirit?

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I am

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Batu Jiwa's spirit

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Who broke this box?

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Today

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I will be the judge

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm so lucky

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
[Lightning]

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Whose footprints are these?

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
These footprints lead me to the lost body

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
[Lightning]

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh my God

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The horse's footprints are gone

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Banana!

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We are wrong, sir

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We are not the one who broke the box

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We are the one who broke the box

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We are not the one who broke the box

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't be afraid

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We will save him

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Get up!

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
One, two, three

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We are not afraid

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:55,000
[Lightning]

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let me try the meteorphone's spell, sir

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Meteorphone!

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll take it

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You better take it, sir

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let me go first

132
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
[Evil Laugh]

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is still a success, sir

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We are not the one who broke the box

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How is it, sir?

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's going on?

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The door can't be opened

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It seems like there's a power inside

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's go, guys!

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We are broken!

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
[Screaming]

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What?

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Our friends are fainted!

146
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's blow their noses

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So they can breathe

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Rika!

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Get her!

150
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Lita, get her!

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hurry!

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000

[Lightning]

155
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What should we do?

156
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What if the monster is not in there?

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
[Lightning]

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No!

[Lightning]

160
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's that?

161
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
[Screaming]

162
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's go!

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
[Screaming]

164
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's a black ghost!

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why is it so powerful?

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh, no!

167
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why is it so powerful to attack the monster?

168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
[Groaning]

169
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What's wrong?

170
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The monster is gone

171
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It seems like they are attacked

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let's attack the monster together

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't let it get away

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes, sir

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Power of the Five!

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
[Lightning]

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What's that?

178
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Rio!

179
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Professor, why is there a monster here?

180
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, professor

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
She's poisoned

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Poisoned?

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Alva, what happened?

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We are attacked by monsters

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We are all attacked by the monster

186
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
By the monster

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Alva!

188
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm going!

189
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank God, it's okay

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But...

191
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Whose footprints are these?

192
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Who's in here?

193
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's okay, what matters is you and me

194
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Me?

195
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What's happening?

196
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm going to be chased!

197
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Whoever it is, it managed to beat my horse

198
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And that means...

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It has a very high HP

200
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Even the prey managed to beat it

201
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Who is it?

202
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I have to be careful

203
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
[Lightning]

204
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Dr. Pertiwi must be shocked to see so many patients

205
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Ah, hi! You're smiling

206
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's right, Professor Agni

207
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I think we should immediately tighten security

208
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So that this disaster doesn't happen again

209
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay, then we'll bring the kids to the clinic

210
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes, professor

212
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Pertiwi!

213
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh my God!

214
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
OMG!

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh no, no, no, no

216
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What, what, what the...

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
These are all tests, victims!

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Pertiwi, quickly treat them!

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes, professor!

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Come on

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Teacher, you know that...

222
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is a serum for recovery

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Please, help me!

224
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Help me, pour it into their mouths

225
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go

226
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Pertiwi!

227
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Help Rio first, she's the most seriously injured

228
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh no, oh my God!

229
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, professor

230
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh my goodness!

231
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh professor, why is our school always attacked?

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why, professor?

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Pertiwi is sad

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
As you said, it's a disaster

235
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But just now, I realized

236
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And told me

237
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That Rio is the cause of this disaster

239
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sir

240
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How's the mission, sir?

241
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
All good?

242
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Mission accomplished, sir

243
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Aldebaran finally believes in Leon

244
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I mean, your prionel, sir

245
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Very good, Aldebaran

246
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Good

247
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Now, your job is to fight the protection prism

248
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But, how, sir?

249
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Every time I change to find myself

250
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I always get stuck, sir

251
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't be stupid, Aldebaran

252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Every mantra, there must be a weak point

253
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You look for a place that is not protected by the dust

254
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But, where, sir?

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Where?

256
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You look for it, I have to look for it too

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay, sir

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I want a banana

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You're a coward

260
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Who did this?

00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I want a banana

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000

I want a banana

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Before we fly

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We should do what is called warming up

277
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What is it?

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Warming up

They are so confident

293
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They don't know who we are

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's right

295
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The match will start soon

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Long live Nick

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So we can look cool

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What is this?

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
A stick

306
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You too?

307
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh my

308
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What should we do?

309
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We asked for a stick, but we got a stick

310
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Look, we are being betrayed

311
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Do I have one?

312
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You have one too

313
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You guys

314
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You are so weird sometimes

315
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You are so shy

316
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You are using wrong magic

317
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
No formal

318
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Come on

319
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Get ready, Nick

320
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Come on, Nick

Long live Nick

323
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You are just a kid, what can you do?

324
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Nick and Viru Batu Venus will go around this island three times

325
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The one who reaches the finish line first is the winner

326
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Come on, Nick

327
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Cheer up

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You can do it

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Keep chasing

335
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hurry up

336
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Come on, Viru Batu

337
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Come on, Nick

338
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Concentrate, Nick

339
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You can do it faster than Viru Batu

340
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That kid is not as strong as he looks

341
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hurry up

342
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Fly higher

343
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Keep chasing, Nick

344
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Come on, Nick

345
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Keep chasing

346
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You can do it

347
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm sure you can win

348
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That's why Viru Batu

349
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Don't underestimate the kids of the magic school

350
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I have to find a way to win

351
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Turns out my kid can't be considered as a queen

352
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Nick

353
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Be careful, Nick

354
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Watch out, Nick

355
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
She's so brave

356
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Turns out

357
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Even though the queen has a beautiful face

358
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
She's a coward

359
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Venus, back off

360
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm sorry

361
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But you can't beat my kid

362
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I have to find a way to win

363
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm sorry

364
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But you can't beat my kid

365
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm sorry

Kids

368
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
In an emergency

369
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Actually, lollipop can be made to fly

370
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But

371
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The result can be fatal

372
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Because it can damage your lollipop

373
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That's bad

374
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's a shame if it's damaged

375
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's very dangerous

376
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The mantra is

377
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Turbofan

378
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Daft Punk

379
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Turbofan

380
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So fast, Nick

381
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Faster than a rocket

382
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You have to win, Nick

383
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Come on, Nick

384
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You have to win, Nick

385
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Faster than a rocket

386
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Faster

387
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Come on, Nick

388
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You have to win, Nick

389
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Come on, Nick

390
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Faster

391
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah!

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We won!

393
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Great, Nick

394
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Last cut

395
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Adi Arati!

396
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh, my

397
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The beautiful Venus Queen

398
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We beg you

399
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Give me that soul

400
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The most beautiful woman in the world

401
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's okay

402
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I won't give you this

403
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You're so cruel

404
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Please be fair

405
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The boy is in the top

406
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The beautiful queen

407
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Turns out she likes to lie

408
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
She's lying

409
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Please be fair

410
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Listen

411
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If you want this necklace

412
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You have to fulfill one more requirement

413
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What is the last requirement that the Venus Queen wants?

414
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Pertiwi

415
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes, Prof

416
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
How is Rio?

417
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Rio is still out of consciousness

418
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But the others are all awake

419
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Amazing, right, Prof?

420
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Why is Rio the only one who's still unconscious?

421
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Vega

422
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Rio is already poisoned by the laba-laba

423
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
When we came in earlier

424
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You were all unconscious

425
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Only Rio can survive

426
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And she defeated the laba-laba

427
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's great

428
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
If you write a new one

429
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Rio will be so great

430
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Looks like the boy has become a hero

431
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh my God

432
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So sad

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
How can I repay you?

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm happy

435
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm tired, I'm dizzy

436
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Good night, Birbi

437
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Agni

438
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Tonight

439
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We'll have a party

440
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
For Rio

441
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yes, Prof

442
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry, dear

443
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Just leave us alone

444
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We can do it

445
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This place is so quiet

446
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
No one comes here

447
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Maybe the Venus Queen isn't here

448
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
No sign of the Venus Queen

449
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Maybe she's in the dark

450
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I did it

451
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The Valdebaran

452
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Is nothing to me

453
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm waiting for you

454
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Rio is fighting the laba-laba

455
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
With the matrix

456
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Who is she?

457
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Pegasus

458
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Vixor

459
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Where are you, Rio?

460
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm so scared

461
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:40,000
We did it

462
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Thank you, Rio

463
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Thank you for saving us

464
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thank you

465
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Rio

466
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You did a great job

467
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And you

468
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Will hold an event

469
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
To give away medals to you

470
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's too much

471
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What I did

472
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Was nothing special

473
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Thank you, Rio

474
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Thank you

475
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Say thank you to Rio

476
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Thank you, Rio

477
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Alva

478
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Please take the drinks from that table

479
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Why do I hear a voice?

480
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Alva

481
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Don't

482
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If you look at me again

483
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'll be

484
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What?

485
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Alva

486
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Why did Alva leave?

487
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Of course

488
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Alva is jealous

489
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Of Rio

490
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Who is now

491
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
A total loser

492
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Right?

493
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Of course

494
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Alva

495
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You lost to Rio

496
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Right?

497
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Alva is not that kind of person

498
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
She's a good girl

499
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I know

500
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You're so mean, Miri

501
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I know

502
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Enough

503
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's go

504
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Let's go to Alva

505
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's go

506
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
(Alva is not that kind of person)

507
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Alva

508
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What is she doing?

509
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Alva

510
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What are you doing?

511
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Running around the clinic

512
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Don't you know?

513
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Alva looks confused

514
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I know

515
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Did you hear that?

516
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The professor is coming

517
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
No

518
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What?

519
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I heard it

520
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You're kidding

521
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes

522
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The professor can't come to school

523
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's why I want to check

524
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
If it's true or not

525
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But it's not possible

526
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's not possible

527
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Alva

Ray

529
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm not lying

530
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What are you doing?

531
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I want to find her and meet her

532
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Do you want to come?

533
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
If you don't want to come

534
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Go to the clinic

535
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Take care of Rio

536
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Alva

537
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
She's so annoying

538
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
She's so annoying to Rio

539
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Because she wants to be a hero

540
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I know

541
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Don't you know Alva?

542
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
She's your friend

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I know

544
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't like her

545
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Just kidding

546
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Alva's friend

547
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I heard a voice from here

548
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Where is it?

549
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Maybe it's inside

but she's in a bad mood.

785
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Hi, beautiful girl.

786
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Can you help me?

787
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
What do you want me to do?

788
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Let me be clear.

789
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I'm confused.

790
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm so confused.

791
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
With your queen's challenge,

792
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
which is to turn the fabric into red.

793
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Please, help me.

794
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Give me a clue.

795
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
How can the fabric turn into red?

796
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Fabric is the queen's wish.

797
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
No one has ever turned the fabric into red.

798
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It's our fault.

799
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Just give up.

800
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Because any effort is useless.

801
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Give up?

802
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Useless?

803
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Traveling to the north,

804
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
wearing a red hat,

805
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
called Megantara.

806
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I don't know what giving up means.

807
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I will keep fighting,

808
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
finding a way to turn the fabric into red,

809
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
like Queen Venus' wish.

810
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And I will succeed.

811
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I will not give up.

812
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Okay, just try.

813
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Do you want me to try?

814
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I will not give up.

815
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But how?

816
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
How?

817
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I thought about it,

818
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
now I'm hungry.

819
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But if I'm hungry, there's no food here.

820
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'm eating while watching the dance.

821
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
When I'm hungry, there's durian.

822
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm hungry.

823
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Durian!

824
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Eat durian!

825
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
There's a goat.

826
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Who is that goat?

827
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Is the goat asking for durian?

828
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Since when does a goat eat durian?

829
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's really angry.

830
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Be patient.

831
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I want durian. Just eat it.

832
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Eat it.

833
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I want durian.

834
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Eat it.

835
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I want durian.

836
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Eat it.

837
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I want durian.

838
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Eat it.

839
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
That goat is really angry.

840
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
What are you doing?

841
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I don't understand.

842
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What do you mean?

843
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You're the one who attacked the goat using the mantra.

844
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I heard it.

845
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I didn't say that mantra.

846
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I just learned the mantra from the mantra teacher.

847
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That's all.

848
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Are you sure that he said that mantra?

849
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
If not, you're lying.

850
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm not lying.

851
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I heard it.

852
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But you were still unconscious.

853
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
How could you see it?

854
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I wasn't unconscious.

855
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I heard it.

856
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Alva.

857
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You don't have to be jealous.

858
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You have a lot of power.

859
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Don't be jealous.

860
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I'm jealous.

861
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You're not jealous.

862
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Alva, calm down.

863
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Even though he's great, we're still your friends.

864
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Right?

865
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I'm not jealous.

866
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You don't trust me, right?

867
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Stop fighting.

868
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Alva, don't be jealous.

869
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I didn't mean it.

870
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't want to be a hero.

871
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Or anything.

872
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I just want to fight the goats.

873
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So, we can be safe.

874
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
If not, we'll die.

875
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm so proud of you.

876
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
How about we switch partners?

877
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Me and Rio.

878
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You and Alva.

879
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't want to.

880
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
My sister chose Alva.

881
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I want to be with Rio.

882
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
We're twins.

883
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We should share everything.

884
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I agree.

885
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
But, I don't think you're that great.

886
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I'm so jealous of you.

887
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Let's find someone else.

888
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Let's go.

889
00:57:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
"Alva and Rio"

890
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:56,000
That person again.

891
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
"Alva and Rio"

892
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Harimau, what happened to you?

893
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I told you to take care of this pig.

894
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Not a date.

895
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
He's even more fierce.

896
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You're so mean.

897
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
"Alva and Rio"

898
00:59:43,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Alva.

899
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Rio.

900
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
"Alva and Rio"

901
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:24,000
A mask to protect your skin.

902
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Who dares to do this?

903
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Making a mask out of peanuts.

904
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I have an idea.

905
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:03,000
"Alva and Rio"

906
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Nik, Riceh, Ari, Oktav.

907
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Help me.

908
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
What's wrong?

909
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Look for a cloth or a bandage.

910
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
He's in so much pain. What's wrong?

911
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I met a goat.

912
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
A wild goat that doesn't know how to speak.

913
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's a basic. It must be at school.

914
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But the goat is okay, right?

915
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Goat?

916
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Hurry up and find a cloth or a bandage.

917
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I almost broke my kid.

918
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Okay, wait.

919
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I'm out of cloth.

920
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Slowly.

921
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Okay.

922
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Thank you, Nik.

923
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You're welcome.

924
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm going to rest.

925
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
He's out of the house.

926
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
He's looking for inspiration.

927
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
He met a goat.

928
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's so good.

929
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It doesn't know how to speak.

930
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's a bad luck.

931
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
What?

932
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
What's wrong, soldier?

933
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Where's the cloth?

934
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It's gone.

935
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Where is it?

936
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I don't know.

937
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Why is it gone?

938
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Don't.

939
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Don't say that, soldier.

940
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
The cloth is in his hand.

941
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It's true, soldier.

942
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Because he's bleeding, he's changing his color.

943
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It's turning red.

944
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Red?

945
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yes, red.

946
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It means...

947
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This white cloth...

948
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Can turn red...

949
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
If...

950
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's touched by...

951
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The goat.

952
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
We've solved the problem.

953
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
We need blood.

954
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
If so, just hurt the soldier's hand.

955
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's true.

956
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It'll turn red.

957
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The soldier is bleeding.

958
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I'm going to die.

959
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Kids.

960
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Today, I'm going to teach you...

961
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
How to make a love potion.

962
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But before that, I want to ask you.

963
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Does anyone know what love potion is?

964
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Rio, you answer.

965
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Love potion is...

966
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
A magic potion.

967
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
So, the person who drinks it...

968
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Will fall in love with the person who gives it to them.

969
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
You're so smart, Rio.

970
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Since it's Valentine's Day...

971
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm sure there are many kids...

972
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Who want to make a love potion.

973
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm here...

974
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
To teach you how to make a love potion.

975
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
How to make a love potion?

976
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
How?

977
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
How to turn the white cloth into red using blood?

978
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We've used a lot of soldiers, but it's still not enough.

979
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Even the anime...

980
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
We can't make it.

981
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Really?

982
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Made from brown beans.

983
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I have an idea.

984
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Buy cheap clothes in Jeparang.

985
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
What's your idea, soldier?

986
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You can help us.

987
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Are you ready?

988
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Come.

989
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Get ready.

990
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,000
The Phantom Camera.

991
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
What is that camera for?

992
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
For selfie?

993
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's not the time yet.

994
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
You're so slow.

995
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
This is not a regular camera.

996
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
This is a double camera.

997
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It can double the object in the photo.

998
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Oh, my.

999
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
What's the connection with this cloth, soldier?

1000
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Do you know what it's called?

1001
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You're so slow.

1002
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It takes a long time to load.

1003
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Look.

1004
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It's double.

1005
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Wait a minute.

1006
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's triple.

1007
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
There.

1008
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
There are many.

1009
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Look.

1010
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's red.

1011
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
The cloth is red.

1012
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It's amazing.

1013
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
All the cloth from Venus.

1014
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
All of them are red.

1015
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's amazing, soldier.

1016
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's amazing.

1017
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
You don't know yet.

1018
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Megantara is amazing.

1019
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Soldier.

1020
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The camera is amazing.

1021
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Now, the ingredients are in front of you.

1022
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
The ingredients are paprika.

1023
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Centaurus' sweat.

1024
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And a bit of turmeric.

1025
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Now, if you stir the ingredients three times clockwise.

1026
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You will get a pink liquid.

1027
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Let's try it.

1028
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Pink. Let's try it.

1029
01:07:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
[Pink liquid]

1030
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Alva?

1031
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You failed. Try again.

1032
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Okay.

1033
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:13,000
What did you make?

1034
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:29,000
[Pink liquid]

1035
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Vega?

1036
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
You failed.

1037
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Try again.

1038
01:09:38,000 --> 01:10:09,000
[Pink liquid]

1039
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Rionelo.

1040
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You made it.

1041
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You're amazing.

1042
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Guys.

1043
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Rionelo made it.

1044
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Let's give him a big hand.

1045
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Vega.

1046
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Usually, you can make a mess.

1047
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Why did you fail this time?

1048
01:10:29,000 --> 01:11:14,000
[Pink liquid]

1049
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
What's that?

1050
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What are you doing?

1051
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
There's no poison.

1052
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I'm not doing anything.

1053
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You're the one who's bad.

1054
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:56,000
[Pink liquid]

1055
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:21,000
[Go Go Go song]

1056
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Remember to look at your promises to the people, not the government.
