 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, run with courage

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Leon, this is the school you have to destroy

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You will join this school as one of its students

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And you will change your identity

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Your name is not Leon anymore

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 But Rio, Leon, do you understand?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I understand, so this is the person who has betrayed my grandfather

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I will destroy you both

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Come on, say goodbye to him

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Goodbye

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Ah, how cute with a smile

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Professor Andepanat, I feel so relieved

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 With this dust

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Our school is now secure and safe

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Without any disturbance from the Angkara

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Not only that, Professor

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 But in all the rooms in this school

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I have put a sign

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 If there is danger, a monster or an enemy comes

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 The alarm will sound

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So there is no more story

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 There are students or teachers who suddenly disappeared

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 That's very good, Professor

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 What is that sound, Professor?

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 That's a sign of danger, I mean

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 In the Purnama dormitory

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Come on, let's go there now

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Come on

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Look at your left

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Professor Andepanat

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Professor Andepanat

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Professor Andepanat

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Professor Andepanat

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Professor Andepanat

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Professor Andepanat

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Professor Andepanat

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I thought the scariest thing was the family

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It's him

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Where is he?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Who?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I think we can't get out anymore

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 If so, we have to attack more

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Let's go

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 [Music]

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Purnama dormitory

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 What's going on, Professor?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Why is it not open yet?

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 What's going on?

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 They are smiling

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Kids, calm down

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The teachers are here

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 The teachers will definitely save you, kids

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Professor, let's open it with magic

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Open it

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Weird, it's still not open yet

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It's too late, Professor

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Kids

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Who attacked you?

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Karang?

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I'm not Karang

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I'm Professor Andepanat

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 [Screaming]

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Calm down, kids

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 We will definitely save you

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Calm down

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Hang in there

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Hang in there

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000

 [Screaming]

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Once the sword is sharpened

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 The goat's body will fly

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Dear Queen Venus

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 My students

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Prepare for the match tomorrow morning

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Okay, sir

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 See you tomorrow

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 That's all, sir?

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 The goat is not dead, sir

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Yes, sir

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 It's too ordinary

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 The goat's body is not good, sir

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 It's not sharp, sir

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Is there anything else you want to say?

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 There's no queen

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 That's all, sir

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Thank you

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Let's go

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 [Phone ringing]

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 If I lose

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I have to give this box to them

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 But am I willing to?

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 [Lightning]

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:07,000

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 I am Batu Jiwa

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I remind you

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 This box is very precious

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You can't give it to them

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 You are...

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Batu Jiwa's spirit?

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 That's right

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I am

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Batu Jiwa's spirit

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Who broke this box?

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Today

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I will be the judge

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I'm so lucky

 [Lightning]

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Whose footprints are these?

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 These footprints lead me to the lost body

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 [Lightning]

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Oh my God

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 The horse's footprints are gone

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 We are wrong, sir

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 We are not the one who broke the box

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 We are the one who broke the box

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 We are not the one who broke the box

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Don't be afraid

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Don't be afraid

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 We will save him

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Get up!

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 One, two, three

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 We are not afraid

 This is still a success, sir

 We are not the one who broke the box

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 How is it, sir?

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 What's going on?

 The door can't be opened

 That's right

 Our friends are fainted!

 Let's blow their noses

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 So they can breathe

 Why is it so powerful?

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Oh, no!

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Why is it so powerful to attack the monster?

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 [Groaning]

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 What's wrong?

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 The monster is gone

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It seems like they are attacked

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Let's attack the monster together

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Don't let it get away

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Yes, sir

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Power of the Five!

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 [Lightning]

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 What's that?

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 What's that?

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Rio!

211
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Rio!

212
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Professor, why is there a monster here?

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Yes, professor

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 She's poisoned

215
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Poisoned?

216
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Alva, what happened?

217
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 We are attacked by monsters

218
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 We are all attacked by the monster

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 By the monster

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Alva!

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Alva!

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I'm going!

223
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Thank God, it's okay

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But...

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Whose footprints are these?

226
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Who's in here?

227
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Who's in here?

228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 It's okay, what matters is you and me

229
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Me?

230
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 What's happening?

231
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I'm going to be chased!

232
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Whoever it is, it managed to beat my horse

233
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And that means...

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 It has a very high HP

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Even the prey managed to beat it

236
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Who is it?

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I have to be careful

238
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 [Lightning]

239
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Dr. Pertiwi must be shocked to see so many patients

240
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Ah, hi! You're smiling

241
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 That's right, Professor Agni

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I think we should immediately tighten security

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 So that this disaster doesn't happen again

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Okay, then we'll bring the kids to the clinic

245
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Yes, professor

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 [Music]

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Pertiwi!

248
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Pertiwi!

249
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Oh my God!

250
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 OMG!

251
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Oh no, no, no, no

252
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 What, what, what the...

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 These are all tests, victims!

254
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Pertiwi, quickly treat them!

255
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Yes, professor!

256
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Come on

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Teacher, you know that...

258
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 This is a serum for recovery

259
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Please, help me!

260
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Help me, pour it into their mouths

261
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Go, go, go, go, go, go

262
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Pertiwi!

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Help Rio first, she's the most seriously injured

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Oh no, oh my God!

265
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Yes, professor

266
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Oh my goodness!

267
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Oh professor, why is our school always attacked?

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Why, professor?

269
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Pertiwi is sad

270
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 As you said, it's a disaster

271
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 But just now, I realized

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And told me

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 That Rio is the cause of this disaster

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 [Music]

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Sir

276
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 How's the mission, sir?

277
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 All good?

278
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Mission accomplished, sir

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Aldebaran finally believes in Leon

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I mean, your prionel, sir

281
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Very good, Aldebaran

282
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Good

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Now, your job is to fight the protection prism

284
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 But, how, sir?

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Every time I change to find myself

286
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I always get stuck, sir

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Don't be stupid, Aldebaran

288
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Every mantra, there must be a weak point

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 You look for a place that is not protected by the dust

290
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 But, where, sir?

291
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Where?

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 You look for it, I have to look for it too

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Okay, sir

294
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 I want a banana

295
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I want a banana

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 You're a coward

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Who did this?

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I want a banana

299
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I want a banana

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I want a banana

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I want a banana

302
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Banana, banana

303
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I want a banana

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Find it yourself

 Keep this powder well

311
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Don't let it get in there again

312
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000

 Painting of a tiger

314
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Last, Aldebaran

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Before we fly

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 We should do what is called warming up

317
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 What is it?

318
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Warming up

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Okay, ready

320
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000

 Viru Batu Venus

331
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Eat the strawberry, buy it with the jackfruit

332
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Delicious

333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 They are so confident

334
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 They don't know who we are

335
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 That's right

336
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 The match will start soon

337
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000

339
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Come on, cheer up for Nick

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Long live Nick

 Taf, bring out all the bling bling magic

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So we can look cool

343
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Okay

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Patan, come here

345
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 What is this?

346
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 A stick

347
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 You too?

348
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Oh my

349
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 What should we do?

350
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 We asked for a stick, but we got a stick

351
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Look, we are being betrayed

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Do I have one?

353
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 You have one too

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 You guys

355
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 You are so weird sometimes

356
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You are so shy

357
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 You are using wrong magic

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 No formal

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Come on

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Get ready, Nick

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 You are just a kid, what can you do?

366
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Nick and Viru Batu Venus will go around this island three times

367
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 The one who reaches the finish line first is the winner

368
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Come on, Nick

369
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Cheer up

 Come on, Nick

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Concentrate, Nick

383
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 You can do it faster than Viru Batu

384
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 That kid is not as strong as he looks

385
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Hurry up

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Fly higher

387
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Keep chasing, Nick

388
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Come on, Nick

389
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Keep chasing

390
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You can do it

391
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 I'm sure you can win

392
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That's why Viru Batu

393
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Don't underestimate the kids of the magic school

394
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I have to find a way to win

395
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Turns out my kid can't be considered as a queen

396
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Nick

397
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Be careful, Nick

398
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Watch out, Nick

399
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 She's so brave

400
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Turns out

401
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Even though the queen has a beautiful face

402
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 She's a coward

403
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Venus, back off

404
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 I'm sorry

405
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 But you can't beat my kid

406
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I have to find a way to win

407
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 I'm sorry

408
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But you can't beat my kid

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 I'm sorry

410
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I have to find a way to win

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Kids

412
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 In an emergency

413
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Actually, lollipop can be made to fly

414
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 But

415
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 The result can be fatal

416
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Because it can damage your lollipop

417
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 That's bad

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It's a shame if it's damaged

419
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 It's very dangerous

420
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 The mantra is

421
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Turbofan

422
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Daft Punk

423
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Turbofan

424
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 So fast, Nick

425
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Faster than a rocket

426
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 You have to win, Nick

427
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Come on, Nick

428
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 You have to win, Nick

429
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Faster than a rocket

430
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Faster

431
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Come on, Nick

432
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 You have to win, Nick

433
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Come on, Nick

434
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Faster

435
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Yeah!

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 We won!

437
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 We won!

438
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 We won!

439
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Great, Nick

440
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Last cut

441
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Adi Arati!

442
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Oh, my

443
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 The beautiful Venus Queen

444
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 We beg you

445
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Give me that soul

446
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 The most beautiful woman in the world

447
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 It's okay

448
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 I won't give you this

449
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 You're so cruel

450
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Please be fair

451
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 The boy is in the top

452
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 The beautiful queen

453
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Turns out she likes to lie

454
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 She's lying

455
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Please be fair

456
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Listen

457
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 If you want this necklace

458
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 You have to fulfill one more requirement

459
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 What is the last requirement that the Venus Queen wants?

460
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Pertiwi

461
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Yes, Prof

462
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 How is Rio?

463
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Rio is still out of consciousness

464
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 But the others are all awake

465
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Amazing, right, Prof?

466
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Why is Rio the only one who's still unconscious?

467
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Vega

468
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Rio is already poisoned by the laba-laba

469
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 When we came in earlier

470
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 You were all unconscious

471
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Only Rio can survive

472
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And she defeated the laba-laba

473
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 That's great

474
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 If you write a new one

475
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Rio will be so great

476
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Looks like the boy has become a hero

477
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Oh my God

478
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 So sad

479
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 How can I repay you?

480
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I'm happy

481
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 I'm tired, I'm dizzy

482
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Good night, Birbi

483
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Agni

484
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Tonight

485
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 We'll have a party

486
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 For Rio

487
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Yes, Prof

488
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I'm sorry, dear

489
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Just leave us alone

490
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 We can do it

491
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 We can do it

492
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 This place is so quiet

493
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 No one comes here

494
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Maybe the Venus Queen isn't here

495
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 No sign of the Venus Queen

496
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Maybe she's in the dark

497
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I did it

498
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 The Valdebaran

499
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Is nothing to me

500
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 I'm waiting for you

501
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Rio is fighting the laba-laba

502
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 With the matrix

503
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Who is she?

504
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Pegasus

505
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Pegasus

506
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Vixor

507
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Vixor

508
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Vixor

509
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Where are you, Rio?

510
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I'm so scared

511
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 I'm so scared

512
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I'm so scared

513
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 We did it

514
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 We did it

515
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 We did it

516
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 We did it

517
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Thank you, Rio

518
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Thank you for saving us

519
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Thank you

520
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Rio

521
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 You did a great job

522
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And you

523
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Will hold an event

524
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 To give away medals to you

525
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 That's too much

526
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 What I did

527
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Was nothing special

528
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Thank you, Rio

529
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Thank you

530
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Say thank you to Rio

531
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Thank you, Rio

532
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Alva

533
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Alva

534
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Please take the drinks from that table

535
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Why do I hear a voice?

536
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Alva

537
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Alva

538
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Alva

539
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Alva

540
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Alva

541
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Don't

542
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 If you look at me again

543
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 I'll be

544
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 What?

545
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Alva

546
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Why did Alva leave?

547
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Of course

548
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Alva is jealous

549
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Of Rio

550
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Who is now

551
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 A total loser

552
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Right?

553
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Of course

554
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Alva

555
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 You lost to Rio

556
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Right?

557
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Alva is not that kind of person

558
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 She's a good girl

559
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 I know

560
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 You're so mean, Miri

561
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 I know

562
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Enough

563
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Let's go

564
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Let's go to Alva

565
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Let's go

566
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 (Alva is not that kind of person)

567
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Alva

568
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Alva

569
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Alva

570
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Alva

571
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 What is she doing?

572
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Alva

573
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 What are you doing?

574
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Running around the clinic

575
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Don't you know?

576
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Alva looks confused

577
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 I know

578
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Did you hear that?

579
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 The professor is coming

580
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 No

581
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 What?

582
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 I heard it

583
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 You're kidding

584
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Yes

585
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 The professor can't come to school

586
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 That's why I want to check

587
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 If it's true or not

588
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 But it's not possible

589
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 It's Vega.

790
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 I'll go back to the dorm.

791
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 It's sick!

792
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 He doesn't know what's inside the sim.

793
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 I have to go to the toilet.

794
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 What should we do?

795
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 We've tried everything.

796
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 But this cloth doesn't change into red.

797
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 It's a waste.

798
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 Should we just give up?

799
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 No.

800
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 If we give up, how are we going to get the box?

801
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Oh, no.

802
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 It's so easy.

803
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 The queen is so cunning.

804
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Wait.

805
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Where are you going?

806
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 I'm going to make a salad.

807
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 I'm going to get some inspiration.

808
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 Rio! Rio!

809
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Rio, you're done.

810
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 I'm proud of you.

811
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 He's our leader.

812
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 Yes.

813
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 Yes, Din.

814
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Get ready for the next lesson.

815
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Rio! Rio!

816
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 Wow, it's so beautiful.

817
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 Do you like it?

818
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 If you like it, you can have it.

819
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 I'm fighting against the bad guys.

820
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 I'm fighting for our safety.

821
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 Not for the medal.

822
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 Wow, that's so cute.

823
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 We're so proud of you.

824
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 It's so hard to make you happy.

825
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Rio, congratulations.

826
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 Where did you learn to be a medalist?

827
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 This is the medal.

828
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Yes, I saw it.

829
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 So, I want to say congratulations.

830
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 You're welcome.

831
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 Can I say something?

832
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 Sure.

833
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Where did you learn to do a magic trick?

834
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 Magic trick?

835
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Yes, magic trick.

836
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 You beat the bad guys with magic trick, right?

837
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 It's black magic.

838
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 [The next episode]

839
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 Are you sure Rio said the magic trick?

840
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 If not, you're dead.

841
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000

 [The next episode]

843
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 [The next episode]

844
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 Inspiration.

845
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 Inspiration.

846
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 Come on, I'm confused.

847
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 If there's a magic that can inspire me,

848
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 there must be a way out.

849
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 To turn the fabric into red, like Queen Venus' wish.

850
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 Hi.

851
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 Hi, sir.

852
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Why are you calling me sir?

853
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 Did you forget who I am?

854
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Yes, I'm Megantara.

855
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Megantara.

856
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 Can I give you a hand?

857
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Sure.

858
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 There's a beautiful girl,

859
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 but she's in a bad mood.

860
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 Hi, beautiful girl.

861
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 Can you help me?

862
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 What do you want me to do?

863
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 Let me be clear.

864
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 I'm confused.

865
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 I'm so confused.

866
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 With your queen's challenge,

867
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 which is to turn the fabric into red.

868
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Please, help me.

869
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 Give me a clue.

870
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 How can the fabric turn into red?

871
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 Fabric is the queen's wish.

872
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 No one has ever turned the fabric into red.

873
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 It's our fault.

874
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 Just give up.

875
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 Because any effort is useless.

876
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 Give up?

877
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 Useless?

878
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Traveling to the north,

879
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 wearing a red hat,

880
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 called Megantara.

881
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 I don't know what giving up means.

882
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 I will keep fighting,

883
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 finding a way to turn the fabric into red,

884
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 like Queen Venus' wish.

885
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 And I will succeed.

886
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 I will not give up.

887
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 Okay, just try.

888
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 Do you want me to try?

889
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 I will not give up.

890
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 But how?

891
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 How?

892
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 I thought about it,

893
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 now I'm hungry.

894
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 But if I'm hungry, there's no food here.

895
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 I'm eating while watching the dance.

896
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 When I'm hungry, there's durian.

897
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 I'm hungry.

898
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 Durian!

899
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 Eat durian!

900
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 Eat durian!

901
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 Eat durian!

902
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 There's a goat.

903
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 Who is that goat?

904
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 Is the goat asking for durian?

905
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 Since when does a goat eat durian?

906
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 It's really angry.

907
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 Be patient.

908
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 I want durian. Just eat it.

909
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 Eat it.

910
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 Eat it.

911
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 I want durian.

912
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 Eat it.

913
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 Eat it.

914
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 I want durian.

915
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 Eat it.

916
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 Eat it.

917
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 Eat it.

918
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 Eat it.

919
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 I want durian.

920
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 Eat it.

921
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 Eat it.

922
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 Eat it.

923
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 Eat it.

924
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 That goat is really angry.

925
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 What are you doing?

926
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 I don't understand.

927
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 What do you mean?

928
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 You're the one who attacked the goat using the mantra.

929
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 I heard it.

930
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 I didn't say that mantra.

931
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 I just learned the mantra from the mantra teacher.

932
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 That's all.

933
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 Are you sure that he said that mantra?

934
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 If not, you're lying.

935
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 I'm not lying.

936
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 I heard it.

937
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 But you were still unconscious.

938
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 How could you see it?

939
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 I wasn't unconscious.

940
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 I heard it.

941
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
 Alva.

942
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 You don't have to be jealous.

943
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 You have a lot of power.

944
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 Don't be jealous.

945
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 I'm jealous.

946
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 You're not jealous.

947
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 Alva, calm down.

948
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 Even though he's great, we're still your friends.

949
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 Right?

950
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 I'm not jealous.

951
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 You don't trust me, right?

952
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 Stop fighting.

953
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 Alva, don't be jealous.

954
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 I didn't mean it.

955
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 I don't want to be a hero.

956
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Or anything.

957
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 I just want to fight the goats.

958
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 So, we can be safe.

959
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 If not, we'll die.

960
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 I'm so proud of you.

961
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 How about we switch partners?

962
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 Me and Rio.

963
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 You and Alva.

964
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 I don't want to.

965
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 My sister chose Alva.

966
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 I want to be with Rio.

967
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 We're twins.

968
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 We should share everything.

969
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 I agree.

970
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 But, I don't think you're that great.

971
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
 I'm so jealous of you.

972
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 Let's find someone else.

973
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 Let's go.

974
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 "Alva and Rio"

975
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
 "Alva and Rio"

976
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 "Alva and Rio"

977
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 "Alva and Rio"

978
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 "Alva and Rio"

979
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
 "Alva and Rio"

980
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 "Alva and Rio"

981
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
 "Alva and Rio"

982
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 "Alva and Rio"

983
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 "Alva and Rio"

984
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 "Alva and Rio"

985
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 "Alva and Rio"

986
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 "Alva and Rio"

987
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 "Alva and Rio"

988
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 That person again.

989
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 "Alva and Rio"

990
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:13,000
 Harimau, what happened to you?

991
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 I told you to take care of this pig.

992
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 Not a date.

993
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
 He's even more fierce.

994
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 You're so mean.

995
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 "Alva and Rio"

996
00:59:43,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 Alva.

997
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
 Rio.

998
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 "Alva and Rio"

999
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 A mask to protect your skin.

1000
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 Who dares to do this?

1001
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 Making a mask out of peanuts.

1002
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
 I have an idea.

1003
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 "Alva and Rio"

1004
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 "Alva and Rio"

1005
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 Nik, Riceh, Ari, Oktav.

1006
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 Help me.

1007
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 What's wrong?

1008
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
 Look for a cloth or a bandage.

1009
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
 He's in so much pain. What's wrong?

1010
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 I met a goat.

1011
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 A wild goat that doesn't know how to speak.

1012
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 It's a basic. It must be at school.

1013
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 But the goat is okay, right?

1014
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
 Goat?

1015
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 Hurry up and find a cloth or a bandage.

1016
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 I almost broke my kid.

1017
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
 Okay, wait.

1018
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
 I'm out of cloth.

1019
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:55,000
 Slowly.

1020
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
 Okay.

1021
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 Thank you, Nik.

1022
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 You're welcome.

1023
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 I'm going to rest.

1024
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 He's out of the house.

1025
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 He's looking for inspiration.

1026
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 He met a goat.

1027
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 It's so good.

1028
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 It doesn't know how to speak.

1029
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
 It's a bad luck.

1030
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 What?

1031
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 What?

1032
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 What's wrong, soldier?

1033
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 Where's the cloth?

1034
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 It's gone.

1035
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 Where is it?

1036
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 I don't know.

1037
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
 Why is it gone?

1038
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 Don't.

1039
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 Don't say that, soldier.

1040
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 The cloth is in his hand.

1041
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 It's true, soldier.

1042
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
 Because he's bleeding, he's changing his color.

1043
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 It's turning red.

1044
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
 Red?

1045
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
 Yes, red.

1046
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
 It means...

1047
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 This white cloth...

1048
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 Can turn red...

1049
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
 If...

1050
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
 It's touched by...

1051
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
 The goat.

1052
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
 We've solved the problem.

1053
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 We need blood.

1054
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 If so, just hurt the soldier's hand.

1055
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 It's true.

1056
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 It'll turn red.

1057
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 The soldier is bleeding.

1058
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 I'm going to die.

1059
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 Kids.

1060
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 Today, I'm going to teach you...

1061
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
 How to make a love potion.

1062
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 But before that, I want to ask you.

1063
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 Does anyone know what love potion is?

1064
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 Rio, you answer.

1065
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
 Love potion is...

1066
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
 A magic potion.

1067
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
 So, the person who drinks it...

1068
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
 Will fall in love with the person who gives it to them.

1069
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
 You're so smart, Rio.

1070
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
 Since it's Valentine's Day...

1071
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 I'm sure there are many kids...

1072
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
 Who want to make a love potion.

1073
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 I'm here...

1074
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 To teach you how to make a love potion.

1075
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 How to make a love potion?

1076
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
 How?

1077
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 How to turn the white cloth into red using blood?

1078
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 We've used a lot of soldiers, but it's still not enough.

1079
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 Even the anime...

1080
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
 We can't make it.

1081
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
 Really?

1082
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 Made from brown beans.

1083
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
 I have an idea.

1084
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 Buy cheap clothes in Jeparang.

1085
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
 What's your idea, soldier?

1086
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 You can help us.

1087
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
 Are you ready?

1088
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,000
 Come.

1089
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
 Get ready.

1090
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 The Phantom Camera.

1091
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 What is that camera for?

1092
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 For selfie?

1093
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 It's not the time yet.

1094
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 You're so slow.

1095
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 This is not a regular camera.

1096
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 This is a double camera.

1097
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
 It can double the object in the photo.

1098
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 Oh, my.

1099
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 What's the connection with this cloth, soldier?

1100
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 Do you know what it's called?

1101
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 You're so slow.

1102
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
 It takes a long time to load.

1103
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 Look.

1104
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 It's double.

1105
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
 Wait a minute.

1106
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
 It's triple.

1107
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 There.

1108
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 There are many.

1109
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
 Look.

1110
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 It's red.

1111
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
 The cloth is red.

1112
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
 It's amazing.

1113
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 All the cloth from Venus.

1114
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 All of them are red.

1115
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
 It's amazing, soldier.

1116
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 It's amazing.

1117
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
 You don't know yet.

1118
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 Megantara is amazing.

1119
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
 Soldier.

1120
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
 The camera is amazing.

1121
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 Now, the ingredients are in front of you.

1122
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 The ingredients are paprika.

1123
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
 Centaurus' sweat.

1124
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
 And a bit of turmeric.

1125
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 Now, if you stir the ingredients three times clockwise.

1126
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 You will get a pink liquid.

1127
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 Let's try it.

1128
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 Pink. Let's try it.

1129
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 [Pink liquid]

1130
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:53,000
 [Pink liquid]

1131
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:04,000
 [Pink liquid]

1132
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:14,000
 [Pink liquid]

1133
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:24,000
 [Pink liquid]

1134
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:39,000
 [Pink liquid]

1135
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
 [Pink liquid]

1136
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 Alva?

1137
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 You failed. Try again.

1138
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
 Okay.

1139
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:13,000
 What did you make?

1140
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 [Pink liquid]

1141
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 [Pink liquid]

1142
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
 [Pink liquid]

1143
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
 Vega?

1144
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
 You failed.

1145
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
 Try again.

1146
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 [Pink liquid]

1147
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 [Pink liquid]

1148
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:09,000
 [Pink liquid]

1149
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
 Rionelo.

1150
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 You made it.

1151
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
 You're amazing.

1152
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
 Guys.

1153
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
 Rionelo made it.

1154
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 Let's give him a big hand.

1155
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
 Vega.

1156
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
 Usually, you can make a mess.

1157
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
 Why did you fail this time?

1158
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
 [Pink liquid]

1159
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:49,000
 [Pink liquid]

1160
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
 [Pink liquid]

1161
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:05,000
 [Pink liquid]

1162
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
 [Pink liquid]

1163
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
 [Pink liquid]

1164
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
 What's that?

1165
