Leon, this is the school you have to destroy

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You will join this school as one of its students

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And you will change your identity

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Your name is not Leon anymore

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But Rio, Leon, do you understand?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I understand, so this is the person who has betrayed my grandfather

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will destroy you both

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Come on, say goodbye to him

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Goodbye

Ah, how cute with a smile

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Professor Andepanat, I feel so relieved

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
With this dust

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Our school is now secure and safe

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Without any disturbance from the Angkara

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Not only that, Professor

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But in all the rooms in this school

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have put a sign

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If there is danger, a monster or an enemy comes

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The alarm will sound

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So there is no more story

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There are students or teachers who suddenly disappeared

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's very good, Professor

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What is that sound, Professor?

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's a sign of danger, I mean

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In the Purnama dormitory

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on, let's go there now

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Look at your left

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Professor Andepanat

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I thought the scariest thing was the family

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's him

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where is he?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think we can't get out anymore

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If so, we have to attack more

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's go

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What's going on, Professor?

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why is it not open yet?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's going on?

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They are smiling

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Kids, calm down

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The teachers are here

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The teachers will definitely save you, kids

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Professor, let's open it with magic

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Open it

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Weird, it's still not open yet

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's too late, Professor

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Kids

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Who attacked you?

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Karang?

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm not Karang

Calm down, kids

We will definitely save you

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Calm down

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Once the sword is sharpened

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The goat's body will fly

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Dear Queen Venus

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My students

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Prepare for the match tomorrow morning

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, sir

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
See you tomorrow

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's all, sir?

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The goat is not dead, sir

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes, sir

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's too ordinary

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The goat's body is not good, sir

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not sharp, sir

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is there anything else you want to say?

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's no queen

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's all, sir

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go

[Phone ringing]

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If I lose

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have to give this box to them

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But am I willing to?

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000

I am Batu Jiwa

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I remind you

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This box is very precious

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can't give it to them

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are...

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Batu Jiwa's spirit?

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I am

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Batu Jiwa's spirit

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Who broke this box?

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Today

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I will be the judge

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm so lucky

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Whose footprints are these?

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
These footprints lead me to the lost body

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
[Lightning]

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh my God

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The horse's footprints are gone

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Banana!

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We are wrong, sir

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We are not the one who broke the box

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We are the one who broke the box

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We are not the one who broke the box

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't be afraid

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We will save him

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Get up!

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
One, two, three

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We are not afraid

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:55,000
[Lightning]

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let me try the meteorphone's spell, sir

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Meteorphone!

130
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll take it

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You better take it, sir

132
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let me go first

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
[Evil Laugh]

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is still a success, sir

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We are not the one who broke the box

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How is it, sir?

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's going on?

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The door can't be opened

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It seems like there's a power inside

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's go, guys!

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We are broken!

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
[Screaming]

145
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What?

146
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Our friends are fainted!

147
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's blow their noses

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So they can breathe

149
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Rika!

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Get her!

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Lita, get her!

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hurry!

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Rika!

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000

[Lightning]

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What should we do?

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What if the monster is not in there?

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
[Lightning]

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No!

160
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
[Lightning]

161
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's that?

162
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
[Screaming]

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's go!

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
[Screaming]

165
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's a black ghost!

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why is it so powerful?

167
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh, no!

168
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why is it so powerful to attack the monster?

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
[Groaning]

170
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What's wrong?

171
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The monster is gone

172
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It seems like they are attacked

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let's attack the monster together

174
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't let it get away

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes, sir

176
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Power of the Five!

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
[Lightning]

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What's that?

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Rio!

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Professor, why is there a monster here?

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, professor

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
She's poisoned

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Poisoned?

184
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Alfa, what happened?

185
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We are attacked by monsters

186
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We are all attacked by the monster

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
By the monster

188
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Alfa!

189
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm going!

190
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank God, it's okay

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But...

192
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Whose footprints are these?

193
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Who's in here?

194
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's okay, what matters is you and me

195
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Me?

196
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What's happening?

197
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm going to be chased!

198
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Whoever it is, it managed to beat my horse

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And that means...

200
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It has a very high HP

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Even the prey managed to beat it

202
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Who is it?

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I have to be careful

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
[Lightning]

205
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Dr. Pertiwi must be shocked to see so many patients

206
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Ah, hi! You're smiling

207
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's right, Professor Agni

208
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I think we should immediately tighten security

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So that this disaster doesn't happen again

210
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay, then we'll bring the kids to the clinic

211
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes, professor

212
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Pertiwi!

213
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh my God!

214
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
OMG!

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh no, no, no, no

216
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What, what, what the...

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
These are all tests, victims!

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Pertiwi, quickly treat them!

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes, professor!

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Come on

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Teacher, you know that...

222
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is a serum for recovery

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Please, help me!

224
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Help me, pour it into their mouths

225
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go

226
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Pertiwi!

227
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Help Rio first, she's the most seriously injured

228
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh no, oh my God!

229
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, professor

230
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh my goodness!

231
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh professor, why is our school always attacked?

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why, professor?

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Pertiwi is sad

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
As you said, it's a disaster

235
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But just now, I realized

236
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And told me

237
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That Rio is the cause of this disaster

238
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sir

239
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How's the mission, sir?

240
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
All good?

241
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Mission accomplished, sir

242
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Aldebaran finally believes in Leon

243
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I mean, your prionel, sir

244
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Very good, Aldebaran

245
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Good

246
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Now, your job is to fight the protection prism

247
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But, how, sir?

248
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Every time I change to find myself

249
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I always get stuck, sir

250
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't be stupid, Aldebaran

251
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Every mantra, there must be a weak point

252
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You look for a place that is not protected by the dust

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But, where, sir?

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Where?

255
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You look for it, I have to look for it too

256
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay, sir

257
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I want a banana

258
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You're a coward

259
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Who did this?

260
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I want a banana

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Banana, banana

262
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I want a banana

263
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Find it yourself

264
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Banana

265
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Painting of a tiger

266
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Good

267
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is better

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Painting of a tiger

269
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Keep this powder well

270
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't let it get in there again

271
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Good

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Painting of a tiger

273
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Last, Aldebaran

274
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Before we fly

275
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We should do what is called warming up

276
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What is it?

277
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Warming up

278
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay, ready

279
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Follow my movement

280
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
One

281
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Two

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Three

283
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Four

284
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Five

285
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Six

286
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Seven

287
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Eight

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Viru Batu Venus

289
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Eat the strawberry, buy it with the jackfruit

290
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Delicious

291
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They are so confident

292
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They don't know who we are

293
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's right

294
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The match will start soon

295
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Nick from School of Magic versus Viru Batu Venus

296
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Viru Batu Venus

297
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Come on, cheer up for Nick

298
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Long live Nick

299
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Taf, bring out all the bling bling magic

300
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So we can look cool

301
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay

302
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Patan, come here

303
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What is this?

304
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
A stick

305
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You too?

306
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh my

307
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What should we do?

308
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We asked for a stick, but we got a stick

309
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Look, we are being betrayed

310
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Do I have one?

311
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You have one too

312
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You guys

313
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You are so weird sometimes

314
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You are so shy

315
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You are using wrong magic

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
No formal

317
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Come on

318
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Get ready, Nick

319
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Come on, Nick

320
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Nick

321
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Long live Nick

322
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You are just a kid, what can you do?

323
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Nick and Viru Batu Venus will go around this island three times

324
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The one who reaches the finish line first is the winner

325
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Come on, Nick

326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Cheer up

327
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You can do it

328
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
One

329
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Two

330
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Three

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Come on, Nick

332
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Venus

333
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Keep chasing

334
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hurry up

335
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Come on, Viru Batu

336
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Come on, Nick

337
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Concentrate, Nick

338
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You can do it faster than Viru Batu

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That kid is not as strong as he looks

340
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hurry up

341
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Fly higher

342
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Keep chasing, Nick

343
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Come on, Nick

344
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Keep chasing

345
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You can do it

346
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm sure you can win

347
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That's why Viru Batu

348
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Don't underestimate the kids of the magic school

349
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I have to find a way to win

350
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Turns out my kid can't be considered as a queen

351
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Nick

352
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Be careful, Nick

353
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Watch out, Nick

354
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
She's so brave

355
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Turns out

356
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Even though the queen has a beautiful face

357
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
She's a coward

358
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Venus, back off

359
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm sorry

360
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But you can't beat my kid

361
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I have to find a way to win

362
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm sorry

363
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But you can't beat my kid

364
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm sorry

365
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I have to find a way to win

366
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Kids

367
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
In an emergency

368
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Actually, lollipop can be made to fly

369
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But

370
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The result can be fatal

371
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Because it can damage your lollipop

372
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That's bad

373
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's a shame if it's damaged

374
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's very dangerous

375
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The mantra is

376
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Turbofan

377
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Daft Punk

378
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Turbofan

379
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So fast, Nick

380
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Faster than a rocket

381
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You have to win, Nick

382
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Come on, Nick

383
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You have to win, Nick

384
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Faster than a rocket

385
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Faster

386
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Come on, Nick

387
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You have to win, Nick

388
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Come on, Nick

389
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Faster

390
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah!

391
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We won!

392
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Great, Nick

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Last cut

394
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Adi Arati!

395
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh, my

396
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The beautiful Venus Queen

397
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We beg you

398
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Give me that soul

399
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The most beautiful woman in the world

400
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's okay

401
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I won't give you this

402
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You're so cruel

403
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Please be fair

404
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The boy is in the top

405
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The beautiful queen

406
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Turns out she likes to lie

407
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
She's lying

408
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Please be fair

409
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Listen

410
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If you want this necklace

411
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You have to fulfill one more requirement

412
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What is the last requirement that the Venus Queen wants?

413
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Pertiwi

414
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes, Prof

415
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
How is Rio?

416
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Rio is still out of consciousness

417
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But the others are all awake

418
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Amazing, right, Prof?

419
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Why is Rio the only one who's still unconscious?

420
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Vega

421
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Rio is already poisoned by the laba-laba

422
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
When we came in earlier

423
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You were all unconscious

424
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Only Rio can survive

425
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And she defeated the laba-laba

426
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's great

427
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
If you write a new one

428
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Rio will be so great

429
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Looks like the boy has become a hero

430
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh my God

431
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So sad

432
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
How can I repay you?

433
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm happy

434
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm tired, I'm dizzy

435
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Good night, Birbi

436
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Agni

437
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Tonight

438
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We'll have a party

439
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
For Rio

440
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yes, Prof

441
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry, dear

442
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Just leave us alone

443
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We can do it

444
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This place is so quiet

445
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
No one comes here

446
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Maybe the Venus Queen isn't here

447
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
No sign of the Venus Queen

448
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Maybe she's in the dark

449
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I did it

450
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The Valdebaran

451
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Is nothing to me

452
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm waiting for you

453
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Rio is fighting the laba-laba

454
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
With the matrix

455
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Who is she?

456
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Pegasus

457
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Vixor

458
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Where are you, Rio?

459
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm so scared

460
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:40,000
We did it

461
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Thank you, Rio

462
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Thank you for saving us

463
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thank you

464
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Rio

465
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You did a great job

466
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And you

467
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Will hold an event

468
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
To give away medals to you

469
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's too much

470
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What I did

471
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Was nothing special

472
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Thank you, Rio

473
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Thank you

474
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Say thank you to Rio

475
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Thank you, Rio

476
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Alfa

477
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Please take the drinks from that table

478
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Why do I hear a voice?

479
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Alfa

480
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Don't

481
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If you look at me again

482
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'll be

483
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What?

484
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Alfa

485
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Why did Alfa leave?

486
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Of course

487
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Alfa is jealous

488
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Of Rio

489
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Who is now

490
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
A total loser

491
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Right?

492
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Of course

493
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Alfa

494
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You lost to Rio

495
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Right?

496
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Alfa is not that kind of person

497
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
She's a good girl

498
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I know

499
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You're so mean, Miri

500
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I know

501
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Enough

502
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's go

503
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Let's go to Alfa

504
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's go

505
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
(Alfa is not that kind of person)

506
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Alfa

507
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What is she doing?

508
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Alfa

509
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What are you doing?

510
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Running around the clinic

511
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Don't you know?

512
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Alfa looks confused

513
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I know

514
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Did you hear that?

515
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The professor is coming

516
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
No

517
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What?

518
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I heard it

519
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You're kidding

520
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes

521
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The professor can't come to school

522
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's why I want to check

523
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
If it's true or not

524
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But it's not possible

525
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's not possible

526
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Alfa

527
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Ray

528
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm not lying

529
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What are you doing?

530
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I want to find her and meet her

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Do you want to come?

532
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
If you don't want to come

533
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Go to the clinic

534
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Take care of Rio

535
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Alfa

536
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
She's so annoying

537
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
She's so annoying to Rio

538
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Because she wants to be a hero

539
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I know

540
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Don't you know Alfa?

541
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
She's your friend

542
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I know

543
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't like her

544
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Just kidding

545
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Alfa's friend

546
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I heard a voice from here

547
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Where is it?

548
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Maybe it's inside

549
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What's wrong with you?

550
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's just my feeling

551
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think it's a cockroach

552
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I have to find it

553
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Just leave us alone

554
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What's wrong with you?

555
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Thank God, there's nothing

556
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm going to be late again

557
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I failed again

558
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I give up

559
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Get out

560
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm confused

561
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I heard a voice

562
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I thought it was a cockroach

563
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But there's no one

564
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't feel good

565
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I feel like I'm missing something

566
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But there's no one

567
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Okay

568
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'll tell you the last condition

569
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I want you to make this white cloth

570
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Turn red

571
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
If you can

572
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'll give you

573
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The queen's request

574
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Just change this fabric color

575
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
To red

576
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay

577
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The noble queen Venus

578
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We will do

579
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
What is the requirement of the queen Venus

580
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If so, do it right away

581
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Hurry

582
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Give it to me when you're done

583
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Hey

584
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Is there anyone?

585
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Hey

586
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Lay the fabric

587
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Prepare the drawing equipment

588
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Okay

589
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Now we will start

590
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Nick

591
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You draw first

592
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Okay, sir

593
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Eh

594
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Why is it suddenly gone?

595
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's gone

596
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
How could it be?

597
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Maybe this fabric doesn't suit you

598
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'll try to draw my face

599
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Which is similar to that fabric

600
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Surely this will not refuse

601
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Immediately gone

602
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's gone

603
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Why isn't there?

604
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh my God

605
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's it

606
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Because your face is ugly

607
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Here I try

608
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Try there

609
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Oh my God

610
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
See

611
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Gone

612
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
[Laughter]

613
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Too medical

614
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Wait

615
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Clear

616
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That the fabric given by the queen Venus

617
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
This is not a fabric

618
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
This fabric has been unused for a long time

619
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
No one comes

620
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Surely I can make myself a human being here

621
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Ah

622
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Just there

623
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
If I'm here

624
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I will be a loser again

625
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Just like me in the history of the Alba

626
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
[Laughter]

627
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Finally found a big place

628
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Bigger than my Alba

629
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Now let me know the situation

630
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Sir

631
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You guys are rude

632
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What else?

633
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Sorry sir

634
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I didn't mean to make you fall sir

635
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But

636
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I have good news sir

637
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Good news?

638
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I

639
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Can be a human being again in the desert sir

640
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Without being driven away

641
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Just make a festival sir

642
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And do you know sir

643
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I can do this

644
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Because I'm hiding

645
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The ruins are still broken sir

646
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And

647
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Not because of the flood sir

648
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
How sir?

649
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm smart right?

650
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You're really stupid Angkar

651
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I told you

652
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If that can be done

653
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Enough Angkar

654
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You don't bother me anymore

655
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'll scream

656
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
If Aldebaran hears your voice

657
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'll be angry

658
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Hey

659
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I want to be

660
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
A hero

661
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I've been using something

662
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
From the toilet

663
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The toilet is broken

664
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Not used anymore

665
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Or maybe

666
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Hey

667
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Is there anyone?

668
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Hey

669
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Is there anyone?

670
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Hey

671
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This cloth is so weird

672
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This cloth is from Queen Venus

673
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Really weird

674
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
With all the way

675
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
One line

676
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
No one sticks to this cloth

677
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Hey

678
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I've brought it

679
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Bad with my father

680
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
He's the one I need!

681
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Watch out!

682
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'll do it!

683
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:12,000
[chanting]

684
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Finally!

685
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
This is so funny!

686
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Who is it?

687
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's Vega.

688
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'll go back to the dorm.

689
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's sick!

690
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
He doesn't know what's inside the sim.

691
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I have to go to the toilet.

692
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What should we do?

693
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
We've tried everything.

694
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But this cloth doesn't change into red.

695
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's a waste.

696
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Should we just give up?

697
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
No.

698
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
If we give up, how are we going to get the box?

699
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Oh, no.

700
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's so easy.

701
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The queen is so cunning.

702
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Wait.

703
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Where are you going?

704
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm going to make a salad.

705
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm going to get some inspiration.

706
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Rio! Rio!

707
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Rio, you're done.

708
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm proud of you.

709
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
He's our leader.

710
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yes.

711
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Yes, Din.

712
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Get ready for the next lesson.

713
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Rio! Rio!

714
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Wow, it's so beautiful.

715
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Do you like it?

716
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
If you like it, you can have it.

717
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm fighting against the bad guys.

718
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm fighting for our safety.

719
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Not for the medal.

720
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Wow, that's so cute.

721
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
We're so proud of you.

722
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's so hard to make you happy.

723
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Rio, congratulations.

724
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Where did you learn to be a medalist?

725
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
This is the medal.

726
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yes, I saw it.

727
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So, I want to say congratulations.

728
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You're welcome.

729
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Can I say something?

730
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Sure.

731
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Where did you learn to do a magic trick?

732
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Magic trick?

733
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes, magic trick.

734
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
You beat the bad guys with magic trick, right?

735
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's black magic.

736
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
[The next episode]

737
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Are you sure Rio said the magic trick?

738
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
If not, you're dead.

739
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:53,000
[The next episode]

740
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Inspiration.

741
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Come on, I'm confused.

742
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
If there's a magic that can inspire me,

743
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
there must be a way out.

744
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
To turn the fabric into red, like Queen Venus' wish.

745
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Hi.

746
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Hi, sir.

747
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Why are you calling me sir?

748
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Did you forget who I am?

749
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yes, I'm Megantara.

750
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Megantara.

751
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Can I give you a hand?

752
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Sure.

753
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
There's a beautiful girl,

754
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
but she's in a bad mood.

755
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Hi, beautiful girl.

756
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Can you help me?

757
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
What do you want me to do?

758
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Let me be clear.

759
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I'm confused.

760
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm so confused.

761
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
With your queen's challenge,

762
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
which is to turn the fabric into red.

763
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Please, help me.

764
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Give me a clue.

765
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
How can the fabric turn into red?

766
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Fabric is the queen's wish.

767
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
No one has ever turned the fabric into red.

768
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It's our fault.

769
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Just give up.

770
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Because any effort is useless.

771
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Give up?

772
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Useless?

773
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Traveling to the north,

774
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
wearing a red hat,

775
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
called Megantara.

776
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I don't know what giving up means.

777
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I will keep fighting,

778
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
finding a way to turn the fabric into red,

779
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
like Queen Venus' wish.

780
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And I will succeed.

781
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I will not give up.

782
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Okay, just try.

783
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Do you want me to try?

784
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I will not give up.

785
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But how?

786
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
How?

787
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I thought about it,

788
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
now I'm hungry.

789
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But if I'm hungry, there's no food here.

790
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'm eating while watching the dance.

791
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
When I'm hungry, there's durian.

792
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm hungry.

793
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Durian!

794
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Eat durian!

795
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
There's a goat.

796
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Who is that goat?

797
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Is the goat asking for durian?

798
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Since when does a goat eat durian?

799
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's really angry.

800
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Be patient.

801
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I want durian. Just eat it.

802
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Eat it.

803
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I want durian.

804
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Eat it.

805
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I want durian.

806
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Eat it.

807
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I want durian.

808
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Eat it.

809
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
That goat is really angry.

810
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
What are you doing?

811
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I don't understand.

812
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What do you mean?

813
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You're the one who attacked the goat using the mantra.

814
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I heard it.

815
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I didn't say that mantra.

816
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I just learned the mantra from the mantra teacher.

817
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That's all.

818
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Are you sure that he said that mantra?

819
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
If not, you're lying.

820
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm not lying.

821
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I heard it.

822
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But you were still unconscious.

823
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
How could you see it?

824
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I wasn't unconscious.

825
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I heard it.

826
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Alfa.

827
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You don't have to be jealous.

828
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You have a lot of power.

829
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Don't be jealous.

830
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I'm jealous.

831
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You're not jealous.

832
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Alfa, calm down.

833
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Even though he's great, we're still your friends.

834
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Right?

835
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I'm not jealous.

836
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You don't trust me, right?

837
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Stop fighting.

838
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Alfa, don't be jealous.

839
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I didn't mean it.

840
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't want to be a hero.

841
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Or anything.

842
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I just want to fight the goats.

843
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So, we can be safe.

844
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
If not, we'll die.

845
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm so proud of you.

846
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
How about we switch partners?

847
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Me and Rio.

848
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You and Alfa.

849
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't want to.

850
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
My sister chose Alfa.

851
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I want to be with Rio.

852
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
We're twins.

853
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We should share everything.

854
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I agree.

855
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
But, I don't think you're that great.

856
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I'm so jealous of you.

857
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Let's find someone else.

858
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Let's go.

859
00:57:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
"Alfa and Rio"

860
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:56,000
That person again.

861
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
"Alfa and Rio"

862
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Harimau, what happened to you?

863
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I told you to take care of this pig.

864
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Not a date.

865
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
He's even more fierce.

866
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You're so mean.

867
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
"Alfa and Rio"

868
00:59:43,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Alfa.

869
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Rio.

870
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
"Alfa and Rio"

871
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:24,000
A mask to protect your skin.

872
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Who dares to do this?

873
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Making a mask out of peanuts.

874
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I have an idea.

875
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:03,000
"Alfa and Rio"

876
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Nik, Riceh, Ari, Oktav.

877
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Help me.

878
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
What's wrong?

879
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Look for a cloth or a bandage.

880
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
He's in so much pain. What's wrong?

881
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I met a goat.

882
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
A wild goat that doesn't know how to speak.

883
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's a basic. It must be at school.

884
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But the goat is okay, right?

885
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Goat?

886
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Hurry up and find a cloth or a bandage.

887
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I almost broke my kid.

888
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Okay, wait.

889
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I'm out of cloth.

890
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Slowly.

891
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Okay.

892
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Thank you, Nik.

893
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You're welcome.

894
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm going to rest.

895
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
He's out of the house.

896
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
He's looking for inspiration.

897
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
He met a goat.

898
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's so good.

899
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It doesn't know how to speak.

900
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's a bad luck.

901
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
What?

902
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
What's wrong, soldier?

903
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Where's the cloth?

904
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
It's gone.

905
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Where is it?

906
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I don't know.

907
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Why is it gone?

908
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Don't.

909
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Don't say that, soldier.

910
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
The cloth is in his hand.

911
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It's true, soldier.

912
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Because he's bleeding, he's changing his color.

913
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It's turning red.

914
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Red?

915
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yes, red.

916
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It means...

917
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This white cloth...

918
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Can turn red...

919
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
If...

920
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's touched by...

921
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The goat.

922
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
We've solved the problem.

923
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
We need blood.

924
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
If so, just hurt the soldier's hand.

925
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's true.

926
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It'll turn red.

927
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The soldier is bleeding.

928
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I'm going to die.

929
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Kids.

930
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Today, I'm going to teach you...

931
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
How to make a love potion.

932
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But before that, I want to ask you.

933
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Does anyone know what love potion is?

934
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Rio, you answer.

935
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Love potion is...

936
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
A magic potion.

937
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
So, the person who drinks it...

938
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Will fall in love with the person who gives it to them.

939
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
You're so smart, Rio.

940
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Since it's Valentine's Day...

941
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm sure there are many kids...

942
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Who want to make a love potion.

943
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm here...

944
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
To teach you how to make a love potion.

945
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
How to make a love potion?

946
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
How?

947
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
How to turn the white cloth into red using blood?

948
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We've used a lot of soldiers, but it's still not enough.

949
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Even the anime...

950
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
We can't make it.

951
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Really?

952
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Made from brown beans.

953
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I have an idea.

954
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Buy cheap clothes in Jeparang.

955
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
What's your idea, soldier?

956
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You can help us.

957
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Are you ready?

958
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Come.

959
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Get ready.

960
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,000
The Phantom Camera.

961
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
What is that camera for?

962
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
For selfie?

963
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's not the time yet.

964
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
You're so slow.

965
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
This is not a regular camera.

966
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
This is a double camera.

967
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It can double the object in the photo.

01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Oh, my.

969
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
What's the connection with this cloth, soldier?

970
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Do you know what it's called?

971
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You're so slow.

972
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It takes a long time to load.

973
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Look.

974
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It's double.

975
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Wait a minute.

976
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's triple.

Look.

01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's red.

981
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
The cloth is red.

982
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It's amazing.

01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Now, the ingredients are in front of you.

And a bit of turmeric.

995
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Now, if you stir the ingredients three times clockwise.

996
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You will get a pink liquid.

997
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000

You failed. Try again.

Okay.

1003
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:13,000

Usually, you can make a mess.

1017
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Why did you fail this time?

1018
01:10:29,000 --> 01:11:14,000

1019
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000

What are you doing?

1021
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
There's no poison.

1022
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I'm not doing anything.

1023
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
