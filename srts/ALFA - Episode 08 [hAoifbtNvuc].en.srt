00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To be continued...

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Calm down, kids

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We will find out what happened

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Megantara, it's better if you take the kids out of here

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And don't let a single kid fly

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Professor, who installed the horrible magic in this gate?

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know either, Megantara

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's clear is that you can't leave this village

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And we can't enter the village

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You saved my grandpa

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because you saved my grandpa

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now you're going to be my grandpa

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The magical beam managed to defeat the monster

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And locked it in the cave

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No one knows where the cave is

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But this magic is not permanent

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the monster can be released

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we have to find out who the descendant of the magical beam is

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who can lock the monster in it

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm surprised, Dek

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How can a snake talk to you?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm surprised too

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I used to talk to a snake

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe it's the descendant of the magical beam

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nonsense, Dek

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't be the descendant of the magical beam

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm new here

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nonsense, Dek

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's possible, if you're the one who did it

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How can you lock the monster in the cave?

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did your parents ever tell you about Uncle Wisdom?

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know them

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't even know who they are

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My parents said they died a good man

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're so naive

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll listen to you

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We have to break the stone

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Or we'll be locked in the cave

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want to learn too

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's learn together

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That monster is too small for me

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But it can be released by our teacher

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why is it a snake?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You pretended to be retired

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're exaggerating

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not pretending to be retired

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It seems like they're more confident now

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because they've got a new mantra

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's good

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But we can't give up

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We have to keep an eye on these monsters

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What about Professor Purwa?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you have any clue?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The book doesn't mention the type of monster

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The shape

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And the weakness

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How can we defeat it?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And we can't go home

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because the village gate is cursed by a very powerful magic

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're all trapped here

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We have to find a way to escape

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alva

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's so scary

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The teacher knows about the monster

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But he covered us so we won't be scared

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And the door is cursed by a very powerful magic

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So the students can't get out

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why Professor Albaran can't get in

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think someone's watching us

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do we do?

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The monster has attacked two students

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How long do we have to wait?

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Soon, sir

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They're trapped in the village

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All the students will turn into stone

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Including the special students

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you just have to wait

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm bored here

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to go back to school

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, we can't eat at school

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
[The teacher is angry]

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Prita, you can eat the chocolate by yourself

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, share it with me

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you want

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My chocolate! Give it back!

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Prita, what's wrong?

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My chocolate was taken by Jack and Mike

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They ran away

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a problem

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I know, but in this situation, it's still a problem

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Prita, don't be sad

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll go after them

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't worry, I'll go with you

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ray, don't be late

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Smells good

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's wrong?

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why did you stop?

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go after Jack and Mike

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, let's go

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
My stomach hurts

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mike, wait for me!

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
[The teacher is angry]

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mike?

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mike!

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's Jack's voice

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe it's another monster

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mike!

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Help!

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm scared

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Jack saw Mike being attacked

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's why he's still shocked

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, let's take them inside

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sorry, Professor Purwa

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let Mike handle it

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alva, let's listen to this

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How?

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go inside

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Kids

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't go anywhere

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Stay here

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And always be careful

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
[The teacher is angry]

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Alva?

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:32,000
[The teacher is angry]

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you okay?

142
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm okay

143
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
[The teacher is angry]

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is the maximum amount of alcohol

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you drink that, you'll be calm

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now tell me what happened

147
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just now

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was putting on my shoes

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And Mike ran away

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And then the monster came

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was so scared

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And then he turned into a rock

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is the first time this has happened

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Usually, students are attacked when they are happy

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Professor Agni

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's read his mind

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, Professor

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
[The teacher is angry]

159
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My shoes hurt

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Mike, wait for me!

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hurry!

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:41,000
[The teacher is angry]

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Mike!

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I like that monster

165
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It looks like the monster likes chocolate

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's weird

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How can a monster as cruel as that like chocolate?

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Wait, Professor Purwa

169
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have to make sure of something

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:55,000
[The teacher is angry]

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How is it, Professor Agni?

172
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It seems like it's true

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
When Tol is attacked

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There's chocolate

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes, sir

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And when Nick was attacked

177
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Nick was being tested

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He was carrying chocolate

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Megantara

180
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Go back to your students

181
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Watch them

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't let anyone panic

183
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And watch them

184
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't let anyone pass through the village

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It can be very dangerous for them

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Professor

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
[The teacher is angry]

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How is it, Mr. Agni?

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't worry

190
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Mr. Agni is resting

191
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's sleeping

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What about Mike?

193
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mike is being treated

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
With a medicine

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Aren't you afraid?

196
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, sir

197
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We're not afraid, right?

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, sir

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Good

200
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Who said we're not afraid?

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This place is getting more dangerous

202
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But it's our turn to be the bad guys

203
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's run away

204
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you agree?

205
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, sir

206
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Now we know the monster likes chocolate

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So we have to protect our friends

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So they won't eat chocolate

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I agree

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So they won't be attacked by the monster

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's go

212
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:38,000
[The teacher is angry]

213
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hurry up, Don!

214
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm late

215
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
[The teacher is angry]

216
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's dangerous, we have to run

217
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll go through the village gate

218
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I have to stop this

219
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The army!

220
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The army is coming!

221
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The army!

222
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What should we do?

223
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The army!

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Now

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's time for the monster to do its job

226
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:09,000
[We can do it]

227
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Wait!

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're so slow

229
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You said you're not afraid

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But you want to run away?

231
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on

232
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You all go back to your house

233
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We want to go home

234
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This place is getting more dangerous

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So that's all you have?

236
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Listen

237
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're special kids

238
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Kids who are spoiled by other kids

239
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you're afraid

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't have the courage

241
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What's the difference between you and other kids?

242
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you know why you're still asked to come here?

243
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Do you?

244
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Look at this

245
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
[The Black Magic]

246
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This cave is haunted by the black magic

247
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If we pass it

248
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You'll all be destroyed

249
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What should we do?

250
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We have to fight it

251
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Remember

252
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're special kids

253
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Go back to being farmers

254
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Go back to being brave

255
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Agree?

256
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Agree!

That's it

[The Black Magic]

263
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now you know the situation

264
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But

265
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't be shocked by the situation

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You have to be calmer

267
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And be ready to face it

268
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000

Yes, we're scared

This fear is our enemy's target

272
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If we're scared, the enemy will be happy

273
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But if we're happy

274
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The enemy will feel lonely

275
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do you understand?

276
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes, sir

I'm so happy

Because we're your friends

What's this?

This is a communication mirror

If necessary, destroy all the chocolate trees there

336
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So the villagers can't make chocolates anymore

What? Chocolates?

361
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That means...

362
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That means the monster is coming

Yes, we're in danger

Then, why did you tell us to throw it away?

We don't know!

Tommy, Jack, this chocolate is dangerous

Don't lie!

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There's no monster that likes chocolate

Why? You don't want to tell us?

383
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Go away!

00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Why is there a smell of chocolate here?

386
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes, Tendra, they're making chocolates

387
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
What? / Yes

388
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't understand

389
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Why is there so much chocolate here?

390
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Tendra told us to have fun

391
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But we're making chocolates

392
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's delicious

393
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Now, throw all of these chocolates away!

394
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Why are we throwing them away?

395
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The chocolate is delicious!

396
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This chocolate

397
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
will make you feel guilty

398
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you know, guys?

399
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Mike, Jack, and Tole

400
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Why did they become a band?

401
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because they ate the chocolate!

402
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you're still making chocolates,

403
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it means you're ready to be eaten by the monster!

You're in my way!

[Previously]

408
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Go away!

409
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And bring the food

410
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The chocolate smell is so strong

411
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Do your job

412
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and destroy them!

414
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is the only way

415
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
for me to enter the station

416
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000

Gili Ipi!

419
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's another man!

420
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why is that man calling us?

421
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He must be working for us

422
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hey, young ladies

423
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm here

424
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
to invite you to a dance

425
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
A dance?

426
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yes

427
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The loser has to follow the winner's will

428
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
How?

429
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Why?

430
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you scared?

431
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Just dance!

432
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We're never scared

433
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
especially with men

434
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on, Gili Ipi!

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000

Enough!

438
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I admit defeat

439
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You're really great, Putri Angsa

440
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We don't believe in men

441
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Where's the man?

442
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Now, you can punish me

443
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
with anything

444
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But please, don't put me in jail

445
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because I'm most afraid of water

446
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Especially in this lake

447
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
There's a hole that can lead to the magic village

448
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't take me there

449
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm afraid of that place

450
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm afraid of that hole

451
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He's afraid of the hole

452
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Let's just take him there

453
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So he won't be afraid

454
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because you're afraid of water

455
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and the lake

456
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We'll take you to the most secluded place

I'm scared, dad

Zhen, you're a galaxy

466
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You should be quick

Now you have to remember, Alva

475
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Don't you ever look at the sparkling eyes

476
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Remember, don't you ever look at the sparkling eyes

477
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Maybe the sparkling eyes are the snake eyes

478
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Guys, don't look at the snake eyes!

Yes!

He's already in the cave

Now we attack him

What happened to me?

526
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You were a stone!

527
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Enough!

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We don't want to make a scene

529

Let's get out of here

530

Don't be happy yet, Ava

534
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The snake doesn't die

535
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It just escapes

536
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So the snake can come back?

537
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It can come back if it smells like chocolate

538
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We should leave this place

539
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Bring the children out of the village

540
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I've found a way to get out of the village

541
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But professor

542
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What about the mantra that's blocking the village?

543
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The mantra is a sign for us

544
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Once we get out

545
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The mantra will disappear

546
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Rey!

547
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Wake up!

548
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Ava

549
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You didn't eat the monster, did you?

550
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
No

551
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Let's go

552
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Is everything messed up?

553
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What's going on?

554
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Maybe they're playing war

555
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Hurry!

556
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look!

557
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Who's playing?

558
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Three!

559
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Rey!

560
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Ava!

561
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Children

562
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Let's go back to school

563

Professor

564
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
How's the monster?

565
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
We managed to get rid of the monster

566
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But it's not dead yet

567
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Only escaped

568
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You have to be alert

569
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And now

570
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We have to go back to school

571
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Bring the children to a safer place

572
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But I and the teachers will come back here

573
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
To kill the monster

574
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Thank you, professor Ladebaran

575
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Rita

576
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I have to go

577
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You'll come back here, won't you?

578
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Of course

579
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But don't forget

580
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
We'll contact you through this channel

581
00:47:27,000 --> 00:48:10,000
To be continued...

582
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This well

583
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Connects to the lake around our school

584
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And we'll go in there one by one

585
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
As soon as you get in

586
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You have to swim as fast as you can

587
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
To the lake

588
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You'll pair up

589
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And the teachers will help you

590
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
To be continued...

591
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Wait!

592
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Don't think you can leave this village so easily

593
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Nice to meet you, Ankara

594
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But unfortunately

595
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
We have to say goodbye

596
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Don't be arrogant, Ladebaran

597
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The science I'm in charge of

598
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Is far better than the last time we met

599
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Ankara

600
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Don't talk too much

601
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You're not even willing to defeat me

602
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
How can you defeat professor Ladebaran?

603
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Professor

604
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's better

605
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
To bring your children

606
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So that I can face this challenge

607
00:49:35,000 --> 00:50:46,000
To be continued...

608
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That's it, let's go

609
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So that I can face this challenge

610
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Hurry up, give me the children

611
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Hurry up, let's go

612
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
To be continued...

613
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I haven't lost yet

614
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And I will never lose

615
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Everything is in vain

616
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm not going to lose

617
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Everyone is home

618
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm the only one left

619
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Hi, Mahfiz

620
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't want people to be in trouble because of me

621
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I have to face this

622
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You guys, don't tell anyone

623
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:04,000
We can do it

624
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Thank God, there's a crazy person in here

625
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Thank God

626
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Hurry up, there's a crazy person

627
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Hurry up, there's a crazy person in here

628
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Help

629
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Felita, what's wrong?

630
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Help, I'm scared

631
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Hello everyone

632
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Felita is in my hands

633
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And you tell Alva

634
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
If Alva still wants this child to live

635
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Then she has to surrender herself

636
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I don't understand

637
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's up to you to tell Alva

638
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
The important thing is you have to find me to Ramadhan

639
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Felita and Antaboga will be waiting for you

640
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Huh? Antaboga?

641
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Your time is only 1x24 hours

642
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
If you're late

643
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Then this child will be gone forever

644
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I will return to the magic village

645
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
To lock the monster in the cave of Krama

646
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You guys take care of the children

647
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And stay alert

648
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Because Ankara won't give up so easily

649
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
He will definitely do everything

650
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm sorry, Prof

651
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But the professor can

652
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Because as far as I know

653
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
According to the legend

654
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There's a monster in the cave of Krama

655
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because as far as I know

656
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
According to the legend

657
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Only people of the five sacred tribes

658
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Can open and close the cave

659
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I will still try

660
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So that the villagers of the magic village can live in peace

661
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Alva

662
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Don't be stubborn

663
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
If you go there alone

664
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You will be attacked by the monsters

665
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yes, sir

666
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's report it to the soldiers and the professor

667
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes

668
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They will definitely accompany you

669
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Besides

670
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
If you go with the professor

671
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You will be protected

672
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yes, sir

673
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
The professor can turn into a bird

674
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yes, sir

675
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Professor Agni can also turn into a cat

676
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The soldiers can also change

677
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
No

678
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I have to help him

679
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Alva

680
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Don't be stubborn

681
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No

682
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I will go back alone

683
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't want people to be in danger because of me

684
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I have to be patient

685
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You guys

686
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Don't tell anyone

687
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Alva

688
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm so scared

689
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's report it to the professor

690
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Let's go

691
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Evil

692
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You left me

693
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I can be miserable

694
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I can be in pain

695
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I can die

696
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Evil

697
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Po

698
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Evil

699
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's not working

700
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Po

701
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
What are you doing here?

702
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Po

703
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm just sitting here

704
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Why?

705
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Why is Alva back?

706
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm looking for the treasure

707
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Do you know where it is?

708
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
What?

709
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What are you doing there?

710
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Plit is kidnapped

711
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Plit is captured

712
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I have to help her

713
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Do you know?

714
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I don't know

715
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Good

716
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Walk me there

717
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh no

718
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Alva

719
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's so scary there

720
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
There's a ghost

721
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I have a bad experience with a ghost

722
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
What kind of experience?

723
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So

724
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That time

725
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I didn't mean to

726
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I fell into the cave

727
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I met a ghost

728
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
What?

729
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm sorry

730
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm so scared

731
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Don't be scared

732
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm here

733
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I'm sorry

734
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I didn't mean to

735
00:58:34,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm so scared

736
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The spell that was played by the dark lord

737
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Turned Antaboga into a mole

738
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
A ghost

739
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And since then

740
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I became a follower of the dark lord

741
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So, Antaboga can be a ghost

742
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
If we play the spell

743
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I can play the spell

744
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So, Antaboga likes a special music

745
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If I make a mistake, I can be cursed

746
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I can be cursed by Antaboga

747
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Teach me the spell

748
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
How?

749
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'll think about it

750
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Come on, Popo

751
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Teach me

752
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Please

753
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay, I'll teach you

754
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Seriously?

755
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Even though I don't like it

756
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Even though I'm forced to

757
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Thank you, Popo

758
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Please, God

759
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I went back to the village

760
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I was about to be kidnapped by Professor Angkara

761
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And Professor Angkara said

762
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I have to go there

763
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I can't go with him

764
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
He has to go alone

765
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Or else, he'll be cursed

766
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I can do it

767
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Yeah, I can do it

768
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Thank you for teaching me

769
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Popo was hugged

770
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
