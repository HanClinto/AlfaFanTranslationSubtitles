Calm down, kids

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We will find out what happened

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Megantara, it's better if you take the kids out of here

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And don't let a single kid fly

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Professor, who installed the horrible magic in this gate?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know either, Megantara

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's clear is that you can't leave this village

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And we can't enter the village

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You saved my grandpa

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because you saved my grandpa

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now you're going to be my grandpa

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The magical beam managed to defeat the monster

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And locked it in the cave

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No one knows where the cave is

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But this magic is not permanent

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the monster can be released

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we have to find out who the descendant of the magical beam is

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who can lock the monster in it

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm surprised, Dek

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How can a snake talk to you?

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm surprised too

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I used to talk to a snake

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe it's the descendant of the magical beam

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nonsense, Dek

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't be the descendant of the magical beam

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm new here

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nonsense, Dek

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's possible, if you're the one who did it

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How can you lock the monster in the cave?

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did your parents ever tell you about Uncle Wisdom?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know them

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't even know who they are

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My parents said they died a good man

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're so naive

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll listen to you

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We have to break the stone

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Or we'll be locked in the cave

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want to learn too

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's learn together

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That monster is too small for me

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But it can be released by our teacher

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why is it a snake?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You pretended to be retired

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're exaggerating

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not pretending to be retired

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It seems like they're more confident now

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because they've got a new mantra

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's good

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But we can't give up

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We have to keep an eye on these monsters

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What about Professor Purwa?

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you have any clue?

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The book doesn't mention the type of monster

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The shape

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And the weakness

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How can we defeat it?

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And we can't go home

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because the village gate is cursed by a very powerful magic

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're all trapped here

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We have to find a way to escape

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alfa

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's so scary

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The teacher knows about the monster

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But he covered us so we won't be scared

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And the door is cursed by a very powerful magic

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So the students can't get out

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why Professor Albaran can't get in

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think someone's watching us

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do we do?

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The monster has attacked two students

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How long do we have to wait?

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Soon, sir

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They're trapped in the village

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All the students will turn into stone

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Including the special students

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you just have to wait

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm bored here

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to go back to school

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, we can't eat at school

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
[The teacher is angry]

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Prita, you can eat the chocolate by yourself

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, share it with me

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you want

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My chocolate! Give it back!

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Prita, what's wrong?

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My chocolate was taken by Jack and Mike

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They ran away

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a problem

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I know, but in this situation, it's still a problem

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Prita, don't be sad

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll go after them

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't worry, I'll go with you

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ray, don't be late

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Smells good

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's wrong?

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why did you stop?

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go after Jack and Mike

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, let's go

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
My stomach hurts

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mike, wait for me!

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
[The teacher is angry]

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mike?

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mike!

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's Jack's voice

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe it's another monster

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mike!

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Help!

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm scared

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Jack saw Mike being attacked

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's why he's still shocked

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, let's take them inside

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sorry, Professor Purwa

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let Mike handle it

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alfa, let's listen to this

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How?

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go inside

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Kids

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't go anywhere

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Stay here

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And always be careful

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
[The teacher is angry]

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Alfa?

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:32,000
[The teacher is angry]

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you okay?

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm okay

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
[The teacher is angry]

145
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is the maximum amount of alcohol

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you drink that, you'll be calm

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now tell me what happened

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just now

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was putting on my shoes

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And Mike ran away

151
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And then the monster came

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was so scared

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And then he turned into a rock

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is the first time this has happened

155
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Usually, students are attacked when they are happy

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Professor Agni

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's read his mind

158
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, Professor

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
[The teacher is angry]

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My shoes hurt

161
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Mike, wait for me!

162
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hurry!

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:41,000
[The teacher is angry]

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Mike!

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I like that monster

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It looks like the monster likes chocolate

167
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's weird

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How can a monster as cruel as that like chocolate?

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Wait, Professor Purwa

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have to make sure of something

171
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:55,000
[The teacher is angry]

172
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How is it, Professor Agni?

173
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It seems like it's true

174
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
When Tol is attacked

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There's chocolate

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes, sir

177
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And when Nick was attacked

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Nick was being tested

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He was carrying chocolate

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Megantara

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Go back to your students

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Watch them

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't let anyone panic

184
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And watch them

185
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't let anyone pass through the village

186
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It can be very dangerous for them

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Professor

How is it, Mr. Agni?

190
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't worry

191
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Mr. Agni is resting

192
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's sleeping

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What about Mike?

194
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mike is being treated

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
With a medicine

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Aren't you afraid?

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, sir

198
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We're not afraid, right?

199
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, sir

200
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Good

201
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Who said we're not afraid?

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This place is getting more dangerous

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But it's our turn to be the bad guys

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's run away

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you agree?

206
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, sir

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Now we know the monster likes chocolate

208
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So we have to protect our friends

209
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So they won't eat chocolate

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I agree

211
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So they won't be attacked by the monster

212
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's go

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:38,000

214
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hurry up, Don!

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm late

216

[The teacher is angry]

217
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's dangerous, we have to run

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll go through the village gate

219
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I have to stop this

220
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The army!

221
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The army is coming!

222
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The army!

223
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What should we do?

224
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The army!

225
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Now

226
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's time for the monster to do its job

227
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:09,000
[We can do it]

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Wait!

229
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're so slow

230
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You said you're not afraid

231
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But you want to run away?

232
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on

233
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You all go back to your house

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We want to go home

235
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This place is getting more dangerous

236
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So that's all you have?

237
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Listen

238
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're special kids

Kids who are spoiled by other kids

240
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you're afraid

241
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't have the courage

242
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What's the difference between you and other kids?

243
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you know why you're still asked to come here?

244
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Do you?

245
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Look at this

[The Black Magic]

247
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This cave is haunted by the black magic

248
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If we pass it

249
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You'll all be destroyed

250
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What should we do?

251
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We have to fight it

252
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Remember

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're special kids

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Go back to being farmers

Go back to being brave

[The Black Magic]

264
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now you know the situation

265
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But

266
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't be shocked by the situation

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You have to be calmer

268
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And be ready to face it

Yes, we're scared

This fear is our enemy's target

If we're scared, the enemy will be happy

274

But if we're happy

275
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The enemy will feel lonely

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That means...

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Don't let Alfa eat it

383
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Why? You don't want to tell us?

384
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Go away!

385
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Tendra!

386
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Why is there a smell of chocolate here?

387
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes, Tendra, they're making chocolates

388
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
What? / Yes

389
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't understand

390
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Why is there so much chocolate here?

391
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Tendra told us to have fun

392
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But we're making chocolates

393
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's delicious

394
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Now, throw all of these chocolates away!

395
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Why are we throwing them away?

396
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The chocolate is delicious!

397
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This chocolate

398
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
will make you feel guilty

399
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you know, guys?

400
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Mike, Jack, and Tole

401
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Why did they become a band?

402
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because they ate the chocolate!

403
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you're still making chocolates,

404
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it means you're ready to be eaten by the monster!

[Previously]

409
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Go away!

410
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And bring the food

411
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The chocolate smell is so strong

412
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Do your job

413
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and destroy them!

415
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is the only way

416
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
for me to enter the station

417
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Gili Ipi!

420
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's another man!

421
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why is that man calling us?

422
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He must be working for us

423
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hey, young ladies

424
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm here

425
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
to invite you to a dance

426
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
A dance?

427
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yes

428
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The loser has to follow the winner's will

429
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
How?

430
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Why?

431
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you scared?

432
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Just dance!

433
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We're never scared

434
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
especially with men

435
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on, Gili Ipi!

436
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000

438
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Enough!

439
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I admit defeat

440
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You're really great, Putri Angsa

441
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We don't believe in men

442
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Where's the man?

443
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Now, you can punish me

444
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
with anything

445
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But please, don't put me in jail

446
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because I'm most afraid of water

447
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Especially in this lake

448
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
There's a hole that can lead to the magic village

449
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't take me there

450
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm afraid of that place

451
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm afraid of that hole

452
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He's afraid of the hole

453
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Let's just take him there

454
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So he won't be afraid

455
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because you're afraid of water

456
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and the lake

457
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We'll take you to the most secluded place

I'm scared, dad

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Zhen, you're a galaxy

467
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You should be quick

Now you have to remember, Alfa

476
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Don't you ever look at the sparkling eyes

477
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Remember, don't you ever look at the sparkling eyes

478
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Maybe the sparkling eyes are the snake eyes

479
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Guys, don't look at the snake eyes!

Yes!

He's already in the cave

Now we attack him

What happened to me?

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You were a stone!

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Enough!

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We don't want to make a scene

Let's get out of here

531

Don't be happy yet, Ava

535
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The snake doesn't die

536
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It just escapes

537
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So the snake can come back?

538
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It can come back if it smells like chocolate

539
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We should leave this place

540
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Bring the children out of the village

541
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I've found a way to get out of the village

542
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But professor

543
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What about the mantra that's blocking the village?

544
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The mantra is a sign for us

545
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Once we get out

546
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The mantra will disappear

547
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Rey!

548
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Wake up!

549
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Ava

550
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You didn't eat the monster, did you?

551
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
No

552
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Let's go

553
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Is everything messed up?

554
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What's going on?

555
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Maybe they're playing war

556
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Hurry!

557
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look!

558
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Who's playing?

559
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Three!

560
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Rey!

561
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Ava!

562
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Children

563
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Let's go back to school

Professor

565
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
How's the monster?

566
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
We managed to get rid of the monster

567
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But it's not dead yet

568
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Only escaped

569
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You have to be alert

570
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And now

571
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We have to go back to school

572
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Bring the children to a safer place

573
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But I and the teachers will come back here

574
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
To kill the monster

575
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Thank you, professor Ladebaran

576
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Rita

577
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I have to go

578
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You'll come back here, won't you?

579
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Of course

580
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But don't forget

581
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
We'll contact you through this channel

582
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This well

583
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Connects to the lake around our school

584
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And we'll go in there one by one

585
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
As soon as you get in

586
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You have to swim as fast as you can

587
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
To the lake

588
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You'll pair up

589
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And the teachers will help you

590
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Wait!

591
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Don't think you can leave this village so easily

592
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Nice to meet you, Ankara

593
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But unfortunately

594
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
We have to say goodbye

595
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Don't be arrogant, Ladebaran

596
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The science I'm in charge of

597
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Is far better than the last time we met

598
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Ankara

599
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Don't talk too much

600
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You're not even willing to defeat me

601
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
How can you defeat professor Ladebaran?

602
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Professor

603
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's better

604
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
To bring your children

605
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So that I can face this challenge

606
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That's it, let's go

607
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So that I can face this challenge

608
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Hurry up, give me the children

609
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Hurry up, let's go

610
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I haven't lost yet

611
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And I will never lose

612
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Everything is in vain

613
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm not going to lose

614
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Everyone is home

615
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm the only one left

616
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Hi, Mahfiz

617
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't want people to be in trouble because of me

618
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I have to face this

619
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You guys, don't tell anyone

620
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:04,000
We can do it

621
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Thank God, there's a crazy person in here

622
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Thank God

623
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Hurry up, there's a crazy person

624
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Hurry up, there's a crazy person in here

625
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Help

626
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Felita, what's wrong?

627
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Help, I'm scared

628
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Hello everyone

629
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Felita is in my hands

630
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And you tell Alfa

631
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
If Alfa still wants this child to live

632
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Then she has to surrender herself

633
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I don't understand

634
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's up to you to tell Alfa

635
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
The important thing is you have to find me to Ramadhan

636
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Felita and Antaboga will be waiting for you

637
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Huh? Antaboga?

638
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Your time is only 1x24 hours

639
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
If you're late

640
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Then this child will be gone forever

641
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I will return to the magic village

642
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
To lock the monster in the cave of Krama

643
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You guys take care of the children

644
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And stay alert

645
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Because Ankara won't give up so easily

646
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
He will definitely do everything

647
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm sorry, Prof

648
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But the professor can

649
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Because as far as I know

650
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
According to the legend

651
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There's a monster in the cave of Krama

652
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because as far as I know

653
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
According to the legend

654
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Only people of the five sacred tribes

655
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Can open and close the cave

656
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I will still try

657
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So that the villagers of the magic village can live in peace

658
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Alfa

659
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Don't be stubborn

660
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
If you go there alone

661
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You will be attacked by the monsters

662
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yes, sir

663
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's report it to the soldiers and the professor

664
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes

665
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They will definitely accompany you

666
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Besides

667
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
If you go with the professor

668
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You will be protected

669
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yes, sir

670
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
The professor can turn into a bird

671
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yes, sir

672
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Professor Agni can also turn into a cat

673
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The soldiers can also change

674
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
No

675
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I have to help him

676
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Alfa

677
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Don't be stubborn

678
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No

679
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I will go back alone

680
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't want people to be in danger because of me

681
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I have to be patient

682
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You guys

683
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Don't tell anyone

684
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Alfa

685
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm so scared

686
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's report it to the professor

687
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Let's go

688
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Evil

689
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You left me

690
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I can be miserable

691
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I can be in pain

692
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I can die

693
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Evil

694
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Po

695
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Evil

696
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's not working

697
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Po

698
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
What are you doing here?

699
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Po

700
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm just sitting here

701
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Why?

702
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Why is Alfa back?

703
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm looking for the treasure

704
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Do you know where it is?

705
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
What?

706
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What are you doing there?

707
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Plit is kidnapped

708
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Plit is captured

709
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I have to help her

710
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Do you know?

711
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I don't know

712
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Good

713
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Walk me there

714
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh no

715
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Alfa

716
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's so scary there

717
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
There's a ghost

718
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I have a bad experience with a ghost

719
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
What kind of experience?

720
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So

721
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That time

722
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I didn't mean to

723
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I fell into the cave

724
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I met a ghost

725
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
What?

726
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm sorry

727
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm so scared

728
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Don't be scared

729
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm here

730
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I'm sorry

731
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I didn't mean to

732
00:58:34,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm so scared

733
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The spell that was played by the dark lord

734
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Turned Antaboga into a mole

735
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
A ghost

736
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And since then

737
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I became a follower of the dark lord

738
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So, Antaboga can be a ghost

739
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
If we play the spell

740
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I can play the spell

741
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So, Antaboga likes a special music

742
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If I make a mistake, I can be cursed

743
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I can be cursed by Antaboga

744
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Teach me the spell

745
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
How?

746
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'll think about it

747
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Come on, Popo

748
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Teach me

749
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Please

750
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay, I'll teach you

751
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Seriously?

752
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Even though I don't like it

753
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Even though I'm forced to

754
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Thank you, Popo

755
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Please, God

756
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I went back to the village

757
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I was about to be kidnapped by Professor Angkara

758
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And Professor Angkara said

759
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I have to go there

760
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I can't go with him

761
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
He has to go alone

762
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Or else, he'll be cursed

763
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I can do it

764
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Yeah, I can do it

765
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Thank you for teaching me

766
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Popo was hugged

767
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
