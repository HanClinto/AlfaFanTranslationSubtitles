1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Calm down, kids

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We will find out what happened

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Megantara, it's better if you take the kids out of here

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And don't let a single kid fly

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Professor, who installed the horrible magic in this gate?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know either, Megantara

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's clear is that you can't leave this village

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And we can't enter the village

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You saved my grandpa

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because you saved my grandpa

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now you're going to be my grandpa

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The magical beam managed to defeat the monster

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And locked it in the cave

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No one knows where the cave is

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But this magic is not permanent

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the monster can be released

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we have to find out who the descendant of the magical beam is

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who can lock the monster in it

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm surprised, Dek

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How can a snake talk to you?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm surprised too

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I used to talk to a snake

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe it's the descendant of the magical beam

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nonsense, Dek

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't be the descendant of the magical beam

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm new here

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nonsense, Dek

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's possible, if you're the one who did it

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How can you lock the monster in the cave?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did your parents ever tell you about Uncle Wisdom?

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know them

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't even know who they are

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My parents said they died a good man

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're so naive

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll listen to you

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We have to break the stone

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Or we'll be locked in the cave

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want to learn too

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's learn together

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That monster is too small for me

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But it can be released by our teacher

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why is it a snake?

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You pretended to be retired

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're exaggerating

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not pretending to be retired

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It seems like they're more confident now

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because they've got a new mantra

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's good

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But we can't give up

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We have to keep an eye on these monsters

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What about Professor Purwa?

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you have any clue?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The book doesn't mention the type of monster

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The shape

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And the weakness

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How can we defeat it?

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And we can't go home

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because the village gate is cursed by a very powerful magic

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're all trapped here

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We have to find a way to escape

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alfa

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's so scary

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The teacher knows about the monster

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But he covered us so we won't be scared

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And the door is cursed by a very powerful magic

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So the students can't get out

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why Professor Albaran can't get in

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think someone's watching us

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do we do?

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The monster has attacked two students

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How long do we have to wait?

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Soon, sir

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They're trapped in the village

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All the students will turn into stone

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Including the special students

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you just have to wait

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm bored here

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to go back to school

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, we can't eat at school

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
[The teacher is angry]

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Prita, you can eat the chocolate by yourself

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, share it with me

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you want

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My chocolate! Give it back!

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Prita, what's wrong?

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My chocolate was taken by Jack and Mike

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They ran away

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a problem

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I know, but in this situation, it's still a problem

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Prita, don't be sad

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll go after them

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't worry, I'll go with you

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ray, don't be late

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Smells good

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's wrong?

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why did you stop?

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go after Jack and Mike

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, let's go

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
My stomach hurts

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mike, wait for me!

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
[The teacher is angry]

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mike?

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mike!

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's Jack's voice

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe it's another monster

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mike!

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Help!

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm scared

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Jack saw Mike being attacked

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's why he's still shocked

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, let's take them inside

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sorry, Professor Purwa

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let Mike handle it

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alfa, let's listen to this

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How?

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go inside

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Kids

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't go anywhere

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Stay here

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And always be careful

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
[The teacher is angry]

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Alfa?

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:32,000
[The teacher is angry]

139
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you okay?

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm okay

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
[The teacher is angry]

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is the maximum amount of alcohol

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you drink that, you'll be calm

144
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now tell me what happened

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just now

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was putting on my shoes

147
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And Mike ran away

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And then the monster came

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was so scared

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And then he turned into a rock

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is the first time this has happened

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Usually, students are attacked when they are happy

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Professor Agni

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's read his mind

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, Professor

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
[The teacher is angry]

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My shoes hurt

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Mike, wait for me!

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hurry!

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:41,000
[The teacher is angry]

161
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Mike!

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I like that monster

163
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It looks like the monster likes chocolate

164
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's weird

165
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How can a monster as cruel as that like chocolate?

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Wait, Professor Purwa

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have to make sure of something

168
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:55,000
[The teacher is angry]

169
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How is it, Professor Agni?

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It seems like it's true

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
When Tol is attacked

172
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There's chocolate

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes, sir

174
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And when Nick was attacked

175
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Nick was being tested

176
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He was carrying chocolate

177
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Megantara

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Go back to your students

179
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Watch them

180
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't let anyone panic

181
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And watch them

182
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't let anyone pass through the village

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It can be very dangerous for them

184
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Professor

185
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
[The teacher is angry]

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How is it, Mr. Agni?

187
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't worry

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Mr. Agni is resting

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's sleeping

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What about Mike?

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mike is being treated

192
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
With a medicine

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Aren't you afraid?

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, sir

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We're not afraid, right?

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, sir

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Good

198
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Who said we're not afraid?

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This place is getting more dangerous

200
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But it's our turn to be the bad guys

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's run away

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you agree?

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, sir

204
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Now we know the monster likes chocolate

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So we have to protect our friends

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So they won't eat chocolate

207
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I agree

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So they won't be attacked by the monster

209
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's go

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:38,000

211
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hurry up, Don!

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm late

213

[The teacher is angry]

214
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's dangerous, we have to run

215
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll go through the village gate

216
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I have to stop this

217
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The army!

218
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The army is coming!

219
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The army!

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What should we do?

221
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The army!

222
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Now

223
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's time for the monster to do its job

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:09,000
[We can do it]

225
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Wait!

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're so slow

227
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You said you're not afraid

228
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But you want to run away?

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You all go back to your house

231
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We want to go home

232
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This place is getting more dangerous

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So that's all you have?

234
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Listen

235
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're special kids

Kids who are spoiled by other kids

237
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you're afraid

238
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't have the courage

239
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What's the difference between you and other kids?

240
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you know why you're still asked to come here?

241
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Do you?

242
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Look at this

[The Black Magic]

244
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This cave is haunted by the black magic

245
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If we pass it

246
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You'll all be destroyed

247
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What should we do?

248
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We have to fight it

249
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Remember

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're special kids

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Go back to being farmers

Go back to being brave

[The Black Magic]

261
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now you know the situation

262
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But

263
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't be shocked by the situation

You have to be calmer

265
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And be ready to face it

Yes, we're scared

This fear is our enemy's target

If we're scared, the enemy will be happy

271
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But if we're happy

272
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The enemy will feel lonely

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes, sir

If necessary, destroy all the chocolate trees there

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That means...

What? / Yes

386
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't understand

387
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Why is there so much chocolate here?

388
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Tendra told us to have fun

389
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But we're making chocolates

390
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's delicious

391
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Now, throw all of these chocolates away!

392
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Why are we throwing them away?

393
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The chocolate is delicious!

394
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This chocolate

395
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
will make you feel guilty

396
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you know, guys?

397
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Mike, Jack, and Tole

398
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Why did they become a band?

399
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because they ate the chocolate!

400
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you're still making chocolates,

401
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it means you're ready to be eaten by the monster!

You're in my way!

[Previously]

406
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Go away!

407
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And bring the food

408
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The chocolate smell is so strong

409
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Do your job

410
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and destroy them!

412
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is the only way

413
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
for me to enter the station

414
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000

416
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Gili Ipi!

417
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's another man!

418
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why is that man calling us?

419
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He must be working for us

420
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hey, young ladies

421
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm here

422
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
to invite you to a dance

423
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
A dance?

424
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yes

425
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The loser has to follow the winner's will

426
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
How?

427
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Why?

428
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you scared?

429
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Just dance!

430
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We're never scared

431
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
especially with men

432
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on, Gili Ipi!

433
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000

435
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Enough!

436
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I admit defeat

437
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You're really great, Putri Angsa

438
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We don't believe in men

439
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Where's the man?

440
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Now, you can punish me

441
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
with anything

442
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But please, don't put me in jail

443
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because I'm most afraid of water

444
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Especially in this lake

445
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
There's a hole that can lead to the magic village

446
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't take me there

447
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm afraid of that place

448
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm afraid of that hole

449
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He's afraid of the hole

450
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Let's just take him there

451
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So he won't be afraid

452
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Because you're afraid of water

453
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and the lake

454
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We'll take you to the most secluded place

I'm scared, dad

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Zhen, you're a galaxy

464
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You should be quick

I'm scared, dad

Now you have to remember, Alfa

473
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Don't you ever look at the sparkling eyes

474
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Remember, don't you ever look at the sparkling eyes

475
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Maybe the sparkling eyes are the snake eyes

476
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Guys, don't look at the snake eyes!

Yes!

Now we attack him

What happened to me?

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You were a stone!

Let's get out of here

Don't be happy yet, Ava

532
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The snake doesn't die

533
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It just escapes

534
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So the snake can come back?

535
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It can come back if it smells like chocolate

536
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We should leave this place

537
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Bring the children out of the village

538
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I've found a way to get out of the village

539
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But professor

540
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What about the mantra that's blocking the village?

541
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The mantra is a sign for us

542
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Once we get out

543
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The mantra will disappear

544
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Rey!

545
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Wake up!

546
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Ava

547
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You didn't eat the monster, did you?

548
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
No

549
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Let's go

550
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Is everything messed up?

551
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What's going on?

552
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Maybe they're playing war

553
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Hurry!

554
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Look!

555
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Who's playing?

556
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Three!

557
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Rey!

558
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Ava!

559
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Children

560
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Let's go back to school

Professor

562
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
How's the monster?

563
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
We managed to get rid of the monster

564
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But it's not dead yet

565
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Only escaped

566
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You have to be alert

567
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And now

568
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We have to go back to school

569
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Bring the children to a safer place

570
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But I and the teachers will come back here

571
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
To kill the monster

572
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Thank you, professor Ladebaran

573
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Rita

574
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I have to go

575
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You'll come back here, won't you?

576
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Of course

577
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But don't forget

578
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
We'll contact you through this channel

579
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This well

580
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Connects to the lake around our school

581
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And we'll go in there one by one

582
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
As soon as you get in

583
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You have to swim as fast as you can

584
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
To the lake

585
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You'll pair up

586
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And the teachers will help you

587
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Wait!

588
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Don't think you can leave this village so easily

589
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Nice to meet you, Ankara

590
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But unfortunately

591
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
We have to say goodbye

592
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Don't be arrogant, Ladebaran

593
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The science I'm in charge of

594
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Is far better than the last time we met

595
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Ankara

596
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Don't talk too much

597
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You're not even willing to defeat me

598
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
How can you defeat professor Ladebaran?

599
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Professor

600
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's better

601
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
To bring your children

602
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So that I can face this challenge

603
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That's it, let's go

604
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So that I can face this challenge

605
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Hurry up, give me the children

606
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Hurry up, let's go

607
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I haven't lost yet

608
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And I will never lose

609
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Everything is in vain

610
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm not going to lose

611
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Everyone is home

612
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm the only one left

613
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Hi, Mahfiz

614
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't want people to be in trouble because of me

615
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I have to face this

616
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You guys, don't tell anyone

617
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:04,000
We can do it

618
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Thank God, there's a crazy person in here

619
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Thank God

620
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Hurry up, there's a crazy person

621
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Hurry up, there's a crazy person in here

622
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Help

623
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Felita, what's wrong?

624
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Help, I'm scared

625
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Hello everyone

626
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Felita is in my hands

627
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And you tell Alfa

628
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
If Alfa still wants this child to live

629
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Then she has to surrender herself

630
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I don't understand

631
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's up to you to tell Alfa

632
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
The important thing is you have to find me to Ramadhan

633
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Felita and Antaboga will be waiting for you

634
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Huh? Antaboga?

635
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Your time is only 1x24 hours

636
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
If you're late

637
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Then this child will be gone forever

638
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I will return to the magic village

639
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
To lock the monster in the cave of Krama

640
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You guys take care of the children

641
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And stay alert

642
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Because Ankara won't give up so easily

643
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
He will definitely do everything

644
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm sorry, Prof

645
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But the professor can

646
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Because as far as I know

647
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
According to the legend

648
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There's a monster in the cave of Krama

649
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because as far as I know

650
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
According to the legend

651
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Only people of the five sacred tribes

652
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Can open and close the cave

653
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I will still try

654
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So that the villagers of the magic village can live in peace

655
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Alfa

656
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Don't be stubborn

657
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
If you go there alone

658
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You will be attacked by the monsters

659
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yes, sir

660
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's report it to the soldiers and the professor

661
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes

662
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They will definitely accompany you

663
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Besides

664
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
If you go with the professor

665
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You will be protected

666
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yes, sir

667
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
The professor can turn into a bird

668
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yes, sir

669
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Professor Agni can also turn into a cat

670
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The soldiers can also change

671
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
No

672
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I have to help him

673
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Alfa

674
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Don't be stubborn

675
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No

676
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I will go back alone

677
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't want people to be in danger because of me

678
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I have to be patient

679
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You guys

680
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Don't tell anyone

681
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Alfa

682
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm so scared

683
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's report it to the professor

684
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Let's go

685
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Evil

686
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You left me

687
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I can be miserable

688
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I can be in pain

689
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I can die

690
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Evil

691
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Po

692
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Evil

693
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's not working

694
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Po

695
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
What are you doing here?

696
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Po

697
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm just sitting here

698
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Why?

699
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Why is Alfa back?

700
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm looking for the treasure

701
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Do you know where it is?

702
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
What?

703
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What are you doing there?

704
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Plit is kidnapped

705
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Plit is captured

706
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I have to help her

707
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Do you know?

708
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I don't know

709
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Good

710
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Walk me there

711
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh no

712
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Alfa

713
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's so scary there

714
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
There's a ghost

715
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I have a bad experience with a ghost

716
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
What kind of experience?

717
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So

718
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That time

719
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I didn't mean to

720
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I fell into the cave

721
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I met a ghost

722
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
What?

723
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm sorry

724
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm so scared

725
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Don't be scared

726
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm here

727
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I'm sorry

728
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I didn't mean to

729
00:58:34,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm so scared

730
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The spell that was played by the dark lord

731
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Turned Antaboga into a mole

732
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
A ghost

733
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And since then

734
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I became a follower of the dark lord

735
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So, Antaboga can be a ghost

736
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
If we play the spell

737
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I can play the spell

738
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So, Antaboga likes a special music

739
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If I make a mistake, I can be cursed

740
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I can be cursed by Antaboga

741
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Teach me the spell

742
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
How?

743
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'll think about it

744
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Come on, Popo

745
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Teach me

746
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Please

747
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay, I'll teach you

748
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Seriously?

749
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Even though I don't like it

750
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Even though I'm forced to

751
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Thank you, Popo

752
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Please, God

753
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I went back to the village

754
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I was about to be kidnapped by Professor Angkara

755
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And Professor Angkara said

756
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I have to go there

757
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I can't go with him

758
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
He has to go alone

759
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Or else, he'll be cursed

760
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I can do it

761
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Yeah, I can do it

762
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Thank you for teaching me

763
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Popo was hugged

764
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Usually, all gods treat Popo with love

765
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Isn't it supposed to be a fun trip?

766
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
What do you know, Jani?

767
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Unfortunately, you're too late to know

768
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find your friends

769
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Run, jump, jump, climb the stars
