 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 To be continued...

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Calm down, kids

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We will find out what happened

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Megantara, it's better if you take the kids out of here

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And don't let a single kid fly

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Professor, who installed the horrible magic in this gate?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I don't know either, Megantara

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 What's clear is that you can't leave this village

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And we can't enter the village

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 You saved my grandpa

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Because you saved my grandpa

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Now you're going to be my grandpa

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 The magical beam managed to defeat the monster

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And locked it in the cave

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 No one knows where the cave is

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 But this magic is not permanent

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 So the monster can be released

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And we have to find out who the descendant of the magical beam is

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Who can lock the monster in it

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I'm surprised, Dek

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 How can a snake talk to you?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I'm surprised too

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But I used to talk to a snake

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Maybe it's the descendant of the magical beam

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Nonsense, Dek

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I can't be the descendant of the magical beam

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I'm new here

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Nonsense, Dek

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's possible, if you're the one who did it

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 How can you lock the monster in the cave?

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Did your parents ever tell you about Uncle Wisdom?

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I don't know them

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I don't even know who they are

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 My parents said they died a good man

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 You're so naive

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I'll listen to you

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 We have to break the stone

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Or we'll be locked in the cave

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I want to learn too

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Let's learn together

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 That monster is too small for me

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But it can be released by our teacher

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Why is it a snake?

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 You pretended to be retired

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 You're exaggerating

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I'm not pretending to be retired

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 It seems like they're more confident now

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Because they've got a new mantra

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 That's good

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 But we can't give up

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 We have to keep an eye on these monsters

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 What about Professor Purwa?

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Do you have any clue?

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 No

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 The book doesn't mention the type of monster

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 The shape

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And the weakness

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 How can we defeat it?

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And we can't go home

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Because the village gate is cursed by a very powerful magic

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 We're all trapped here

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 We have to find a way to escape

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Alva

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 It's so scary

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Why?

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 The teacher knows about the monster

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 But he covered us so we won't be scared

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And the door is cursed by a very powerful magic

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So the students can't get out

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 That's why Professor Albaran can't get in

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I think someone's watching us

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 What do we do?

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 What do we do?

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 The monster has attacked two students

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 How long do we have to wait?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Soon, sir

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 They're trapped in the village

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 All the students will turn into stone

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Including the special students

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So you just have to wait

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 I'm bored here

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I want to go back to school

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Yes, we can't eat at school

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Yes

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 [The teacher is angry]

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Prita, you can eat the chocolate by yourself

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Yes, share it with me

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 If you want

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 My chocolate! Give it back!

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 My chocolate! Give it back!

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Prita, what's wrong?

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 My chocolate was taken by Jack and Mike

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 They ran away

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 That's a problem

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I know, but in this situation, it's still a problem

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Prita, don't be sad

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I'll go after them

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Don't worry, I'll go with you

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Ray, don't be late

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Smells good

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 What's wrong?

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Why did you stop?

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Let's go after Jack and Mike

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Okay, let's go

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 My stomach hurts

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Mike, wait for me!

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 [The teacher is angry]

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Mike?

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Mike!

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 That's Jack's voice

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Maybe it's another monster

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Let's go

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Mike!

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Help!

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Help!

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I'm scared

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Jack saw Mike being attacked

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 That's why he's still shocked

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Okay, let's take them inside

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Sorry, Professor Purwa

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Let Mike handle it

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Okay

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Alva, let's listen to this

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 How?

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Let's go inside

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Kids

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Don't go anywhere

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Stay here

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And always be careful

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 [The teacher is angry]

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 [The teacher is angry]

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Alva?

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Alva?

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 [The teacher is angry]

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 [The teacher is angry]

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 [The teacher is angry]

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 [The teacher is angry]

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 [The teacher is angry]

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 [The teacher is angry]

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Are you okay?

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I'm okay

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 [The teacher is angry]

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 This is the maximum amount of alcohol

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 If you drink that, you'll be calm

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Now tell me what happened

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Just now

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I was putting on my shoes

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And Mike ran away

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And then the monster came

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 I was so scared

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And then he turned into a rock

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 This is the first time this has happened

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Usually, students are attacked when they are happy

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Professor Agni

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Let's read his mind

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Okay, Professor

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 [The teacher is angry]

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 My shoes hurt

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Mike, wait for me!

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Hurry!

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000

 [The teacher is angry]

180

 Mike!

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I like that monster

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It looks like the monster likes chocolate

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 That's weird

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 How can a monster as cruel as that like chocolate?

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Wait, Professor Purwa

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I have to make sure of something

187
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000

 [The teacher is angry]

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 How is it, Professor Agni?

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 It seems like it's true

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 When Tol is attacked

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 There's chocolate

194
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Yes, sir

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And when Nick was attacked

196
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Nick was being tested

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 He was carrying chocolate

199
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Go back to your students

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Watch them

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Don't let anyone panic

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And watch them

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Don't let anyone pass through the village

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It can be very dangerous for them

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Yes, Professor

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 [The teacher is angry]

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 How is it, Mr. Agni?

208
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Don't worry

209
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Mr. Agni is resting

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 He's sleeping

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 What about Mike?

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Mike is being treated

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 With a medicine

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Aren't you afraid?

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 No, sir

216
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 We're not afraid, right?

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Yes, sir

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Good

219
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Who said we're not afraid?

220
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 This place is getting more dangerous

221
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But it's our turn to be the bad guys

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Let's run away

 Yes, sir

225
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Now we know the monster likes chocolate

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So we have to protect our friends

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 So they won't eat chocolate

228
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 I agree

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 So they won't be attacked by the monster

230
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000

 Do you?

 If we pass it

 What should we do?

 But if we're happy

 What's this?

 This is a communication mirror

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 If necessary, destroy all the chocolate trees there

376
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 So the villagers can't make chocolates anymore

 Yes, sir

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Popo, what are you doing here?

389
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Milk?

390
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 What?

391
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Kawat, Kawat!

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 We're all in danger!

393
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Danger? What do you mean, Popo?

394
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Those stupid children

395
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Popo taught them how to make chocolates

396
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Children? Who are you?

397
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I'm their friend

398
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 But they're so stupid

399
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Mega!

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Mega!

401
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Those children are making chocolates

402
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 What? Chocolates?

403
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 That means...

404
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 That means the monster is coming

405
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Yes, we're in danger

406
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 We have to stop it

407
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Let's go

408
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 It's a monster!

409
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Popo, run!

410
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 This looks good

411
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Popo!

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Tommy, Tommy! Don't eat the chocolate!

413
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Hurry, throw it away!

414
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 We're tired of making chocolates

415
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Then, why did you tell us to throw it away?

416
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 We don't know!

417
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Tommy, Jack, this chocolate is dangerous

418
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 This chocolate can lure the monster here

419
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Don't lie!

420
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 There's no monster that likes chocolate

421
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 It's you!

422
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Guys, take care of the chocolate

423
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Don't let Alva eat it

424
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Why? You don't want to tell us?

425
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Go away!

426
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Go away!

429
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Why is there a smell of chocolate here?

430
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Yes, Tendra, they're making chocolates

431
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 What? / Yes

432
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I don't understand

433
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Why is there so much chocolate here?

434
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Tendra told us to have fun

435
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 But we're making chocolates

436
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 It's delicious

437
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Now, throw all of these chocolates away!

438
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Why are we throwing them away?

439
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 The chocolate is delicious!

440
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 This chocolate

441
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 will make you feel guilty

442
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Do you know, guys?

443
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Mike, Jack, and Tole

444
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Why did they become a band?

445
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Because they ate the chocolate!

446
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 If you're still making chocolates,

447
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 it means you're ready to be eaten by the monster!

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 [The dragon]

579
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 [The dragon]

580
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 I'm going after the dragon!

581
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 [The dragon]

582
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 [The dragon]

583
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 [The dragon]

584
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Happy Eid!

585
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 I'm glad I'm not a stone yet, Alva

586
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 [The dragon]

587
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 [The dragon]

588
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 [The dragon]

589
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 [The dragon]

590
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 [The dragon]

591
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 [The dragon]

592
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 [The dragon]

593
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 [The dragon]

594
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 [The dragon]

595
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 [The dragon]

596
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Mike!

597
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 You!

598
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Mike!

599
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 How did you become a stone?

600
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Anis also became a stone

601
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 You!

602
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Hey!

603
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 He's already in the cave

604
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Now we attack him

605
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 In the village!

606
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 [The dragon]

607
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 [The dragon]

608
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 [The dragon]

609
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 [The dragon]

610
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 [The dragon]

611
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Why are you two here?

612
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 Praise be to God!

613
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 Normal quest

614
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Normal?

615
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 What happened to me?

616
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 You were a stone!

617
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Enough!

618
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 We don't want to make a scene

619
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 Let's get out of here

620
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 Let's go!

621
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 [The dragon]

622
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Sir, it's amazing!

623
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Don't be happy yet, Ava

624
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 The snake doesn't die

625
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 It just escapes

626
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 So the snake can come back?

627
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 It can come back if it smells like chocolate

628
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 We should leave this place

629
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Bring the children out of the village

630
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 I've found a way to get out of the village

631
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 But professor

632
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 What about the mantra that's blocking the village?

633
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 The mantra is a sign for us

634
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Once we get out

635
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 The mantra will disappear

636
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 Rey!

637
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Wake up!

638
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 Wake up!

639
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Ava

640
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 You didn't eat the monster, did you?

641
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 No

642
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 Let's go

643
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Is everything messed up?

644
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 What's going on?

645
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 Maybe they're playing war

646
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Hurry!

647
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 Look!

648
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 Who's playing?

649
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 Three!

650
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 Rey!

651
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Ava!

652
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Children

653
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Let's go back to school

654
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Professor

655
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 How's the monster?

656
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 We managed to get rid of the monster

657
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 But it's not dead yet

658
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Only escaped

659
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 You have to be alert

660
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 And now

661
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 We have to go back to school

662
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Bring the children to a safer place

663
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 But I and the teachers will come back here

664
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 To kill the monster

665
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Thank you, professor Ladebaran

666
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 Rita

667
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 I have to go

668
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 You'll come back here, won't you?

669
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 Of course

670
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 But don't forget

671
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 We'll contact you through this channel

672
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 To be continued...

673
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 To be continued...

674
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000

675

 To be continued...

680
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 To be continued...

681
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 This well

682
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Connects to the lake around our school

683
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 And we'll go in there one by one

684
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 As soon as you get in

685
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 You have to swim as fast as you can

686
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 To the lake

687
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 You'll pair up

688
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 And the teachers will help you

689
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 To be continued...

690
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Wait!

691
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 Don't think you can leave this village so easily

692
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 Nice to meet you, Ankara

693
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 But unfortunately

694
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 We have to say goodbye

695
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 Don't be arrogant, Ladebaran

696
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 The science I'm in charge of

697
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 Is far better than the last time we met

698
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Ankara

699
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Don't talk too much

700
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 You're not even willing to defeat me

701
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 How can you defeat professor Ladebaran?

702
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Professor

703
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 It's better

704
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 To bring your children

705
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 So that I can face this challenge

706
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 To be continued...

707
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000

 To be continued...

722
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 To be continued...

723
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 That's it, let's go

724
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 So that I can face this challenge

725
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Hurry up, give me the children

726
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 Hurry up, let's go

727
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 To be continued...

728
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 To be continued...

729
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 To be continued...

730
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 I haven't lost yet

731
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 And I will never lose

732
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 Everything is in vain

733
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 I'm not going to lose

734
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 I'm not going to lose

735
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 I'm not going to lose

736
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 I'm not going to lose

737
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 I'm not going to lose

738
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 I'm not going to lose

739
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 I'm not going to lose

740
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 I'm not going to lose

741
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 Everyone is home

742
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 I'm the only one left

743
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 Hi, Mahfiz

744
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 I don't want people to be in trouble because of me

745
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 I have to face this

746
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 You guys, don't tell anyone

747
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 We can do it

748
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 We can do it

749
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 Thank God, there's a crazy person in here

750
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 Thank God

751
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 Hurry up, there's a crazy person

752
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 Hurry up, there's a crazy person in here

753
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 Help

754
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 Felita, what's wrong?

755
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 Help, I'm scared

756
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 Hello everyone

757
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 Felita is in my hands

758
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 And you tell Alva

759
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 If Alva still wants this child to live

760
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 Then she has to surrender herself

761
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 I don't understand

762
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 It's up to you to tell Alva

763
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 The important thing is you have to find me to Ramadhan

764
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 Felita and Antaboga will be waiting for you

765
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 Huh? Antaboga?

766
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 Your time is only 1x24 hours

767
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 If you're late

768
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 Then this child will be gone forever

769
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 I will return to the magic village

770
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 To lock the monster in the cave of Krama

771
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
 You guys take care of the children

772
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 And stay alert

773
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 Because Ankara won't give up so easily

774
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 He will definitely do everything

775
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 I'm sorry, Prof

776
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 But the professor can

777
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 Because as far as I know

778
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 According to the legend

779
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 There's a monster in the cave of Krama

780
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 Because as far as I know

781
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 According to the legend

782
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 Only people of the five sacred tribes

783
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 Can open and close the cave

784
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 I will still try

785
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 So that the villagers of the magic village can live in peace

786
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 Alva

787
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 Don't be stubborn

788
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 If you go there alone

789
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 You will be attacked by the monsters

790
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 Yes, sir

791
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 Let's report it to the soldiers and the professor

792
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 Yes

793
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 They will definitely accompany you

794
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 Besides

795
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 If you go with the professor

796
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 You will be protected

797
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 Yes, sir

798
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 The professor can turn into a bird

799
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 Yes, sir

800
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 Professor Agni can also turn into a cat

801
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 The soldiers can also change

802
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 No

803
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 I have to help him

804
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 Alva

805
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 Don't be stubborn

806
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 No

807
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 I will go back alone

808
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 I don't want people to be in danger because of me

809
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 I have to be patient

810
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 You guys

811
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 Don't tell anyone

812
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 Alva

813
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 Alva

814
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 I'm so scared

815
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 Let's report it to the professor

816
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 Let's go

817
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 Evil

818
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 You left me

819
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 I can be miserable

820
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 I can be in pain

821
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 I can die

822
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 Evil

823
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 Evil

824
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 Evil

825
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 Evil

826
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Evil

827
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 Evil

828
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 Po

829
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 Evil

830
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 It's not working

831
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 Po

832
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
 What are you doing here?

833
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 Po

834
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 I'm just sitting here

835
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 Why?

836
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 Why is Alva back?

837
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 I'm looking for the treasure

838
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 Do you know where it is?

839
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 What?

840
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 What are you doing there?

841
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 Plit is kidnapped

842
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 Plit is captured

843
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 I have to help her

844
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 Do you know?

845
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 I don't know

846
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 Good

847
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 Walk me there

848
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
 Oh no

849
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 Alva

850
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 It's so scary there

851
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 There's a ghost

852
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 I have a bad experience with a ghost

853
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 What kind of experience?

854
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 So

855
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 That time

856
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 I didn't mean to

857
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 I fell into the cave

858
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
 I met a ghost

859
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 What?

860
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 I'm sorry

861
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 I'm so scared

862
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 Don't be scared

863
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 I'm here

864
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 I'm sorry

865
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 I didn't mean to

866
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 I'm so scared

867
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 I'm so scared

868
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 I'm so scared

869
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
 I'm so scared

870
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 I'm so scared

871
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 I'm so scared

872
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
 I'm so scared

873
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 I'm so scared

874
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 I'm so scared

875
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 I'm so scared

876
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 The spell that was played by the dark lord

877
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 Turned Antaboga into a mole

878
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 A ghost

879
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 And since then

880
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 I became a follower of the dark lord

881
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 So, Antaboga can be a ghost

882
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
 If we play the spell

883
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 I can play the spell

884
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 I can play the spell

885
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
 So, Antaboga likes a special music

886
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 If I make a mistake, I can be cursed

887
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
 I can be cursed by Antaboga

888
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 Teach me the spell

889
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 How?

890
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 I'll think about it

891
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
 Come on, Popo

892
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 Teach me

893
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 Please

894
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 Okay, I'll teach you

895
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 Seriously?

896
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 Even though I don't like it

897
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
 Even though I'm forced to

898
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 Thank you, Popo

899
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 Please, God

900
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 I went back to the village

901
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
 I was about to be kidnapped by Professor Angkara

902
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 And Professor Angkara said

903
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 I have to go there

904
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
 I can't go with him

905
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 He has to go alone

906
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 Or else, he'll be cursed

907
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 I can do it

908
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 Yeah, I can do it

909
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 Thank you for teaching me

910
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
 Popo was hugged

911
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Usually, all gods treat Popo with love

912
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 Isn't it supposed to be a fun trip?

913
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 What do you know, Jani?

914
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 Unfortunately, you're too late to know

915
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
 [Music]

916
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find your friends

917
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 Run, jump, jump, climb the stars

918
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:59,000
 Be brave, don't give up

919
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 Chase your dreams

920
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

921
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

922
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

923
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

924
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

925
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 Go, go, go, we will
