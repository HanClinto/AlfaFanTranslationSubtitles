 To be continued...

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, don't ever stop

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, be brave with your heart

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I need your help

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You're looking for Edward, right?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Because I'm sure he can help you defeat the Dark Lord

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Yes, I'm looking for him

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And you know why the Dark Lord can't kill you when you're still a baby?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Because you're Alva's chosen child

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 No!

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Yes! I got the book!

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Finally we got this famous "Escape" sword

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Get down, get down!

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Before I find a way to break this sword

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I will plant the sun flower

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 How's it going, guys? Have you found anything?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 We've been looking for everywhere and found nothing, Prof

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Yes, Prof, our eyes were even blinded

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But it's the same, there's no black smoke, Prof

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Yes, Prof, we've been looking everywhere but there's nothing

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 That's weird, why is there nothing?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 What's possible? Yasmin is wrong

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Professor Aldebaran

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Agni, what's waiting for me?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 The sword, the sword is gone, Prof

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 My sword? How can it be gone?

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I don't know, Prof

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 The professor's room is also messy

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It's like someone just came in from here

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 That's weird

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Agni, where's Yasmin? I want to talk to her

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Yasmin is in her room, Prof

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 She was injured because she was attacked by a unicorn in the forest

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Agni, Yasmin is not the same person who was in the forest

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 That's right, Prof

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But she was in my room

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 That's impossible, Prof, that's impossible

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Yasmin was with us, we were in the forest looking for the angel fruit

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 That's weird, that means the one who met me was not Yasmin

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Someone is playing with me

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:21,120
 (music intensifies)

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 GO IN.

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:33,480
 (music intensifies)

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 Why haven't you waited for me?

58
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,480
 (music intensifies)

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
 GO IN.

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
 (music intensifies)

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
 (grunt)

62
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
 (music intensifies)

63
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,480
 (music intensifies)

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
 Come on girls, let's find the flower seeds of that day.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
 Come on.

66
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 (music intensifies)

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
 The seeds are not growing.

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
 What should we do?

69
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 Girls, calm down.

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 The seeds won't grow unless we plant them ourselves.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 Wow, this must be the work of that unicorn.

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
 We have to lure him here.

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
 Yes, even if he comes here,

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 can we beat him?

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 (music intensifies)

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 You guys just passed out

77
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,480
 because you were attacked by a unicorn.

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 Right?

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,480
 Now all of you say thank you to Alva

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 because he has helped and fought for his soul and body.

81
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 He brought Fruit Angel here.

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
 (grunt)

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
 Alva!

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
 We have to find Alva.

85
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 (music intensifies)

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
 How is it?

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
 Any news?

88
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
 The girls and the students have recovered, Professor.

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,480
 But we have a new problem.

90
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 What is it?

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
 You said just the name of the flower that was lost.

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 There's more, Professor.

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
 (music intensifies)

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,480
 Ankara has managed to escape from the prison of the devil.

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 (music intensifies)

96
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,480
 (music intensifies)

97
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
 Hi, Ketri and Samsa.

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
 Hello, Vega.

99
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,480
 (music intensifies)

100
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 There she is, Alva.

101
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
 Wow, she's also with Ketri.

102
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
 Samsa!

103
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
 Samsa, why are you here?

104
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
 You said you don't like men.

105
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 Yeah, right.

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,480
 Then, don't fight with men.

107
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,480
 So we can't hide.

108
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,480
 I do hate men.

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 But I need Alva.

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,480
 (music intensifies)

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
 What's the matter?

112
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,480
 Alva, I heard you can beat the unicorn.

113
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,480
 So I came here to ask for your help to catch the unicorn.

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 To take the key to our sun.

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
 Sorry, Garis Putriangsa.

116
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 We're not here to help you.

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
 We have other problems.

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 We're looking for the unicorn.

119
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
 That's right.

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
 We still have a lot of...

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
 ...missions.

122
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
 Go away!

123
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,480
 (music intensifies)

124
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,480
 If you want to help us...

125
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
 ...to get the key to our sun...

126
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,480
 ...we'll help you to get the unicorn.

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
 What do you want to get?

128
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 (music intensifies)

129
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,480
 (music intensifies)

130
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,480
 (music intensifies)

131
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
 So...

132
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 ...the sunflower seeds can only be found by the big guys.

133
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,480
 (music intensifies)

134
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,480
 I have to find them all.

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,480
 (music intensifies)

136
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,480
 (music intensifies)

137
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,480
 There's another one!

138
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
 Help!

139
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:51,480
 (music intensifies)

140
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 (whistles)

141
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,480
 (music intensifies)

142
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
 The unicorn!

143
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,480
 (music intensifies)

144
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
 (screams)

145
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
 Help!

146
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
 (screams)

147
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,480
 (music intensifies)

148
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
 (screams)

149
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
 (screams)

150
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
 Let go of me!

151
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
 Let go of me!

152
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
 Let go!

153
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
 You're so mean!

154
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
 (music intensifies)

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
 Okay, we'll help you.

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,480
 (music intensifies)

157
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
 Okay, let's go.

158
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
 I want to come with you.

159
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 Me too.

160
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
 You can't come with us.

161
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,480
 Only Alva, Vega, and this little girl can come with us.

162
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 Go!

163
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 (whines)

164
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:14,480
 (music intensifies)

165
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 Okay, let's go.

166
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
 I want to come with you!

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
 I can't wait.

168
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
 I want to come with you.

169
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 (music intensifies)

170
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 (laughs)

171
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
 Mr. Pancik, I'm hungry.

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
 What?

173
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
 Mr. Pancik?

174
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
 What's that?

175
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
 My name is...

176
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
 Professor Silita's daughter.

177
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
 She looks just like you.

178
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 Pretty Silita.

179
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
 Pretty girl.

180
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
 Who are you? I forgot.

181
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,480
 (music intensifies)

182
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
 Pretty girl.

183
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 Pretty girl.

184
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
 Can I come with you?

185
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
 Can I?

186
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
 Okay.

187
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,480
 (music intensifies)

188
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 (laughs)

189
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
 You're funny.

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,480
 Where's that big creature from, Professor?

386
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
 Maybe...

387
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
 the monster is the dark wizard.

388
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
 I'll attack him.

389
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
 Let's go, Prof.

390
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
 BoBoBop!

391
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 Be careful, Prof.

392
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:06,480
 It didn't work.

393
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
 Let me try.

394
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
 What's wrong, Tol?

395
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
 Divinju!

396
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,480
 Professor, the monster is very strong.

397
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
 You'd better ask for help.

398
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
 It's dangerous.

399
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
 Come here, Prof.

400
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
 Okay, Prof.

401
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
 Attack him again.

402
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
 Airborne!

403
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
 Beeping Shot!

404
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
 Divinju!

405
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
 BoBoBop!

406
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,480
 Airborne!

407
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
 BoBoBop!

408
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
 Airborne!

409
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
 BoBoBop!

410
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
 Airborne!

411
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
 Divinju!

412
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
 Airborne!

413
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,480
 Divinju!

414
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,480
 Why did you attack my friend?

415
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 I don't know.

416
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
 Why did you attack another friend?

417
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
 That's my girlfriend.

418
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
 What?

419
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
 Girlfriend?

420
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
 What's wrong with her?

421
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
 Where's my husband?

422
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 Buy the ribbon.

423
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 Buy the jiruji.

424
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
 They're right.

425
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
 The monster is my girlfriend.

426
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,480
 Girlfriend?

427
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,480
 Bargi?

428
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
 Husband?

429
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,480
 Husband?

430
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
 Who's that?

431
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
 This is...

432
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 Angsa's daughter.

433
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
 Who?

434
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
 This is Angsa's daughter who's injured.

435
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
 Yes.

436
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
 We just saved her.

437
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
 She's not my girlfriend.

438
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
 Calm down, Bargi.

439
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
 What are you doing here?

440
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
 I told you to stay home.

441
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 Let's go to the clinic.

442
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
 Okay.

443
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
 Husband!

444
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
 Wait!

445
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,480
 So, the seeds of the sun...

446
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
 can only be planted by Angsa's daughters.

447
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
 Hold this.

448
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
 Professor.

449
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 The kids want to talk to you.

450
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
 What's wrong?

451
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,480
 So, this is it.

452
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,480
 The unicorn is the monster of the eighth prince.

453
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
 First,

454
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,480
 it took the flowers.

455
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 And then,

456
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
 it kidnapped Angsa.

457
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,480
 Oh my God.

458
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
 They kidnapped everyone?

459
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
 Yes, Professor.

460
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,480
 Only Angsa's daughter managed to save us.

461
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
 From now on,

462
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,480
 the eighth prince will not be left alone.

463
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,480
 In my opinion,

464
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,480
 he knows that the soul stone is in the sun flower.

465
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
 And the seeds of the sun flower can only be planted by Angsa's daughters.

466
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,480
 The sun flower is a very strong flower.

467
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 Once it's planted,

468
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
 it will never wither.

469
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
 And it will never die.

470
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
 Even if it's destroyed.

471
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,480
 That's why,

472
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 the eighth prince...

473
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
 wants the seeds of the sun flower...

474
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 to grow into a sun flower.

475
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
 So, the unicorn's stone in the sun flower...

476
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
 will never be destroyed.

477
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
 That means,

478
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
 we have to protect Angsa's daughter.

479
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 And we can't be kidnapped by the eighth prince.

480
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
 Yes, Alva.

481
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
 We protect each other.

482
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,480
 Are you ready?

483
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 I'm ready, Professor.

484
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,480
 And one more thing.

485
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,480
 You, Alva, Vega, and Purita.

486
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,480
 Now you have to continue your studies.

487
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,480
 Even though you've helped a lot in finding the soul stone,

488
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
 but you have to remember,

489
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
 education is number one.

490
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
 That's right.

491
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
 Yes, Professor.

492
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:33,480
 Where am I?

493
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:41,480
 There's a man!

494
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
 This is for you.

495
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
 Of course.

496
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,480
 Thank you.

497
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
 The flower is beautiful.

498
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,480
 The chocolate.

499
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:11,480
 The chocolate makes me want to swim.

500
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
 I really like this chocolate.

501
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 If you want to join us again,

502
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,480
 there are so many places outside the classroom.

503
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
 Really?

504
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
 Yes.

505
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
 Let's go.

506
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,480
 Come on.

507
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:41,480
 My husband's hair.

508
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
 Why is it so far?

509
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
 We're almost there.

510
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
 There are a lot of flowers and chocolates for you.

511
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
 You must be bored.

512
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
 Okay, be patient.

513
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 Okay, let's go.

514
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:08,480
 Wow, there are so many.

515
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
 You're so kind.

516
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 Thank you.

517
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
 (The flower is beautiful.)

518
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,480
 (The chocolate makes me want to swim.)

519
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
 (The chocolate makes me want to swim.)

520
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
 You're as bad as ever.

521
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,480
 Don't run.

522
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,480
 Don't run.

523
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
 I'll get mad.

524
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,480
 Class!

525
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,480
 Help!

526
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
 Help!

527
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
 Help!

528
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
 Help!

529
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
 Don't run!

530
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,480
 Don't run!

531
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
 Help!

532
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
 Help!

533
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
 Help!

534
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 Oh, no.

535
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
 You made me panic.

536
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
 It's not Mr. M58.

537
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
 It's Bargi.

538
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
 Bargi.

539
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
 I'm mad at you.

540
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
 I'm so mad.

541
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,480
 Why did you scare Putri Angsa?

542
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
 You hate her?

543
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
 Bad girl.

544
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
 No, Bargi.

545
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
 She's beautiful.

546
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
 Bad.

547
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
 Beautiful.

548
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
 Bad.

549
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
 Ouch.

550
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,480
 I...

551
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
 I'm mad.

552
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:27,480
 Hi, Bargi.

553
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
 I'm Angkara.

554
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
 I don't know you.

555
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
 You may not know me, Bargi.

556
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,480
 But you must know the 8th Prince.

557
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,480
 Listen, Bargi.

558
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,480
 The 8th Prince wants to make a promise with you.

559
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
 What promise?

560
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,480
 He will take away the curse on you.

561
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
 And you will be a beautiful princess again.

562
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
 Bargi.

563
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
 A beautiful princess?

564
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
 But there's a condition, Bargi.

565
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
 What's the condition?

566
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,480
 You must catch and hand over Putri Angsa to the 8th Prince.

567
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
 What do you think, Bargi?

568
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
 Do you agree?

569
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
 Liar.

570
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
 I don't believe you.

571
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,480
 You must hand over the 8th Prince to the 8th Prince.

572
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,480
 And he can do whatever he wants.

573
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,480
 And remember, Bargi.

574
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,480
 If you become a beautiful princess again...

575
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,480
 ...I will automatically choose you from Putri Angsa.

576
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,480
 Forgive me, Bargi.

577
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,480
 Forgive me for having betrayed you.

578
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,480
 Now...

579
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
 Will you marry me?

580
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,480
 Bargi is happy.

581
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,480
 What?

582
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
 Answer me, Bargi.

583
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
 Don't just smile.

584
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,480
 I'm ready, Bargi.

585
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
 I'm ready.

586
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,480
 Hazil!

587
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
 Uncle, it's Bargi!

588
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
 Watch out, Bargi.

589
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,480
 If you touch Putri Angsa's wound...

590
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480
 ...we can...

591
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,480
 ...we can...

592
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,480
 ...we can...

593
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,480
 It's already late.

594
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
 You should sleep.

595
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
 I want to rest.

596
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
 No.

597
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
 I want to leave this place.

598
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
 This place is not safe.

599
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,480
 Don't go.

600
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
 It's more dangerous.

601
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,480
 Putri Angsa.

602
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,480
 What if you get caught by the Unicorn or the Fire Guard?

603
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
 Who knows?

604
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
 The prisoner was mean.

605
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
 He tried to catch me.

606
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
 Putri Angsa.

607
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
 Calm down.

608
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
 Bargi is a good person.

609
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,480
 Bargi is just a friend of yours.

610
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,480
 You are so beautiful.

611
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
 So, calm down.

612
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
 We'll tell Bargi.

613
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
 Just tell Bargi.

614
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,480
 I hate men.

615
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
 Especially, Panji.

616
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,480
 We'll tell him.

617
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,480
 What if I'm safe here?

618
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,480
 I know.

619
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
 Alarang Fang.

620
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
 Vega, Prita, and Rafa.

621
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,480
 What's this?

622
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,480
 It's an alarm to keep you safe.

623
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,480
 So, only me, Prita, and Alva can get in.

624
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,480
 Besides, this alarm will make a loud noise.

625
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
 Yes.

626
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,480
 If we get caught, we'll tell them.

627
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,480
 We'll go out now.

628
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
 Okay.

629
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
 Bye.

630
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
 "The Alarm"

631
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:39,480
 I can feel it.

632
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,480
 Help!

633
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,480
 Let me go!

634
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,480
 It's dangerous.

635
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
 Vega and Prita.

636
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,480
 If they set an alarm, they'll be caught.

637
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
 Yes.

638
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
 The alarm.

639
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:08,480
 The water is loud but not deep.

640
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
 I can feel someone is hitting me.

641
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,480
 That's Alarang.

642
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
 That's bad.

643
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
 Rih!

644
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
 Rih, wake up!

645
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
 Wake up!

646
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
 The alarm is loud.

647
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
 Rih!

648
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,480
 Rih!

649
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
 I'm still sleepy.

650
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
 I can't sleep.

651
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
 There's one.

652
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
 What?

653
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
 It's dangerous.

654
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
 Let's go there.

655
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,480
 Help!

656
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:06,480
 Everyone, hurry up.

657
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
 We have to find Putri Angsa.

658
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,480
 Let me go!

659
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
 Let me go!

660
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
 Sir, that's Bargi.

661
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
 He's taking Putri Angsa.

662
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
 Be careful, Bargi.

663
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
 If you touch her, you'll get hurt.

664
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
 Everyone, get ready.

665
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,480
 Sir, what should we do?

666
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
 Hurry up.

667
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,480
 Everyone, get ready.

668
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
 One, two, three.

669
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
 Let me go!

670
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,480
 Let me go!

671
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,480
 Vega! Alpha!

672
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
 Help me!

673
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,480
 I'll be a princess soon.

674
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
 If I become a princess again,

675
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,480
 Panji will be happy.

676
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,480
 Bargi!

677
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
 Bargi!

678
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
 Let Putri Angsa go!

679
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
 Husband?

680
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,480
 Bargi!

681
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
 I'm begging you.

682
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
 Let her go. She's not at fault.

683
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,480
 I don't want to.

684
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,480
 What are you going to do with her?

685
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
 Where are you taking her?

686
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,480
 To the Dark Palace.

687
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
 Bargi!

688
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
 Don't do that!

689
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
 Bargi!

690
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
 Putri Angsa is in need of magic.

691
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
 Don't hurt her.

692
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
 Bargi is more important.

693
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,480
 She's more important.

694
00:37:51,480 --> 00:38:03,480
 Bargi!

695
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,480
 Don't take Putri Angsa, Bargi!

 bargy!

955
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860

956
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,860
 here!

957
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,860
 here!

958
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:58,860
 don't hurt me!

959
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,860
 you're so weak!

960
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,860
 unicorn, attack them!

961
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,860
 *growling*

962
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,860
 congratulations!

963
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,860
 now, i have to bring the princess to the 8th department!

964
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:19,860
 bye!

965
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,860
 unicorn!

966
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,860
 face them, bargy!

967
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,860
 *growling*

968
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:54,860
 bargy!

969
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,860
 *growling*

970
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:21,860
 princess!

971
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,860
 now, you're in the cage!

972
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,860
 Angarang, give the princess to them!

973
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,860
 yes, sir!

974
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:43,860
 here, sir!

975
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,860
 plant it!

976
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,860
 yes, sir!

977
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,860
 plant it!

978
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,860
 you'll be sucked by the unicorn!

979
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:12,860
 we can't do this anymore!

980
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,860
 let's just drop it!

981
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

982
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:29,860
 enough!

983
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

984
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

985
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

986
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

987
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

988
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

989
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

990
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

991
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

992
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

993
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

994
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

995
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

996
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

997
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

998
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

999
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

1000
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

1001
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,860
 we've done the task

1002
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:15,860
 here, sir!

1003
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:24,860
 why is it only a flower?

1004
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,860
 wait until the sun is shining

1005
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,860
 because the sun flower will bloom when the sun is shining

1006
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,860
 it's still a thousand o'clock

1007
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,860
 so...

1008
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,860
 there's still one hour left

1009
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,860
 let's go!

1010
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,860
 wait! wait!

1011
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:46,860
 I thought...

1012
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,860
 it can bloom right away

1013
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,860
 but it has to wait for one hour

1014
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:54,860
 okay

1015
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,860
 I'll wait for you

1016
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,860
 it's here! let's go!

1017
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:10,860
 unicorn!

1018
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,860
 you're evil!

1019
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,860
 you're cheating! you're a traitor!

1020
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,860
 what's that?

1021
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,860
 what's going on?

1022
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,860
 what's going on?

1023
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,860
 help!

1024
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:39,860
 sir!

1025
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

1026
00:55:42,860 --> 00:56:00,860
 I can't do it anymore!

1027
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:06,860
 get up!

1028
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

1029
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:28,860
 mom!

1030
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,860
 *the unicorn is attacking the princess*

1031
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:38,860
 what's wrong?

1032
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,860
 I forgot

1033
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:45,860
 the unicorn is so strong

1034
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:55,860
 Akara!

1035
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,860
 what's that?

1036
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,860
 there's a fight with Panji

1037
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,860
 but don't worry

1038
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,860
 the unicorn will take care of them

1039
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:11,860
 let's grow fast!

1040
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:26,860
 soon

1041
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,860
 you'll be immortal

1042
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,860
 attack that face!

1043
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,860
 you're too late!

1044
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,860
 *we can do it*

1045
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:51,860
 *we can do it*

1046
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,860
 I'm sure there's something wrong with that face

1047
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,860
 including that unicorn

1048
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,860
 I'll look for it

1049
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,860
 *we can do it*

1050
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:42,860
 here it is!

1051
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,860
 so that the weak unicorn

1052
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,860
 can see the crying unicorn

1053
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:58,860
 what's wrong?

1054
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,860
 a bomb!

1055
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,860
 *we can do it*

1056
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:18,860
 why is it crying?

1057
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,860
 the unicorn is not attacking

1058
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,860
 let's go!

1059
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,860
 you have to save everyone

1060
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,860
 *we can do it*

1061
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,860
 *we can do it*

1062
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,860
 *we can do it*

1063
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,860
 *we can do it*

1064
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:51,860
 *we can do it*

1065
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,860
 we did it!

1066
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,860
 we're the

1067
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,860
 Zing! Zing! Zing!

1068
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,860
 Zing! Zing! Zing!

1069
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:26,860
 let's grow fast!

1070
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,860
 attack that face!

1071
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:35,860
 you're too late!

1072
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,860
 only 10 seconds left

1073
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,860
 the baby will be born

1074
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,860
 and you

1075
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,860
 will never be able to destroy my soul, Alva

1076
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:49,860
 feel this, Alva

1077
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,860
 *we can do it*

1078
01:00:51,860 --> 01:01:10,860
 7

1079
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,860
 6

1080
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,860
 this is a very special time, Alva

1081
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,860
 if you turn your finger

1082
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,860
 you can advance the time

1083
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,860
 as much as you turn

1084
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,860
 if you turn your finger back

1085
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,860
 you can turn back the time

1086
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,860
 if you turn off the time

1087
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,860
 you can stop the time

1088
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,860
 *we can do it*

1089
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:45,860
 stop!

1090
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:52,860
 you have 60 seconds

1091
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,860
 to turn back the time

1092
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,860
 I need to find a way to save him

1093
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:05,860
 open the door!

1094
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,860
 *we can do it*

1095
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:20,860
 don't tell me that the first one is in this box

1096
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,860
 let me open it

1097
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:29,860
 I can't

1098
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,860
 I'll open the box!

1099
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,860
 *we can do it*

1100
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,860
 I can't open it

1101
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,860
 I'll open it!

1102
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:47,860
 I can't open it

1103
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,860
 *we can do it*

1104
01:02:49,860 --> 01:03:05,860
 Alva!

1105
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:11,860
 ready!

1106
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,860
 yes, we did it!

1107
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,860
 the time is up

1108
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,860
 it's time to turn back the time

1109
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:26,860
 the sword is still here

1110
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,860
 Alvintar!

1111
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:35,860
 Alva!

1112
