1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, don't ever stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, be brave with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I need your help

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're looking for Edward, right?

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because I'm sure he can help you defeat the Dark Lord

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, I'm looking for him

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And you know why the Dark Lord can't kill you when you're still a baby?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because you're Alfa's chosen child

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No!

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes! I got the book!

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Finally we got this famous "Escape" sword

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Get down, get down!

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Before I find a way to break this sword

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will plant the sun flower

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How's it going, guys? Have you found anything?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We've been looking for everywhere and found nothing, Prof

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, Prof, our eyes were even blinded

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But it's the same, there's no black smoke, Prof

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes, Prof, we've been looking everywhere but there's nothing

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's weird, why is there nothing?

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What's possible? Yasmin is wrong

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Professor Aldebaran

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Agni, what's waiting for me?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The sword, the sword is gone, Prof

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My sword? How can it be gone?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know, Prof

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The professor's room is also messy

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's like someone just came in from here

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's weird

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Agni, where's Yasmin? I want to talk to her

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yasmin is in her room, Prof

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She was injured because she was attacked by a unicorn in the forest

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Agni, Yasmin is not the same person who was in the forest

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right, Prof

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But she was in my room

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's impossible, Prof, that's impossible

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yasmin was with us, we were in the forest looking for the angel fruit

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's weird, that means the one who met me was not Yasmin

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Someone is playing with me

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:21,120
(music intensifies)

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
GO IN.

51
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:33,480
(music intensifies)

52
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Why haven't you waited for me?

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,480
(music intensifies)

54
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
GO IN.

55
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
(music intensifies)

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
(grunt)

57
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,480
(music intensifies)

58
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Come on girls, let's find the flower seeds of that day.

59
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Come on.

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:07,480
(music intensifies)

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
The seeds are not growing.

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
What should we do?

63
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Girls, calm down.

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,480
The seeds won't grow unless we plant them ourselves.

65
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Wow, this must be the work of that unicorn.

66
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
We have to lure him here.

67
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Yes, even if he comes here,

68
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
can we beat him?

69
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,480
(music intensifies)

70
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
You guys just passed out

71
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,480
because you were attacked by a unicorn.

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Right?

73
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Now all of you say thank you to Alfa

74
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,480
because he has helped and fought for his soul and body.

75
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
He brought Fruit Angel here.

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
(grunt)

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Alfa!

78
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
We have to find Alfa.

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,480
(music intensifies)

80
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
How is it?

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Any news?

82
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
The girls and the students have recovered, Professor.

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,480
But we have a new problem.

84
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
What is it?

85
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
You said just the name of the flower that was lost.

86
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
There's more, Professor.

87
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
(music intensifies)

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Ankara has managed to escape from the prison of the devil.

89
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:30,480
(music intensifies)

90
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Hi, Ketri and Samsa.

91
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Hello, Vega.

92
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,480
(music intensifies)

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,480
There she is, Alfa.

94
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Wow, she's also with Ketri.

95
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Samsa!

96
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Samsa, why are you here?

97
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
You said you don't like men.

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Yeah, right.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Then, don't fight with men.

100
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,480
So we can't hide.

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,480
I do hate men.

102
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
But I need Alfa.

103
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,480
(music intensifies)

104
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
What's the matter?

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Alfa, I heard you can beat the unicorn.

106
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,480
So I came here to ask for your help to catch the unicorn.

107
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,480
To take the key to our sun.

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Sorry, Garis Putriangsa.

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,480
We're not here to help you.

110
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
We have other problems.

111
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
We're looking for the unicorn.

112
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
That's right.

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
We still have a lot of...

114
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
...missions.

115
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Go away!

116
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,480
(music intensifies)

117
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,480
If you want to help us...

118
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
...to get the key to our sun...

119
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,480
...we'll help you to get the unicorn.

120
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
What do you want to get?

121
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:17,480
(music intensifies)

122
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
So...

123
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,480
...the sunflower seeds can only be found by the big guys.

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,480
(music intensifies)

125
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I have to find them all.

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:38,480
(music intensifies)

127
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,480
There's another one!

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Help!

129
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:51,480
(music intensifies)

130
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,480
(whistles)

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,480
(music intensifies)

132
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
The unicorn!

133
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,480
(music intensifies)

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
(screams)

135
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Help!

136
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
(screams)

137
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,480
(music intensifies)

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,480
(screams)

139
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Let go of me!

140
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Let go!

141
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
You're so mean!

142
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
(music intensifies)

143
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Okay, we'll help you.

144
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,480
(music intensifies)

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Okay, let's go.

146
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
I want to come with you.

147
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Me too.

148
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
You can't come with us.

149
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Only Alfa, Vega, and this little girl can come with us.

150
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Go!

151
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,480
(whines)

152
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:14,480
(music intensifies)

153
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Okay, let's go.

154
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
I want to come with you!

155
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I can't wait.

156
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
I want to come with you.

157
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:33,480
(music intensifies)

158
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
(laughs)

159
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Mr. Pancik, I'm hungry.

160
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
What?

161
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Mr. Pancik?

162
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
What's that?

163
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
My name is...

164
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Professor Silita's daughter.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
She looks just like you.

166
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Pretty Silita.

167
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Pretty girl.

168
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Who are you? I forgot.

169
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,480
(music intensifies)

170
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Pretty girl.

171
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Can I come with you?

172
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Can I?

173
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Okay.

174
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,480
(music intensifies)

175
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
(laughs)

176
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
You're funny.

177
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
You're funny, honey.

178
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
(laughs)

179
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:33,480
(music intensifies)

180
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Why is it so quiet here?

181
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Yeah, it's so messy.

182
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Maybe...

183
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
(music intensifies)

184
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
(coughs)

185
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
I'm a stone.

186
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Yeah, maybe I was attacked.

187
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,480
(music intensifies)

188
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Wow, this must be a unicorn.

189
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,480
It must be here to talk to us.

190
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,480

You evil.

198
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480

Girls, what do you say?

208
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,480
No way!

209
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
(laughs)

210
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Okay.

211
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480

It was a unicorn yesterday.

218
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
If you don't want to...

219
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
you will be teased by our unicorn.

220
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Go.

221
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
What do you say, girls?

222
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Let's just plant it.

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
OK. We'll do it.

224
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Good.

225
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:46,480

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Why hasn't it grown yet?

229
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Answer me!

230
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,480
It's useless to catch us.

231
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
We're not enough.

232
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
This seedling won't grow.

233
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,480
This seedling will grow if we have more.

234
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,480
While, there's no such thing as a pure seedling.

235
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Right, girls?

236
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480

I'll tear you apart.

240
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,480

Alfa, you're great!

250
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Is that a new trick?

251
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Yes.

252
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
You can run like a horse.

253
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
You're great, Alfa.

254
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:52,480
The horse can't get up.

255
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
The horse is losing.

256
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Everyone, we have to get out of here.

257
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
We have to save the horse first.

258
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Heron!

259
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,480

We're eating.

261
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
How do you know?

262
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
We're eating.

263

Shut up!

264
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
I made the rules here.

265
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
So, I can take you anytime.

266
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,480
I have a mission for you.

267
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Alfa and her friends have kidnapped Ansa...

268
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
and brought her to Sihin School.

269
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
So, your mission now is...

270
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,480
to find Ansa and bring her here.

271
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Don't fail.

272

Do you understand?

273
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Yes, sir.

274
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
You should ask him.

275
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
You should.

276
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Why?

277
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
You're the boss.

278
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
I'm not.

279
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I don't want to.

280
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
You're dreaming.

281
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Don't be noisy!

282
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
What's wrong?

283
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Well...

284
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Well, Heron.

285
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,480

286
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,480

I mean, we'll be free.

288
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
I mean, Heron.

289
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Her hand...

290
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Her tattoo will be gone.

291
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Yes, Heron.

292
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
It's painful.

293
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
If you call us, it's always painful.

294
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Yes, Heron.

295
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
The pain is here.

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Yes.

It's here, Heron.

298
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Alright.

299
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,480
But, after the mission,

300
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
do you understand?

301
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Yes, sir.

302
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,480

I'm a fan.

326
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Don't attack him.

327
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
It's painful.

328
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
No.

329
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Sorry.

330
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480

333
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,480
There's a big female monster outside.

334
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Very big.

335
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Ouch.

336
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Ray.

337
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,480
A female monster.

338
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Don't be afraid.

339
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Let's go.

340
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480

You're smiling.

Where's that big creature from, Professor?

344
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Maybe...

345
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
the monster is the dark wizard.

346
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
I'll attack him.

347

Be careful, Prof.

Divinju!

354
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Professor, the monster is very strong.

355
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
You'd better ask for help.

356
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
It's dangerous.

357
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Come here, Prof.

358
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Okay, Prof.

359
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Attack him again.

Why did you attack my friend?

373
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I don't know.

374
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Why did you attack another friend?

375
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
That's my girlfriend.

376
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
What?

377
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Girlfriend?

378
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
What's wrong with her?

379
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Where's my husband?

380
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Buy the ribbon.

381
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Buy the jiruji.

382
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
They're right.

383
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
The monster is my girlfriend.

384
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Girlfriend?

385
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Bargi?

386
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Husband?

387
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Who's that?

388
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
This is...

389
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Angsa's daughter.

390
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Who?

391
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
This is Angsa's daughter who's injured.

392
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Yes.

393
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
We just saved her.

394
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
She's not my girlfriend.

395
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Calm down, Bargi.

396
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
What are you doing here?

397
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
I told you to stay home.

398
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Let's go to the clinic.

399
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Okay.

400
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Husband!

401
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Wait!

402
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,480
So, the seeds of the sun...

403
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
can only be planted by Angsa's daughters.

404
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Hold this.

405
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Professor.

406
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,480
The kids want to talk to you.

407
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
What's wrong?

408
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,480
So, this is it.

409
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,480
The unicorn is the monster of the eighth prince.

410
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
First,

411
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,480
it took the flowers.

412
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
And then,

413
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
it kidnapped Angsa.

414
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Oh my God.

415
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
They kidnapped everyone?

416
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Yes, Professor.

417
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Only Angsa's daughter managed to save us.

418
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
From now on,

419
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,480
the eighth prince will not be left alone.

420
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,480
In my opinion,

421
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,480
he knows that the soul stone is in the sun flower.

422
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
And the seeds of the sun flower can only be planted by Angsa's daughters.

423
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,480
The sun flower is a very strong flower.

424
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Once it's planted,

425
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
it will never wither.

426
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
And it will never die.

427
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Even if it's destroyed.

428
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,480
That's why,

429
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
the eighth prince...

430
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
wants the seeds of the sun flower...

431
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
to grow into a sun flower.

432
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
So, the unicorn's stone in the sun flower...

433
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
will never be destroyed.

434
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
That means,

435
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
we have to protect Angsa's daughter.

436
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,480
And we can't be kidnapped by the eighth prince.

437
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Yes, Alfa.

438
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
We protect each other.

439
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Are you ready?

440
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm ready, Professor.

441
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,480
And one more thing.

442
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,480
You, Alfa, Vega, and Purita.

443
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Now you have to continue your studies.

444
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Even though you've helped a lot in finding the soul stone,

445
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
but you have to remember,

446
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
education is number one.

447
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
That's right.

448
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Yes, Professor.

449
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Where am I?

450
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:41,480
There's a man!

451
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
This is for you.

452
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Of course.

453
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Thank you.

454
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
The flower is beautiful.

455
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,480
The chocolate.

456
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:11,480
The chocolate makes me want to swim.

457
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I really like this chocolate.

458
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,480
If you want to join us again,

459
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,480
there are so many places outside the classroom.

460
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Really?

461
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Yes.

462
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Let's go.

463
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,480
Come on.

464
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:41,480
My husband's hair.

465
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Why is it so far?

466
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
We're almost there.

467
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
There are a lot of flowers and chocolates for you.

468
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
You must be bored.

469
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Okay, be patient.

470
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Okay, let's go.

471
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Wow, there are so many.

472
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
You're so kind.

473
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Thank you.

474
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
(The flower is beautiful.)

475
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:24,480
(The chocolate makes me want to swim.)

476
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
You're as bad as ever.

477
00:28:52,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Don't run.

478
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
I'll get mad.

479
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Class!

480
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Help!

481
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Don't run!

482
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Help!

483
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Oh, no.

484
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
You made me panic.

485
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
It's not Mr. M58.

486
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
It's Bargi.

487
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Bargi.

488
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I'm mad at you.

489
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm so mad.

490
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Why did you scare Putri Angsa?

491
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
You hate her?

492
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Bad girl.

493
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
No, Bargi.

494
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
She's beautiful.

495
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Bad.

496
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Beautiful.

497
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Bad.

498
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Ouch.

499
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I...

500
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
I'm mad.

501
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Hi, Bargi.

502
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
I'm Angkara.

503
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
I don't know you.

504
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
You may not know me, Bargi.

505
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,480
But you must know the 8th Prince.

506
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Listen, Bargi.

507
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,480
The 8th Prince wants to make a promise with you.

508
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
What promise?

509
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,480
He will take away the curse on you.

510
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
And you will be a beautiful princess again.

511
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Bargi.

512
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
A beautiful princess?

513
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
But there's a condition, Bargi.

514
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
What's the condition?

515
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,480
You must catch and hand over Putri Angsa to the 8th Prince.

516
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
What do you think, Bargi?

517
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Do you agree?

518
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Liar.

519
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
I don't believe you.

520
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,480
You must hand over the 8th Prince to the 8th Prince.

521
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,480
And he can do whatever he wants.

522
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,480
And remember, Bargi.

523
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,480
If you become a beautiful princess again...

524
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,480
...I will automatically choose you from Putri Angsa.

525
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Forgive me, Bargi.

526
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Forgive me for having betrayed you.

527
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Now...

528
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Will you marry me?

529
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Bargi is happy.

530
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,480
What?

531
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Answer me, Bargi.

532
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Don't just smile.

533
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm ready, Bargi.

534
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm ready.

535
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,480
Hazil!

536
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Uncle, it's Bargi!

537
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Watch out, Bargi.

538
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,480
If you touch Putri Angsa's wound...

539
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:40,480
...we can...

540
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,480
It's already late.

541
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
You should sleep.

542
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
I want to rest.

543
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
No.

544
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
I want to leave this place.

545
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
This place is not safe.

546
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Don't go.

547
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
It's more dangerous.

548
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Putri Angsa.

549
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,480
What if you get caught by the Unicorn or the Fire Guard?

550
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Who knows?

551
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
The prisoner was mean.

552
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
He tried to catch me.

553
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Putri Angsa.

554
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Calm down.

555
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Bargi is a good person.

556
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Bargi is just a friend of yours.

557
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,480
You are so beautiful.

558
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
So, calm down.

559
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
We'll tell Bargi.

560
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Just tell Bargi.

561
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I hate men.

562
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Especially, Panji.

563
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,480
We'll tell him.

564
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,480
What if I'm safe here?

565
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I know.

566
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Alarang Fang.

567
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Vega, Prita, and Rafa.

568
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,480
What's this?

569
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,480
It's an alarm to keep you safe.

570
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,480
So, only me, Prita, and Alfa can get in.

571
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Besides, this alarm will make a loud noise.

572
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Yes.

573
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,480
If we get caught, we'll tell them.

574
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,480
We'll go out now.

575
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Okay.

576
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Bye.

577
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
"The Alarm"

578
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:39,480
I can feel it.

579
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Help!

580
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Let me go!

581
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,480
It's dangerous.

582
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Vega and Prita.

583
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,480
If they set an alarm, they'll be caught.

584
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Yes.

585
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
The alarm.

586
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:08,480
The water is loud but not deep.

587
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
I can feel someone is hitting me.

588
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,480
That's Alarang.

589
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
That's bad.

590
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Rih!

591
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
Rih, wake up!

592
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Wake up!

593
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
The alarm is loud.

594
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Rih!

595
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I'm still sleepy.

596
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I can't sleep.

597
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
There's one.

598
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
What?

599
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
It's dangerous.

600
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Let's go there.

601
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Help!

602
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Everyone, hurry up.

603
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
We have to find Putri Angsa.

604
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Let me go!

605
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Sir, that's Bargi.

606
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
He's taking Putri Angsa.

607
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Be careful, Bargi.

608
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
If you touch her, you'll get hurt.

609
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Everyone, get ready.

610
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Sir, what should we do?

611
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Hurry up.

612
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Everyone, get ready.

613
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
One, two, three.

614
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Let me go!

615
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,480
Vega! Alpha!

616
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Help me!

617
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,480
I'll be a princess soon.

618
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
If I become a princess again,

619
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Panji will be happy.

620
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Bargi!

621
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Let Putri Angsa go!

622
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Husband?

623
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Bargi!

624
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
I'm begging you.

625
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Let her go. She's not at fault.

626
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,480
I don't want to.

627
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,480
What are you going to do with her?

628
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Where are you taking her?

629
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,480
To the Dark Palace.

630
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Bargi!

631
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Don't do that!

632
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Bargi!

633
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Putri Angsa is in need of magic.

634
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Don't hurt her.

635
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Bargi is more important.

636
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,480
She's more important.

637
00:37:51,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Bargi!

638
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Don't take Putri Angsa, Bargi!

807
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,760

811
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:54,640
bargy is nice, bargy is honest!

812
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,620

813
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,140

00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,660
bargy is still nice, bargy is nice!

815
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,660
that's enough bargy!

816
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,860
i want you to release my princess right now!

817
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,860
but...

818
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
bargy is already...

819
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
already what?

820
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:22,860
you already gave my princess to the dark side, right?

821
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,860
bargy, you are evil!

822
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,860
you are naughty, you don't know yourself!

823
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,860
but...

00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,860

00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,860
i don't want to deal with you anymore, bargy!

828
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,860

829
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:51,860
bargy is nice, bargy is honest, but i hate bargy!

830
00:45:51,860 --> 00:46:00,860
*sobbing*

831
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,860
bargy is sad!

832
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:08,860
bargy is nice!

833
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:18,860

834
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,860
*sobbing*

835
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,860
bargy, are you serious?

836
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,860
bargy, i don't want to be selfish!

837
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,860
i want to be nice!

838
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,860
wait a minute, bargy!

839
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,860
if you release the princess, where is the princess?

840
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,860
i don't see her!

841
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,860
i don't know!

842
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,860

843
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:53,860

853
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,860
bargy must not be with us!

854
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,860

855
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:03,860

856
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,860

*screaming*

863
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:48,860
thank you, bargy!

864
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,860
*growling*

865
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,860
let's use the rocket launcher!

866
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,860
the princess will be angry if we let her go!

867
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,860
ready!

868
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:09,860

869
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:24,860
we can do it!

870
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,860
you're so weak!

871
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,860
how dare you throw me into the fire!

872
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,860

873
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,860

874
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:52,860

886
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,860
unicorn, attack them!

887
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,860
*growling*

888
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,860

890
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:19,860
bye!

891
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,860
unicorn!

892
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,860
face them, bargy!

893
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,860
*growling*

894
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:54,860
bargy!

895
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,860
*growling*

896
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:21,860
princess!

897
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,860
now, you're in the cage!

898
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,860
Angarang, give the princess to them!

899
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,860
yes, sir!

900
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:43,860
here, sir!

901
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,860
plant it!

902
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,860
yes, sir!

903
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,860
plant it!

904
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,860
you'll be sucked by the unicorn!

905
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:12,860
we can't do this anymore!

906
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,860
let's just drop it!

907
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,860
*the unicorn is attacking the princess*

908
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:29,860
enough!

909
00:53:29,860 --> 00:54:06,860
*the unicorn is attacking the princess*

910
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,860
we've done the task

911
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:15,860
here, sir!

912
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:24,860
why is it only a flower?

913
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,860
wait until the sun is shining

914
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,860
because the sun flower will bloom when the sun is shining

915
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,860
it's still a thousand o'clock

916
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,860
so...

917
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,860
there's still one hour left

918
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,860
let's go!

919
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,860
wait! wait!

920
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:46,860
I thought...

921
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,860
it can bloom right away

922
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,860
but it has to wait for one hour

923
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:54,860
okay

924
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,860
I'll wait for you

925
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,860
it's here! let's go!

926
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:10,860
unicorn!

927
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,860
you're evil!

928
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,860
you're cheating! you're a traitor!

929
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,860
what's that?

930
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:23,860
what's going on?

931
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,860
help!

932
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:39,860
sir!

933
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,860
*the unicorn is attacking the princess*

934
00:55:42,860 --> 00:56:00,860
I can't do it anymore!

935
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:06,860
get up!

936
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,860
*the unicorn is attacking the princess*

937
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:28,860
mom!

938
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,860
*the unicorn is attacking the princess*

939
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:38,860
what's wrong?

940
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,860
I forgot

941
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:45,860
the unicorn is so strong

942
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:55,860
Akara!

943
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,860
what's that?

944
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,860
there's a fight with Panji

945
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,860
but don't worry

946
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,860
the unicorn will take care of them

947
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:11,860
let's grow fast!

948
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:26,860
soon

949
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,860
you'll be immortal

950
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,860
attack that face!

951
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,860
you're too late!

952
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:51,860
*we can do it*

953
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,860
I'm sure there's something wrong with that face

954
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,860
including that unicorn

955
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,860
I'll look for it

956
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,860
*we can do it*

957
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:42,860
here it is!

958
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,860
so that the weak unicorn

959
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,860
can see the crying unicorn

960
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:58,860
what's wrong?

961
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,860
a bomb!

962
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,860
*we can do it*

963
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:18,860
why is it crying?

964
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,860
the unicorn is not attacking

965
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,860
let's go!

966
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,860
you have to save everyone

967
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:51,860
*we can do it*

968
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,860
we did it!

969
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,860
we're the

970
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,860
Zing! Zing! Zing!

971
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:26,860
let's grow fast!

972
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,860
attack that face!

973
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:35,860
you're too late!

974
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,860
only 10 seconds left

975
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,860
the baby will be born

976
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,860
and you

977
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,860
will never be able to destroy my soul, Alfa

978
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:49,860
feel this, Alfa

979
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,860
*we can do it*

980
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,860
this is a very special time, Alfa

981
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,860
if you turn your finger

982
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,860
you can advance the time

983
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,860
as much as you turn

984
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,860
if you turn your finger back

985
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,860
you can turn back the time

986
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,860
if you turn off the time

987
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,860
you can stop the time

988
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,860
*we can do it*

989
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:45,860
stop!

990
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:52,860
you have 60 seconds

991
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,860
to turn back the time

992
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,860
I need to find a way to save him

993
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:05,860
open the door!

994
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,860
*we can do it*

995
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:20,860
don't tell me that the first one is in this box

996
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,860
let me open it

997
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:29,860
I can't

998
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,860
I'll open the box!

999
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,860
*we can do it*

1000
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,860
I can't open it

1001
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,860
I'll open it!

1002
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:47,860
I can't open it

1003
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,860
*we can do it*

1004
01:02:49,860 --> 01:03:05,860
Alfa!

1005
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:11,860
ready!

1006
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,860
yes, we did it!

1007
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,860
the time is up

1008
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,860
it's time to turn back the time

1009
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:26,860
the sword is still here

1010
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,860
Alvintar!

1011
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:35,860
Alfa!

1012
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:41,860
Alfara!

1013
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:59,860
Alfa!

1014
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:41,860
*we can do it*

1015
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:51,860
