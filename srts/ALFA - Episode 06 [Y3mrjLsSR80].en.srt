To be continued...

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Show your spirit, get your friends ready

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Chase your hopes and dreams

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Stop, stop

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sure the dwarfs are still at war

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It seems there is a greater power controlling them

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Terror will continue to spread until I get that chosen one

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you see where the dwarfs are?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They are under the lake, everyone wants to attack the lake

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why aren't they showing up?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Be patient, we'll wait a little longer

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They will definitely show up to attack him

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be patient, everyone

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Watch out!

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They are very agile

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's hide first, we'll attack once they show up

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Agreed

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Attack!

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now answer my question, where did you hide the dwarfs?

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't play around, answer my question

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Answer my question

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you think you can play?

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will show you

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Attack!

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't hurt them, they are innocent

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Dwarf!

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Dwarf, are you okay?

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you for saving me with your tears

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I promise I will free you from your friends

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Vega, attack

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hurry

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We are here to save our friends

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Good, if so, attack

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
These dwarfs deserve to be taught

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We can't hurt the dwarfs, we have to work with them

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You don't know how to teach me

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Professor Purwa, it's not our fault, we should try first

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We don't have much time

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are lying, you have to endure it

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Attack!

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's clear that they are weak

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If so, why do we waste our energy just to fight?

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's why we have to listen to their opinions

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They are still young, but sometimes they are smarter than adults

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Alpha, ask them

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Where are your friends?

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Please tell me where are our friends that you kidnapped?

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What are you doing? Are you playing?

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Calm down, professor

59
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The Dwarf Fairy can't talk

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Lightning!

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It seems like Alpha is right

62
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They are not fake

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But they can't talk because of one thing

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But how can they be so loud?

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why can't you talk?

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who is he?

67
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You were ordered to do this?

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I read your mind

69
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not a fool

70
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Absolutely man?

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,980
There is no way.

72
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,020
With those two little fangs,

73
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,000
you are definitely not a successor to the Black Kite.

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are just a mere agent.

75
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's no other than the Alexander Kvass,

76
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the world's greatest detective.

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, what are you doing here?

78
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It is a mission from all of you.

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
[Music]

80
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Help!

81
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A tiger is coming!

[Music]

83
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, because of that attack,

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you can't talk?

85
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:13,000
[Music]

86
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I am...

87
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the decision of the 8th Prince.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I have stolen your voice.

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And if you want your voice back,

90
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
then...

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you have to kidnap 8 children from a magic school.

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And one of those children...

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
must be a boy named Alfa.

94
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Those children...

95
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
must be taken to the headquarters of the 8th Prince...

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
which is located here.

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The headquarters is a secret.

98
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So...

99
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you can't tell anyone about it.

100
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And if one of you...

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
leak it,

102
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
then...

103
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you will all be cursed to be a bully!

[Music]

105
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The 8th Prince said that you have to kidnap 8 children.

106
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How many?

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
[Music]

108
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So...

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
two more children are missing.

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000

Do you have more?

125
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,620
Why do we teach you kids?

126
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,540
We will be bored, sir.

127
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,620
We don't get bored anymore!

128
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
I am ready, mom.

129
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,380
I am learning the magic of magic.

130
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,860
So I am sure I can protect myself.

131
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,560
But Alfa is not alone.

132
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,400
I will protect her.

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
It is dangerous!

Don't worry, Tentarang.

136
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,600
We have already fought the three-headed dragon.

137
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
So we are sure.

138
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,080
I think there is no other choice.

139
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
I will count to three.

140
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,280
If there is no better idea, we will use Alfa's idea.

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,000
Professor Purwa!

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,720
One.

What should I do? I don't want Alfa to get hurt.

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
They must know about the trap.

172
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
And they deliberately destroyed it.

If it's not a trap, how can we stop them?

174
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,520
This is all because of Professor Purwa.

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Don't.

192
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm hungry.

193
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
What?

194
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,520
We're caught.

195
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520
It hurts.

196
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Where are we?

197
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
We're caught.

198
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Where's our cage?

199
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Oh, right.

200
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Where's my cage?

201
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Maybe, they found it.

202
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,520
If we lose our cage,

203
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
the teachers won't know where we are.

204
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
We'll be in trouble.

205
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
I don't know.

206
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:31,520
We're trapped.

208
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,520
I'll open it.

209
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Quiet.

210
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Remember.

211
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,520
If you dare to do anything,

212
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,520
I'll turn you into fish.

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Rangga, put down your weapon.

215
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Now, you can't turn us into fish.

216
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Guys, let's get out of here.

217
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Wait.

219
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,520
It's not that easy.

221
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Professor Ranggara.

222
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm sorry.

223
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Thank you for still recognizing me.

224
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Professor.

225
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Why are you here?

226
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
You should be in jail.

227
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,520
You underestimated me.

228
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
A prison like that...

229
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,520
is nothing to me.

230
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:58,520
And you, Alfa.

231
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Don't be happy...

232
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
because you took my tongsis.

233
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Because without tongsis,

234
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I can still use my magic.

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
What should I do?

239
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,520
I feel sorry for Alfa and Vega.

240
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
They're my friends.

241
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,520
But if I tell them without them knowing...

242
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I...

243
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Shut up, you all!

244
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Shut up!

00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,520
What's wrong, Professor Ragli?

250
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
It's no use fighting.

251
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,520
It's better if we find the children.

252
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
But what do we do?

253
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
We don't have any other way.

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,520
He told us to follow him.

256
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
He knows where the children are.

257
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Let's go!

258
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Wait!

00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
What if we're trapped?

260
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Do you have a better idea?

261
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,520

What is this place?

264
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
This must be a trap.

265
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,520
He told us to press it.

266
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:39,520
He told you to press the stone.

267
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
You lied to us.

268
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,520
You will get your revenge.

269
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,520
To save your friends, you must be ready.

270
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
I've destroyed the company.

271
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
How do you know?

272
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Let's go.

273
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Let's go in.

274
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Get out of here!

275
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,520
How do we get out?

276
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,520
We have to break the stone.

277
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Let's go.

278
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,520

We're going to be separated.

[To be continued]

286
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:47,520
There are two ways.

287
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Which one should we take?

288
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,520
We should split up.

289
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Wait.

290
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
I think that's smoke.

291
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
It's a message from the children.

292
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Let's just follow the smoke.

293
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,520
So, we don't have to split up.

294
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Let's go.

295
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:14,520
So, Professor Anggara...

296
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,520
ran away from the prison?

297
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Don't you dare.

298
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,520
The dark will not be able to hide.

299
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
The dark will not rise again.

300
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
You have captured me.

301
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,520
The terror will not end here.

In the end,

303
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
you will lose.

The kidnappers...

305
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
must be Anggara.

Don't be afraid.

Anggara.

You managed to escape from the dungeon.

You underestimate my magic power.

You think...

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,520
...I can't escape from a cheap dungeon like that?

Wait.

338
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Isn't this the energy transfer crystal?

339
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,520
This weapon is very dangerous.

340
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,520
This crystal can collect the energy of the people who want it.

341
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
And it can absorb the energy until it's exhausted.

342
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
We don't have much time.

343
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,520
We have to destroy this crystal ball.

344
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,520
If the crystal ball is full, it means the children's energy is absorbed.

345
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
The children can die.

346

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,520
I'm here!

383
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
I'm here, Megantara.

384
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Megantara!

385
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Megantara.

386
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Alpha.

387
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,520
Professor, I'm here.

388
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Thank you, Professor.

389
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Let's go.

390
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,520
This is Centara.

391
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:29,520
It's dangerous. All the roads are closed.

392
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
What should we do, Professor?

393
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Alpha, Professor.

394
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Look, there's a hole.

395
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
It's enough for two people.

396
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Alpha, come on.

397
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Go inside that hole.

398
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Hurry!

399
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Come on, Professor.

400
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
Go inside. Follow Alpha.

401
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
No, Megantara. You go inside.

402
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
You can take care of it later.

403
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Professor, go inside.

404
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Stay in the middle.

405
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Where's Megantara?

406
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
What's wrong?

407
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Don't leave me again!

408
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:42,520
We can do this!

409
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Centara, please.

410
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Centara.

411
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
Don't leave me.

412
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Centara, wake up.

413
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,520
You promised me.

414
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,520
Don't leave me, Centara.

415
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Wake up, Centara.

416
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Centara!

417
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Wake up, Centara!

418
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,520
Centara! Wake up!

419
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Wake up, Centara!

420
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
Centara!

421
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:33,520
Centara, wake up!

422
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,520
Centara, wake up.

423
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Centara.

424
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Alpha, Megantara, hold on.

425
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,520
Centara.

426
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Be careful. Don't push me.

427
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
I'll smash your head.

428
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:31,520
Coconut fruit.

429
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,520
Alpha.

430
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Don't cry.

431
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
Smile.

432
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,520
I promised you...

433
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,520
...that I'll save you all.

434
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,520
Captain Megantara...

435
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,520
...never breaks his promise.

436
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Okay.

437
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,520
Where's your tuxedo?

438
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
(Megantara's tuxedo)

439
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:17,520
It's okay.

440
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,520
Didiung, you can talk now?

441
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Yes.

442
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,520
It's because the magic has gone.

443
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
The place is ruined.

444
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
(Megantara's tuxedo)

445
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:37,520
Thank you, Putih Diung.

446
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,520
I'm so happy that you've saved us.

447
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
My name is Tiara.

448
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm so happy to meet you.

449
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
We'll come back here again.

450
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
Right, Alpha?

451
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
Yes, I'm happy to meet you too.

452
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,520
You're good kids.

453
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,520
I'm thankful that you saved me.

454
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
(Megantara's tuxedo)

455
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Putih Tiara, what's wrong?

456
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
Are you sick?

457
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Putih Tiara!

458
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
Where are you?

459
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,520
This is all because of the Dark Lord's curse.

460
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Putih Tiara has leaked the kids' whereabouts.

461
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,520
And now, she's being possessed by the magic.

462
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Tiara...

463
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
(The Dark Lord's curse)

464
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:57,520
It's more dangerous than the dark lord.

465
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,520
Let's just play.

466
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,520
How about we go to the lake?

467
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,520
I don't want to go to the lake.

468
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,520
I don't want to go to the lake. I'll remember you.

469
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
I don't want to.

470
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:23,520
He left me.

471
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Fine. If you don't want to play, I'll play.

472
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
(The Dark Lord's curse)

473
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:42,520
No, don't.

474
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
It's going to be dark again.

475
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,520
No, don't!

476
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Don't hurt me again.

477
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
Don't be afraid.

478
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
We're not going to harm humans anymore.

479
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
Are you serious?

480
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
Yes.

481
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Why are you alone?

482
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
What else can I do?

483
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,520
Because Alfa and Vega are still sad.

484
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
Because Putih Tiara is possessed.

485
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Don't be like that.

486
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Come here.

487
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
I want to talk to you.

488
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
What?

489
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
(The Dark Lord's curse)

490
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:41,520
I'm going to be Alfa, Vega.

491
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,520
I'm going to be a witch.

492
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Please, don't go.

493
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Please, Putih Tiara. Don't go.

494
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,520
Putih Tiara, I'm sad.

495
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:06,520
Go away.

496
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,520
I'm not fit.

497
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Vega.

498
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
You're so weird.

499
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
I have a new surprise for you.

500
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
I'm Jamon.

501
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
I'm sure you won't be sad.

502
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,520
No, we're going to the orphanage.

503
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
Me too.

504
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
It's true.

505
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
You don't want to meet Putih Tiara.

506
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Don't lie.

507
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,520
It's true. I'm not lying.

508
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
Be careful if you lie.

509
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
But on one condition.

510
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,520
Alfa, you have to be a girl.

511
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,520
It's not funny.

512
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
It's true.

513
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Just follow me.

514
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,520
Is she a girl?

515
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,520
I don't know.

516
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:05,520
I'm not comfortable.

517
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,520
Where is Putih Tiara?

518
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,520
If you're lying, I'll tie you up.

519
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Just wait.

520
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
They'll come.

521
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
What?

522
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,520
They.

523
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,520
Let's go.

524
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Girls.

525
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:51,520
That's Putih Tiara.

526
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Remember what I said?

527
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,520
I met Putih Duyung.

528
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,520
He told me...

529
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,520
...that if you're a girl, you have to take Putih Tiara's mother.

530
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
So, she can live.

531
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,520
And then, she'll be a girl.

532
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
Hurry up.

533
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,520
Wait for me.

534
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,520
They don't like men.

535
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
Hurry up.

536
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:41,520
To be continued...

537
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Putih Tiara.

538
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:55,520
I'm happy to see you again.

539
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Girls.

540
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:37,520
It's so fun.

541
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,520
There's another man.

542
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Where are you going?

543
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,520
Thank you, Rek.

544
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,520
I'm so happy to meet you, Tiara.

545
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,520
Me too.

546
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,520
It's just for a while.

547
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,520
But I'm happy because he's a good boy.

548
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
I know.

549
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,520
But I'm so weak.

550
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Attention, girls.

551
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,520
Starting tomorrow, you'll have a mid-semester vacation.

552
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,520
And you'll do a field trip to a magic village...

553
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
...not far from the school.

554
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,520
Yes!

555
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,520
There, you'll stay at a guest house...

556
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,520
...and have a chat with the magic people.

557
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,520
Professor Agni, Purwa, and Megantara...

558
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
...will accompany you...

559
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
...to watch you...

560
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
...so you don't do anything stupid.

561
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
Do you understand?

562
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
Yes, sir.

563
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
(The Magic Village)

564
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:13,520
There will be a sports competition in the village.

565
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
It will be fun.

566
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
There are a lot of food.

567
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
We'll eat a lot.

568
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,520
It must be fun.

569
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
Yes, I can't wait to go there.

570
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
Yes!

571
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:50,520
We have a result.

572
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
I just heard...

573
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,520
...that the kids from the magic school will host a field trip to the magic village.

574
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
And I think...

575
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,520
...we can attack Alfa there.

576
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,520
I won't fail this time.

577
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,520
So I can regain my strength.

578
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,520
I must get that kid.

579
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
Don't worry, sir.

580
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,520
I'll give you whatever you want.

581
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,520
(The Magic Village)

582
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Alfa!

583
00:55:46,520 --> 00:56:04,520
How did you get in here?

584
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Don't be a spy, Alfa.

585
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Why?

586
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
It's dangerous, Alfa.

587
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,520
Please, don't go.

588
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,520
But why?

589
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,520
You said you wanted to join the field trip.

590
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,520
I said no.

591
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,520
The event must be fun.

592
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,520
Okay.

593
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,520
We'll always be there.

594
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,520
Where is he?

595
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
It was just a dream.

596
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
But...

597
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,520
What does it mean?

598
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,520
Why was I forbidden to join the field trip?

599
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,520
Why?

600
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,520
Those two...

601
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,520
...always appear in my dreams.

602
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
And they give me a headache.

603
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,520
Kids.

604
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
We'll leave soon.

605
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
On the count of three,

606
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,520
we'll say the spell together.

607
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
One.

608
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
Two.

609
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Three.

610
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
Four.

611
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
Five.

612
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:47,520
(The Magic Village)

613
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:57,520
They're here.

614
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,520
Oh, yes.

615
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,520
As we've predicted,

616
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,520
one of them...

617
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
will open the door...

618
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,520
and make chaos in this village.

619
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Nik.

620
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Now, you'll meet the village head, Mr. Galaksi.

621
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,520
Tell him that we're here.

622
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
And then,

623
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,520
you'll come back here.

624
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,520
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Come on, kids.

626
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Let's see.

627
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:54,520
(The Magic Village)

628
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,520
Where did you go?

629
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
It's here.

630
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Nik.

631
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,520
Faiqa.

632
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,520
Where are you?

633
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
We can't be separated.

634
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
We have to be together.

635
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,520
Come on, kids.

636
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Come on, everyone.

637
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,520
Faiqa.

638
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,520
That's the test, Nik.

639
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,520
Yes, it is.

640
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,520
(The Magic Village)

641
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:48,520
Karnik.

642
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Why did Karnik turn into a rock?

643
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
Maybe he's possessed?

644
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Oh, no.

645
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,520
(The Magic Village)

646
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:20,520
It turns out that the prophecy is true.

647
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
The disaster is here.

648
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,520
We will all be possessed by the legendary monster.

649
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,520
Yes, it is.

650
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:35,520
The legendary monster?

651
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,520
What did that man mean?

652
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,520
What is the legendary monster?

653
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:51,520
What really happened here?

654
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
I don't know.

655
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Don't worry.

656
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,520
Megantara will be back.

657
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,520
Who are you?

658
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,520
I'm a monster.

659
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:14,520
I'm a powerful monster.

660
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,520
What's going on, Nik and Karnik?

661
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,520
Why are you here?

662
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,520
I have a clue about what happened here.

663
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
