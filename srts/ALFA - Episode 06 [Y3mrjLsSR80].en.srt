1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Show your spirit, get your friends ready

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Chase your hopes and dreams

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Stop, stop

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sure the dwarfs are still at war

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It seems there is a greater power controlling them

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Terror will continue to spread until I get that chosen one

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you see where the dwarfs are?

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They are under the lake, everyone wants to attack the lake

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why aren't they showing up?

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Be patient, we'll wait a little longer

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They will definitely show up to attack him

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be patient, everyone

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Watch out!

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They are very agile

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's hide first, we'll attack once they show up

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Agreed

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Attack!

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now answer my question, where did you hide the dwarfs?

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't play around, answer my question

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Answer my question

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you think you can play?

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will show you

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Attack!

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't hurt them, they are innocent

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Dwarf!

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Dwarf, are you okay?

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you for saving me with your tears

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I promise I will free you from your friends

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Vega, attack

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hurry

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We are here to save our friends

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Good, if so, attack

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
These dwarfs deserve to be taught

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We can't hurt the dwarfs, we have to work with them

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You don't know how to teach me

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Professor Purwa, it's not our fault, we should try first

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We don't have much time

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are lying, you have to endure it

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Attack!

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's clear that they are weak

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If so, why do we waste our energy just to fight?

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's why we have to listen to their opinions

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They are still young, but sometimes they are smarter than adults

53
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Alpha, ask them

54
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Where are your friends?

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Please tell me where are our friends that you kidnapped?

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What are you doing? Are you playing?

57
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Calm down, professor

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The Dwarf Fairy can't talk

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Lightning!

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It seems like Alpha is right

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They are not fake

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But they can't talk because of one thing

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But how can they be so loud?

64
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why can't you talk?

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who is he?

66
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You were ordered to do this?

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I read your mind

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not a fool

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Absolutely man?

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,980
There is no way.

71
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,020
With those two little fangs,

72
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,000
you are definitely not a successor to the Black Kite.

73
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are just a mere agent.

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's no other than the Alexander Kvass,

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the world's greatest detective.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, what are you doing here?

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It is a mission from all of you.

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Help!

79
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A tiger is coming!

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, because of that attack,

81
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you can't talk?

82
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I am...

83
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the decision of the 8th Prince.

84
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I have stolen your voice.

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And if you want your voice back,

86
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
then...

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you have to kidnap 8 children from a magic school.

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And one of those children...

89
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
must be a boy named Alfa.

90
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Those children...

91
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
must be taken to the headquarters of the 8th Prince...

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
which is located here.

93
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The headquarters is a secret.

94
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So...

95
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you can't tell anyone about it.

96
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And if one of you...

97
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
leak it,

98
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
then...

99
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you will all be cursed to be a bully!

100
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The 8th Prince said that you have to kidnap 8 children.

101
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How many?

102
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So...

103
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
two more children are missing.

104
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And one of them must be me.

105
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Mom!

106
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Dad!

107
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Mom!

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Dad!

109
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Mom!

110
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Karim!

111
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What is it, Ren?

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Food! Food!

113
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Food, Karim!

114
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,860
Haste makes waste.

115
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,140
Do you have more?

116
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,620
Why do we teach you kids?

117
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,540
We will be bored, sir.

118
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,620
We don't get bored anymore!

119
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
I am ready, mom.

120
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,380
I am learning the magic of magic.

121
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,860
So I am sure I can protect myself.

122
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,560
But Alfa is not alone.

123
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,400
I will protect her.

124
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,800
The fruit of the dragon, the fruit of the dragon fruit.

125
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
It is dangerous!

126
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,560
Don't worry, Tentarang.

127
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,600
We have already fought the three-headed dragon.

128
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
So we are sure.

129
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,080
I think there is no other choice.

130
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
I will count to three.

131
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,280
If there is no better idea, we will use Alfa's idea.

132
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,000
Professor Purwa!

133
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,720
One.

134
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,520
Two.

135
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,080
Three.

136
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
We will use Alfa's idea.

137
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,920
Dapatang Koveris!

138
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:42,880
I have installed the protection device and the tracking device on the back.

139
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,800
Alfa, Vega, wait.

140
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Alfa, Vega, you have to be careful.

141
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,800
I promise, I will save you.

142
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,000
Putri Ruyung, let's get through this disaster.

143
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You take us to the eighth dimension.

144
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What should I do? I don't want Alfa to get hurt.

145
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,720
But I can't tell her where it is.

146
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,520
Hurry, Putri Ruyung. We don't have much time.

147
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
We have to save my friend.

148
00:13:44,520 --> 00:14:07,520
[The End]

149
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Good, very good.

150
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Finally, I have succeeded in my dream.

151
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Give them to me.

152
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Karim, wait for me.

153
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm scared, we're all scared.

154
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
And hungry.

155
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Karim, please.

156
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
I know, I heard your voice.

157
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
I was thinking how to get out of here.

158
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
I cried.

159
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,520
I'm so sad.

160
00:15:21,520 --> 00:16:46,520
[To be continued]

161
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,520
What happened?

162
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
They must know about the trap.

163
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
And they deliberately destroyed it.

164
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,520
If it's not a trap, how can we stop them?

165
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,520
This is all because of Professor Purwa.

166
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Because of you, Purwa.

167
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Now, Ava's life is in danger.

168
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Megantara, what do you mean?

169
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
This is not my fault.

170
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
But it's true.

171
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
You threatened me.

172
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,520
I was trying to save the children.

173
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
What?

174
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Megantara!

175
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Enough.

176
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
It's no use.

177
00:17:36,520 --> 00:18:58,520
[To be continued]

178
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Remember.

179
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
No one can dare to escape.

180
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
If you dare to do anything,

181
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
I'll turn you into fish.

182
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Don't.

183
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm hungry.

184
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
What?

185
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,520
We're caught.

186
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520
It hurts.

187
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Where are we?

188
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
We're caught.

189
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Where's our cage?

190
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Oh, right.

191
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Where's my cage?

192
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Maybe, they found it.

193
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,520
If we lose our cage,

194
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
the teachers won't know where we are.

195
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
We'll be in trouble.

196
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
I don't know.

197
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:31,520
We're trapped.

[To be continued]

199
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,520
I'll open it.

200
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Quiet.

201
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Remember.

202
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,520
If you dare to do anything,

203
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,520
I'll turn you into fish.

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Rangga, put down your weapon.

206
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Now, you can't turn us into fish.

207
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Guys, let's get out of here.

208
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Wait.

210
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,520
It's not that easy.

[To be continued]

212
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Professor Ranggara.

213
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm sorry.

214
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Thank you for still recognizing me.

215
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Professor.

216
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Why are you here?

217
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
You should be in jail.

218
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,520
You underestimated me.

219
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
A prison like that...

220
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,520
is nothing to me.

221
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:58,520
And you, Alfa.

222
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Don't be happy...

223
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
because you took my tongsis.

224
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Because without tongsis,

225
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I can still use my magic.

229
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
What should I do?

230
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,520
I feel sorry for Alfa and Vega.

231
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
They're my friends.

232
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,520
But if I tell them without them knowing...

233
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I...

234
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Shut up, you all!

235
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Shut up!

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,520

240
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,520
What's wrong, Professor Ragli?

241
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
It's no use fighting.

242
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,520
It's better if we find the children.

243
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
But what do we do?

244
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
We don't have any other way.

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,520
He told us to follow him.

247
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
He knows where the children are.

248
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Let's go!

249
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Wait!

250
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
What if we're trapped?

251
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Do you have a better idea?

252
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Hurry!

254
00:25:47,520 --> 00:26:13,520
What is this place?

255
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
This must be a trap.

256
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,520
He told us to press it.

257
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:39,520
He told you to press the stone.

258
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
You lied to us.

259
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,520
You will get your revenge.

260
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,520
To save your friends, you must be ready.

261
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
I've destroyed the company.

262
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
How do you know?

263
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Let's go.

264
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Let's go in.

265
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Get out of here!

266
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,520
How do we get out?

267
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,520
We have to break the stone.

268
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Let's go.

269
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,520

We're going to be separated.

[To be continued]

277
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:47,520
There are two ways.

278
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Which one should we take?

279
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,520
We should split up.

280
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Wait.

281
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
I think that's smoke.

282
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
It's a message from the children.

283
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Let's just follow the smoke.

284
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,520
So, we don't have to split up.

285
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Let's go.

286
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:14,520
So, Professor Anggara...

287
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,520
ran away from the prison?

288
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Don't you dare.

289
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,520
The dark will not be able to hide.

290
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
The dark will not rise again.

291
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
You have captured me.

292
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,520
The terror will not end here.

00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,520
In the end,

294
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
you will lose.

295
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,520
The kidnappers...

296
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
must be Anggara.

Don't be afraid.

Anggara.

00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,520
You managed to escape from the dungeon.

00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:05,520
You underestimate my magic power.

You think...

317
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,520
...I can't escape from a cheap dungeon like that?

Where do you want to go, Anggara?

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:52,520
The door is broken.

Let's go.

328
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Wait.

329
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Isn't this the energy transfer crystal?

330
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,520
This weapon is very dangerous.

331
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,520
This crystal can collect the energy of the people who want it.

332
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
And it can absorb the energy until it's exhausted.

333
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
We don't have much time.

334
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,520
We have to destroy this crystal ball.

335
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,520
If the crystal ball is full, it means the children's energy is absorbed.

336
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
The children can die.

337

It seems that the destruction of the crystal ball destroyed this place.

00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,520
This is Centara.

382
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:29,520
It's dangerous. All the roads are closed.

383
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
What should we do, Professor?

384
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Alpha, Professor.

385
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Look, there's a hole.

386
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
It's enough for two people.

387
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Alpha, come on.

388
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Go inside that hole.

389
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Hurry!

390
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Come on, Professor.

391
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
Go inside. Follow Alpha.

392
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
No, Megantara. You go inside.

393
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
You can take care of it later.

394
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Professor, go inside.

395
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Stay in the middle.

396
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Where's Megantara?

397
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
What's wrong?

398
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Don't leave me again!

399
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:42,520
We can do this!

400
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Centara, please.

401
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Centara.

402
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
Don't leave me.

403
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Centara, wake up.

404
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,520
You promised me.

405
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,520
Don't leave me, Centara.

406
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Wake up, Centara.

407
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Centara!

408
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Wake up, Centara!

409
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,520
Centara! Wake up!

410
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Wake up, Centara!

411
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
Centara!

412
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:33,520
Centara, wake up!

413
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,520
Centara, wake up.

414
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Centara.

415
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Alpha, Megantara, hold on.

416
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,520
Centara.

417
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Be careful. Don't push me.

418
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
I'll smash your head.

419
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:31,520
Coconut fruit.

420
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,520
Alpha.

421
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Don't cry.

422
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
Smile.

423
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,520
I promised you...

424
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,520
...that I'll save you all.

425
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,520
Captain Megantara...

426
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,520
...never breaks his promise.

427
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Okay.

428
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,520
Where's your tuxedo?

429
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
(Megantara's tuxedo)

430
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:17,520
It's okay.

431
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,520
Didiung, you can talk now?

432
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Yes.

433
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,520
It's because the magic has gone.

434
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
The place is ruined.

435
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
(Megantara's tuxedo)

436
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:37,520
Thank you, Putih Diung.

437
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,520
I'm so happy that you've saved us.

438
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
My name is Tiara.

439
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm so happy to meet you.

440
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
We'll come back here again.

441
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
Right, Alpha?

442
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
Yes, I'm happy to meet you too.

443
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,520
You're good kids.

444
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,520
I'm thankful that you saved me.

445
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
(Megantara's tuxedo)

446
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Putih Tiara, what's wrong?

447
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
Are you sick?

448
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Putih Tiara!

449
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
Where are you?

450
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,520
This is all because of the Dark Lord's curse.

451
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Putih Tiara has leaked the kids' whereabouts.

452
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,520
And now, she's being possessed by the magic.

453
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Tiara...

454
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
(The Dark Lord's curse)

455
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:57,520
It's more dangerous than the dark lord.

456
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,520
Let's just play.

457
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,520
How about we go to the lake?

458
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,520
I don't want to go to the lake.

459
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,520
I don't want to go to the lake. I'll remember you.

460
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
I don't want to.

461
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:23,520
He left me.

462
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Fine. If you don't want to play, I'll play.

463
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
(The Dark Lord's curse)

464
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:42,520
No, don't.

465
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
It's going to be dark again.

466
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,520
No, don't!

467
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
Don't hurt me again.

468
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
Don't be afraid.

469
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
We're not going to harm humans anymore.

470
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
Are you serious?

471
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
Yes.

472
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Why are you alone?

473
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
What else can I do?

474
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,520
Because Alfa and Vega are still sad.

475
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
Because Putih Tiara is possessed.

476
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Don't be like that.

477
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Come here.

478
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
I want to talk to you.

479
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
What?

480
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
(The Dark Lord's curse)

481
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:41,520
I'm going to be Alfa, Vega.

482
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,520
I'm going to be a witch.

483
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Please, don't go.

484
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Please, Putih Tiara. Don't go.

485
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,520
Putih Tiara, I'm sad.

486
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:06,520
Go away.

487
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,520
I'm not fit.

488
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Vega.

489
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
You're so weird.

490
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
I have a new surprise for you.

491
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
I'm Jamon.

492
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
I'm sure you won't be sad.

493
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,520
No, we're going to the orphanage.

494
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
Me too.

495
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
It's true.

496
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
You don't want to meet Putih Tiara.

497
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Don't lie.

498
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,520
It's true. I'm not lying.

499
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
Be careful if you lie.

500
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
But on one condition.

501
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,520
Alfa, you have to be a girl.

502
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,520
It's not funny.

503
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
It's true.

504
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Just follow me.

505
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,520
Is she a girl?

506
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,520
I don't know.

507
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:05,520
I'm not comfortable.

508
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,520
Where is Putih Tiara?

509
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,520
If you're lying, I'll tie you up.

510
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Just wait.

511
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
They'll come.

512
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
What?

513
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,520
They.

514
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,520
Let's go.

515
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Girls.

516
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:51,520
That's Putih Tiara.

517
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Remember what I said?

518
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,520
I met Putih Duyung.

519
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,520
He told me...

520
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,520
...that if you're a girl, you have to take Putih Tiara's mother.

521
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
So, she can live.

522
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,520
And then, she'll be a girl.

523
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
Hurry up.

524
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,520
Wait for me.

525
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,520
They don't like men.

526
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
Hurry up.

527
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Putih Tiara.

528
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:55,520
I'm happy to see you again.

529
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Girls.

530
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:37,520
It's so fun.

531
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,520
There's another man.

532
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Where are you going?

533
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,520
Thank you, Rek.

534
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,520
I'm so happy to meet you, Tiara.

535
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,520
Me too.

536
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,520
It's just for a while.

537
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,520
But I'm happy because he's a good boy.

538
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
I know.

539
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,520
But I'm so weak.

540
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Attention, girls.

541
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,520
Starting tomorrow, you'll have a mid-semester vacation.

542
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,520
And you'll do a field trip to a magic village...

543
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
...not far from the school.

544
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,520
Yes!

545
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,520
There, you'll stay at a guest house...

546
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,520
...and have a chat with the magic people.

547
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,520
Professor Agni, Purwa, and Megantara...

548
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
...will accompany you...

549
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
...to watch you...

550
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
...so you don't do anything stupid.

551
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
Do you understand?

552
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
Yes, sir.

553
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
(The Magic Village)

554
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:13,520
There will be a sports competition in the village.

555
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
It will be fun.

556
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
There are a lot of food.

557
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
We'll eat a lot.

558
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,520
It must be fun.

559
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
Yes, I can't wait to go there.

560
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
Yes!

561
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:50,520
We have a result.

562
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
I just heard...

563
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,520
...that the kids from the magic school will host a field trip to the magic village.

564
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
And I think...

565
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,520
...we can attack Alfa there.

566
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,520
I won't fail this time.

567
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,520
So I can regain my strength.

568
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,520
I must get that kid.

569
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
Don't worry, sir.

570
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,520
I'll give you whatever you want.

571
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,520
(The Magic Village)

572
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Alfa!

573
00:55:46,520 --> 00:56:04,520
How did you get in here?

574
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Don't be a spy, Alfa.

575
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Why?

576
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
It's dangerous, Alfa.

577
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,520
Please, don't go.

578
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,520
But why?

579
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,520
You said you wanted to join the field trip.

580
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,520
I said no.

581
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,520
The event must be fun.

582
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,520
Okay.

583
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,520
We'll always be there.

584
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,520
Where is he?

585
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
It was just a dream.

586
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
But...

587
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,520
What does it mean?

588
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,520
Why was I forbidden to join the field trip?

589
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,520
Why?

590
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,520
Those two...

591
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,520
...always appear in my dreams.

592
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
And they give me a headache.

593
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,520
Kids.

594
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
We'll leave soon.

595
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
On the count of three,

596
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,520
we'll say the spell together.

597
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
One.

598
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
Two.

599
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Three.

600
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
Four.

601
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
Five.

602
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:47,520
(The Magic Village)

603
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:57,520
They're here.

604
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,520
Oh, yes.

605
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,520
As we've predicted,

606
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,520
one of them...

607
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
will open the door...

608
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,520
and make chaos in this village.

609
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Nik.

610
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Now, you'll meet the village head, Mr. Galaksi.

611
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,520
Tell him that we're here.

612
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
And then,

613
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,520
you'll come back here.

614
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,520
Yes, ma'am.

615
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Come on, kids.

616
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Let's see.

617
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:54,520
(The Magic Village)

618
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,520
Where did you go?

619
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
It's here.

620
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Nik.

621
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,520
Faiqa.

622
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,520
Where are you?

623
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
We can't be separated.

624
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
We have to be together.

625
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,520
Come on, kids.

626
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Come on, everyone.

627
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,520
Faiqa.

628
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,520
That's the test, Nik.

629
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,520
Yes, it is.

630
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,520
(The Magic Village)

631
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:48,520
Karnik.

632
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Why did Karnik turn into a rock?

633
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
Maybe he's possessed?

634
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Oh, no.

635
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,520
(The Magic Village)

636
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:20,520
It turns out that the prophecy is true.

637
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
The disaster is here.

638
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,520
We will all be possessed by the legendary monster.

639
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,520
Yes, it is.

640
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:35,520
The legendary monster?

641
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,520
What did that man mean?

642
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,520
What is the legendary monster?

643
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:51,520
What really happened here?

644
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
I don't know.

645
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Don't worry.

646
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,520
Megantara will be back.

647
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,520
Who are you?

648
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,520
I'm a monster.

649
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:14,520
I'm a powerful monster.

650
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,520
What's going on, Nik and Karnik?

651
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,520
Why are you here?

652
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,520
I have a clue about what happened here.

653
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
