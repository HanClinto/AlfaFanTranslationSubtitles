 Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Be brave, don't give up

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Chase your hopes and dreams

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Stop, stop

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'm sure the dwarfs are still at war

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 It seems there is a greater power controlling them

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Terror will continue to spread until I get that chosen one

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Do you see where the dwarfs are?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 They are under the lake, everyone wants to attack the lake

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Why aren't they showing up?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Be patient, we'll wait a little longer

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 They will definitely show up to attack him

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Be patient, everyone

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Watch out!

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 They are very agile

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Let's hide first, we'll attack once they show up

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Agreed

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Let's go

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Attack!

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Attack!

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Now answer my question, where did you hide the dwarfs?

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Don't play around, answer my question

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Answer my question

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Do you think you can play?

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I will show you

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Attack!

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Attack!

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Don't hurt them, they are innocent

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Dwarf!

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Dwarf!

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Dwarf, are you okay?

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Thank you for saving me with your tears

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I promise I will free you from your friends

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Vega, attack

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Hurry

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 We are here to save our friends

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Good, if so, attack

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 These dwarfs deserve to be taught

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 We can't hurt the dwarfs, we have to work with them

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 You don't know how to teach me

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Professor Purwa, it's not our fault, we should try first

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 We don't have much time

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 You are lying, you have to endure it

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Attack!

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Attack!

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 It's clear that they are weak

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 If so, why do we waste our energy just to fight?

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 That's why we have to listen to their opinions

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 They are still young, but sometimes they are smarter than adults

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Alpha, ask them

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Where are your friends?

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Please tell me where are our friends that you kidnapped?

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 What are you doing? Are you playing?

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Calm down, professor

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 The Dwarf Fairy can't talk

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Lightning!

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Lightning!

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It seems like Alpha is right

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 They are not fake

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But they can't talk because of one thing

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 But how can they be so loud?

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Why can't you talk?

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Who is he?

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 You were ordered to do this?

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I read your mind

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I'm not a fool

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I'm not a fool

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I'm not a fool

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I'm not a fool

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'm not a fool

83
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I'm not a fool

84
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Absolutely man?

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,980
 There is no way.

86
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,020
 With those two little fangs,

87
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,000
 you are definitely not a successor to the Black Kite.

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 You are just a mere agent.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 He's no other than the Alexander Kvass,

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 the world's greatest detective.

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So, what are you doing here?

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It is a mission from all of you.

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 you can't talk?

 I am...

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 the decision of the 8th Prince.

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I have stolen your voice.

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And if you want your voice back,

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 then...

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 you have to kidnap 8 children from a magic school.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And one of those children...

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 must be a boy named Alva.

110
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Those children...

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 must be taken to the headquarters of the 8th Prince...

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 which is located here.

113
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 The headquarters is a secret.

114
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 So...

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 you can't tell anyone about it.

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And if one of you...

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 leak it,

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 then...

119
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 you will all be cursed to be a bully!

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 The 8th Prince said that you have to kidnap 8 children.

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 How many?

 two more children are missing.

 Why do we teach you kids?

147
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,540
 We will be bored, sir.

148
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,620
 We don't get bored anymore!

149
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
 I am ready, mom.

 Don't worry, Tentarang.

 We have already fought the three-headed dragon.

193
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
 Karim, please.

194
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 I know, I heard your voice.

195
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
 I was thinking how to get out of here.

196
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
 I cried.

197
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,520
 I'm so sad.

 What happened?

213
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
 They must know about the trap.

214
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
 And they deliberately destroyed it.

215
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,520
 If it's not a trap, how can we stop them?

216
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,520
 This is all because of Professor Purwa.

217
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
 Because of you, Purwa.

218
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
 Now, Ava's life is in danger.

219
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,520
 Megantara, what do you mean?

220
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
 This is not my fault.

221
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 But it's true.

222
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 You threatened me.

223
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,520
 I was trying to save the children.

224
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
 What?

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
 Megantara!

226
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 Enough.

 We're caught.

 We're caught.

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520

 Where's our cage?

 Oh, right.

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
 Where's my cage?

262
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
 Maybe, they found it.

263
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,520
 If we lose our cage,

264
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
 the teachers won't know where we are.

265
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
 We'll be in trouble.

266
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
 I don't know.

267
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:31,520

 I'm sorry.

288
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,520
 Thank you for still recognizing me.

 Professor.

290
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 Why are you here?

291
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
 You should be in jail.

292
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,520
 You underestimated me.

293
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
 A prison like that...

294
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 is nothing to me.

 And you, Alva.

 Don't be happy...

297
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
 because you took my tongsis.

298
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
 Because without tongsis,

299
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520

 Which one should we take?

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,520
 We should split up.

00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
 I think that's smoke.

368
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
 It's a message from the children.

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,520
 Let me face this.

385
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:16,520
 Everything is ready.

386
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,520
 Let's continue our journey.

387
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
 Let's go.

388
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:38,520
 Don't be afraid.

389

 [To be continued]

390
00:31:42,520 --> 00:32:05,520
 We have to use the water.

391
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
 Let's go.

392
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
 Help!

00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:23,520
 Thank you.

405
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,520
 Let's go.

408
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:47,520
 Anggara?

409
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,520
 So, you are the one who set the trap.

410
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
 Anggara.

411
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,520
 You managed to escape from the dungeon.

412
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:05,520
 You underestimate my magic power.

413
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
 You think...

414
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,520
 ...I can't escape from a cheap dungeon like that?

415
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,520
 Anggara, let me face this.

416
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
 You guys, get to the water.

417
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
 Hurry up.

418
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,520
 You guys, go.

419
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
 Hurry up.

420
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,520
 [To be continued]

421
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:40,520
 The coconut fruit is eaten by the tiger.

422
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
 Where do you want to go, Anggara?

423
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:52,520
 The door is broken.

424
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
 Let's go.

425
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,520
 Wait.

426
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,520
 Isn't this the energy transfer crystal?

427
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,520
 This weapon is very dangerous.

428
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,520
 This crystal can collect the energy of the people who want it.

429
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
 And it can absorb the energy until it's exhausted.

430
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
 We don't have much time.

431
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,520
 We have to destroy this crystal ball.

432
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,520
 If the crystal ball is full, it means the children's energy is absorbed.

433
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
 The children can die.

434
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
 I will destroy it.

435
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,520
 Avancur!

436
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,520
 Let's attack.

437
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,520

 Good bye, Professor Megantara.

446
00:36:50,520 --> 00:37:01,520
 Go to Japan through the north.

447
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,520
 It's easy to defeat Megantara.

449
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,520
 Let's destroy it together.

450
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
 Yes, sir.

451
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,520

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
 Tommy.

457
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
 Tommy.

458
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,520
 Are you okay?

459
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
 Are you okay?

460
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:47,520
 It seems that the destruction of the crystal ball destroyed this place.

461
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
 We have to get out of here.

462
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
 Come on, hurry up.

463
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
 Hurry up.

464
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
 Hurry up.

465
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
 Hurry up.

466
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
 Okay.

 Vega.

 Vega.

477
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,520
 Professor!

478
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:06,520
 Megantara is still inside.

479
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
 Is Centara also with them?

480
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
 Yes, she's fighting against Ankara.

481
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
 What about Centara?

482
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
 Alpha, wait!

483
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,520
 Alpha!

484
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:33,520
 Centara!

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,520
 Megantara, where are you?

486
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
 Centara!

487
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
 Alpha.

488
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,520
 I'm here!

489
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
 I'm here, Megantara.

490
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
 Megantara!

491
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,520
 Megantara.

492
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
 Alpha.

493
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,520
 Professor, I'm here.

494
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,520
 Thank you, Professor.

495
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
 Let's go.

496
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,520
 This is Centara.

497
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:29,520
 It's dangerous. All the roads are closed.

498
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
 What should we do, Professor?

499
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
 Alpha, Professor.

500
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
 Look, there's a hole.

501
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
 It's enough for two people.

502
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
 Alpha, come on.

503
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
 Go inside that hole.

504
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
 Hurry!

505
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,520
 Come on, Professor.

506
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
 Go inside. Follow Alpha.

507
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
 No, Megantara. You go inside.

508
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
 You can take care of it later.

509
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
 Professor, go inside.

510
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
 Stay in the middle.

511
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,520
 Where's Megantara?

512
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
 What's wrong?

513
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:27,520
 Don't leave me again!

514
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,520
 We can do this!

515
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:42,520
 We can do this!

516
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
 Centara, please.

517
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
 Centara.

518
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
 Don't leave me.

519
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,520
 Centara, wake up.

520
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,520
 You promised me.

521
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,520
 Don't leave me, Centara.

522
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
 Wake up, Centara.

523
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,520
 Centara!

524
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,520
 Wake up, Centara!

525
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,520
 Centara! Wake up!

526
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,520
 Wake up, Centara!

527
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
 Centara!

528
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:33,520
 Centara, wake up!

529
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,520
 Centara, wake up.

530
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
 Centara.

531
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
 Centara.

532
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,520
 Alpha, Megantara, hold on.

533
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,520
 Centara.

534
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,520
 Be careful. Don't push me.

535
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
 I'll smash your head.

536
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:29,520
 Coconut fruit.

537
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
 Coconut fruit.

538
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,520
 Alpha.

539
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,520
 Don't cry.

540
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
 Smile.

541
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,520
 I promised you...

542
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,520
 ...that I'll save you all.

543
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,520
 Captain Megantara...

544
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,520
 ...never breaks his promise.

545
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
 Okay.

546
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,520
 Where's your tuxedo?

547
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
 (Megantara's tuxedo)

548
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:17,520
 It's okay.

549
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,520
 Didiung, you can talk now?

550
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
 Yes.

551
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,520
 It's because the magic has gone.

552
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
 The place is ruined.

553
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
 (Megantara's tuxedo)

554
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:37,520
 Thank you, Putih Diung.

555
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,520
 I'm so happy that you've saved us.

556
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
 My name is Tiara.

557
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
 I'm so happy to meet you.

558
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
 We'll come back here again.

559
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
 Right, Alpha?

560
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
 Yes, I'm happy to meet you too.

561
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,520
 You're good kids.

562
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,520
 I'm thankful that you saved me.

563
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
 (Megantara's tuxedo)

564
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:05,520
 Putih Tiara, what's wrong?

565
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
 Are you sick?

566
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,520
 Putih Tiara!

567
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,520
 Putih Tiara!

568
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
 Where are you?

569
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,520
 This is all because of the Dark Lord's curse.

570
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,520
 Putih Tiara has leaked the kids' whereabouts.

571
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,520
 And now, she's being possessed by the magic.

572
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,520
 Tiara...

573
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
 (The Dark Lord's curse)

574
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:57,520
 It's more dangerous than the dark lord.

575
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,520
 Let's just play.

576
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,520
 How about we go to the lake?

577
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,520
 I don't want to go to the lake.

578
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,520
 I don't want to go to the lake. I'll remember you.

579
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
 I don't want to.

580
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:23,520
 He left me.

581
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,520
 Fine. If you don't want to play, I'll play.

582
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
 (The Dark Lord's curse)

583
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:42,520
 No, don't.

584
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
 It's going to be dark again.

585
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,520
 No, don't!

586
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
 Don't hurt me again.

587
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
 Don't be afraid.

588
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
 We're not going to harm humans anymore.

589
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
 Are you serious?

590
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
 Yes.

591
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,520
 Why are you alone?

592
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
 What else can I do?

593
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,520
 Because Alva and Vega are still sad.

594
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
 Because Putih Tiara is possessed.

595
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,520
 Don't be like that.

596
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
 Come here.

597
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
 I want to talk to you.

598
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
 What?

599
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
 (The Dark Lord's curse)

600
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:41,520
 I'm going to be Alva, Vega.

601
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,520
 I'm going to be a witch.

602
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,520
 Please, don't go.

603
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
 Please, Putih Tiara. Don't go.

604
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,520
 Putih Tiara, I'm sad.

605
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:06,520
 Go away.

606
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,520
 I'm not fit.

607
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,520
 Vega.

608
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
 You're so weird.

609
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
 I have a new surprise for you.

610
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
 I'm Jamon.

611
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
 I'm sure you won't be sad.

612
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,520
 No, we're going to the orphanage.

613
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
 Me too.

614
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
 It's true.

615
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
 You don't want to meet Putih Tiara.

616
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,520
 Don't lie.

617
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,520
 It's true. I'm not lying.

618
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
 Be careful if you lie.

619
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
 But on one condition.

620
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,520
 Alva, you have to be a girl.

621
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,520
 It's not funny.

622
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
 It's true.

623
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
 Just follow me.

624
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,520
 Is she a girl?

625
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,520
 I don't know.

626
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:05,520
 I'm not comfortable.

627
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,520
 Where is Putih Tiara?

628
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,520
 If you're lying, I'll tie you up.

629
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
 Just wait.

630
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
 They'll come.

631
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
 What?

632
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
 They.

633
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,520
 They.

634
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,520
 Let's go.

635
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:33,520
 Girls.

636
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,520
 Girls.

637
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:51,520
 That's Putih Tiara.

638
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:58,520
 Remember what I said?

639
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,520
 I met Putih Duyung.

640
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,520
 He told me...

641
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,520
 ...that if you're a girl, you have to take Putih Tiara's mother.

642
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
 So, she can live.

643
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,520
 And then, she'll be a girl.

644
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
 Hurry up.

645
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,520
 Wait for me.

646
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,520
 They don't like men.

647
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
 Hurry up.

648
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,520
 To be continued...

649
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,520
 To be continued...

650
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,520
 To be continued...

651
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,520
 To be continued...

652
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,520
 Putih Tiara.

653
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:55,520
 I'm happy to see you again.

654
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,520
 Girls.

655
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,520
 Girls.

656
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:37,520
 It's so fun.

657
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,520
 There's another man.

658
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:56,520
 Where are you going?

659
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,520
 Thank you, Rek.

660
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,520
 I'm so happy to meet you, Tiara.

661
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,520
 Me too.

662
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,520
 It's just for a while.

663
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,520
 But I'm happy because he's a good boy.

664
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
 I know.

665
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,520
 But I'm so weak.

666
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:23,520
 Attention, girls.

667
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,520
 Starting tomorrow, you'll have a mid-semester vacation.

668
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,520
 And you'll do a field trip to a magic village...

669
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
 ...not far from the school.

670
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,520
 Yes!

671
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,520
 There, you'll stay at a guest house...

672
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,520
 ...and have a chat with the magic people.

673
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,520
 Professor Agni, Purwa, and Megantara...

674
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
 ...will accompany you...

675
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
 ...to watch you...

676
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
 ...so you don't do anything stupid.

677
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
 Do you understand?

678
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
 Yes, sir.

679
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
 (The Magic Village)

680
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:13,520
 There will be a sports competition in the village.

681
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
 It will be fun.

682
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
 There are a lot of food.

683
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
 We'll eat a lot.

684
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,520
 It must be fun.

685
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
 Yes, I can't wait to go there.

686
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
 Yes!

687
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:50,520
 We have a result.

688
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
 I just heard...

689
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,520
 ...that the kids from the magic school will host a field trip to the magic village.

690
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
 And I think...

691
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,520
 ...we can attack Alva there.

692
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,520
 I won't fail this time.

693
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,520
 So I can regain my strength.

694
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,520
 I must get that kid.

695
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
 Don't worry, sir.

696
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,520
 I'll give you whatever you want.

697
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,520
 (The Magic Village)

698
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
 Alva!

699
00:55:46,520 --> 00:56:04,520
 How did you get in here?

700
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,520
 Don't be a spy, Alva.

701
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,520
 Why?

702
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
 It's dangerous, Alva.

703
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,520
 Please, don't go.

704
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,520
 But why?

705
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,520
 You said you wanted to join the field trip.

706
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,520
 I said no.

707
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,520
 The event must be fun.

708
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,520
 Okay.

709
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,520
 We'll always be there.

710
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,520
 Where is he?

711
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
 It was just a dream.

712
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
 But...

713
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,520
 What does it mean?

714
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,520
 Why was I forbidden to join the field trip?

715
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,520
 Why?

716
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,520
 Those two...

717
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,520
 ...always appear in my dreams.

718
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
 And they give me a headache.

719
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,520
 Kids.

720
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
 We'll leave soon.

721
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
 On the count of three,

722
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,520
 we'll say the spell together.

723
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
 One.

724
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
 Two.

725
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
 Three.

726
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
 Four.

727
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
 Five.

728
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,520
 (The Magic Village)

729
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
 (The Magic Village)

730
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,520
 (The Magic Village)

731
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,520
 (The Magic Village)

732
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,520
 (The Magic Village)

733
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:33,520
 (The Magic Village)

734
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:45,520
 (The Magic Village)

735
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,520
 (The Magic Village)

736
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:57,520
 They're here.

737
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,520
 Oh, yes.

738
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,520
 As we've predicted,

739
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,520
 one of them...

740
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
 will open the door...

741
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,520
 and make chaos in this village.

742
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
 Nik.

743
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,520
 Now, you'll meet the village head, Mr. Galaksi.

744
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,520
 Tell him that we're here.

745
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
 And then,

746
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,520
 you'll come back here.

747
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,520
 Yes, ma'am.

748
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:31,520
 Come on, kids.

749
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
 Let's see.

750
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
 (The Magic Village)

751
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:54,520
 (The Magic Village)

752
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,520
 Where did you go?

753
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
 It's here.

754
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
 Nik.

755
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,520
 Faiqa.

756
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,520
 Faiqa.

757
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,520
 Faiqa.

758
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,520
 Where are you?

759
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
 We can't be separated.

760
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
 We have to be together.

761
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,520
 Come on, kids.

762
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
 Come on, everyone.

763
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,520
 Faiqa.

764
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,520
 Faiqa.

765
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,520
 Faiqa.

766
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
 Faiqa.

767
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,520
 Faiqa.

768
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,520
 That's the test, Nik.

769
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,520
 Yes, it is.

770
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,520
 (The Magic Village)

771
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,520
 (The Magic Village)

772
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:46,520
 Karnik.

773
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,520
 Karnik.

774
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,520
 Karnik.

775
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,520
 Why did Karnik turn into a rock?

776
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
 Maybe he's possessed?

777
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
 Oh, no.

778
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,520
 (The Magic Village)

779
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:20,520
 It turns out that the prophecy is true.

780
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
 The disaster is here.

781
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,520
 We will all be possessed by the legendary monster.

782
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,520
 Yes, it is.

783
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:35,520
 The legendary monster?

784
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,520
 What did that man mean?

785
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,520
 What is the legendary monster?

786
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:51,520
 What really happened here?

787
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
 I don't know.

788
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,520
 Don't worry.

789
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,520
 Megantara will be back.

790
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,520
 Who are you?

791
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,520
 I'm a monster.

792
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:14,520
 I'm a powerful monster.

793
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,520
 What's going on, Nik and Karnik?

794
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,520
 Why are you here?

795
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,520
 I have a clue about what happened here.

796
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
