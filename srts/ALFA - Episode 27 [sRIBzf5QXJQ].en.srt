00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Okay, Vega, just drink it

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You better not be weak

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Even if Professor Angkara punish you

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Let him be

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Yes, Vega

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Professor Ragni is right

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 You better drink it

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Now

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Instead of being caught by Professor Angkara

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 We'll be punished

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I don't want to be punished

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Yes, Vega

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'll keep an eye on you

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 If there's Professor Angkara

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I'll tell him

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Listen to your friend

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Now, drink it

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 So you won't be weak

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Ragni

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I told you not to help him

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Angkara

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Poor Vega, he's weak

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 If you want to punish him, just do it

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 You better release him, Vega

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Enough

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 I don't want to talk about this anymore

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Vega

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Your sentence is over

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Seriously?

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I never lie

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 About what I said

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Thank you, Professor

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Vega, come back here

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Vega

231
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Professor

232
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Professor

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 I'm sorry

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 For all my actions

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I'll get a permit

243
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Permit?

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Thank you, Professor

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Thank you

246
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I'm going

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I'm sorry

248
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 For the Professor

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I'm sorry

250
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And this

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Give all these permits to your students

252
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 As a request from me

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Thank you, Professor

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Thank you, Professor

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Let's go, Vega

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 I'm sorry

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Why?

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Angkara is a good guy now

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Lucky

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 The punishment

261
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Is not stopped

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He gave me a permit

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I'm so lucky

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Don't you feel bad for Professor Angkara?

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Why did he suddenly

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Do that to us?

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 He freed me from the punishment

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And apologized to all of us

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 After that

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 He gave me a permit

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Why is he like Professor Titan?

273
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Why is he laughing?

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And then?

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 I'll clean this up

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I'm so lucky

277
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I'm so lucky

278
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Sir

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Have you done your job?

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Yes, sir

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I've freed all the punishment

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Yes

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Sir

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Are you okay?

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I think something is wrong with you

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I'm okay

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 What's our next plan?

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Our next plan?

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Yes

290
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I'll be a good son

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 What's our next plan?

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 I...

293
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I...

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I have a plan

295
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 What is it?

296
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 But

297
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Before that

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I want to know

299
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Where is Professor Aldo Baran?

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Didn't you already know?

301
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Yes, but

302
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I didn't ask you to tell me

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Yes, I know

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 You're the one who told me

305
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 To find out where Professor Aldo Baran is

306
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Sir

307
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Sir, please be nice

308
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 What?

309
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I'm being nice?

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Yes, sir

311
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I'm sorry, sir

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I think something is wrong with you

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Are you trying to steal from me?

314
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 No, sir

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I just...

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 That's enough

317
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I'm leaving

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I have other things to do

319
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I'm sorry, sir

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I think something is wrong with you

321
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 In the dark world

322
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 We're not so sure

323
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 If we meet someone

324
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 We don't know if that person is the real one

325
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 So

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 The enemy is coming

327
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 No, no

328
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Someone is trying to steal from me

329
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Where are you going?

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Wait

331
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Rey, wait

332
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 You look like the dark one

333
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 You're not going to tell Rey?

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I'm sure I ran away

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I'm sure

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I was right

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 All of these are

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 The naughty kids

339
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 This is too much

340
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 How dare they

341
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Call me the dark one

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Guys

343
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 We have to run

344
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 What for?

345
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 There's a terrorist

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Run

347
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Wait and see

348
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Where are they?

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 That was fast

350
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I'm going to get them

351
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 This time they succeeded in kidnapping me

352
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 But next time

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I won't be fooled

354
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 By those naughty kids

355
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Watch out

356
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I think it's safe

357
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 We have to tell the others

358
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Wait

359
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Why?

360
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 You always use water

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Because it's scary

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Let's go

363
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Soldiers

364
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 We found it

365
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 The source of the water

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 We're great, right?

367
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 You're great

368
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 It's not a waste

369
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 You're chosen as the Aldebaran soldiers

370
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 You can find drinking water

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Cool

372
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Thank you

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Look at our faces

374
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 We brought it for you

375
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Thank you

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 You're welcome

377
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 I want to drink it first

378
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Give it to me

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Let's do a sweet

380
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Me?

381
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Me

382
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I'll drink it first

383
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Stop

384
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Soldiers

385
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 We're thirsty

386
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Don't drink that water

387
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Stop

388
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Nick

389
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Stop

390
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Nick

391
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Stop

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 They're poisoned

393
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 So you used the source of the water

394
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 To make the anchor

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 You're so brave

396
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Give me a smile

397
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 You're smart

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I admire your bravery

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 But when are we going to call the soldiers

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 From the fire prison?

401
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Alva

402
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 The fire prison is far away

403
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Whoever goes there

404
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Will never come back

405
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 We can't give up yet

406
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 We have to find a way

407
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 To get the professor out

408
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 How?

409
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Don't worry, leave it to me

410
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I'll find a way to get the professor out

411
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Give me a smile

412
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Sorry

413
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I'm flustered

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 It's okay

415
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Give me a smile

416
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Professor Agni

417
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 How are you going to get out of here?

418
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 The anchor will come for you

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Don't worry

420
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I'll think of something

421
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Give me a smile

422
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Thank you, professor Agni

423
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 You're great

424
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Look

425
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 If I see them again

426
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I'll sue you

427
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Why are you still here?

428
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Someone wants to talk to you

429
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Enough

430
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 I know who you are

431
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Stop pretending

432
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 You can either do it or I'll sue you

433
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 What do you mean?

434
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Stop pretending

435
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I could be fooled

436
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 But now

437
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I can't anymore

438
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 You better confess

439
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Or I'll sue you

440
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 You're rude

441
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 You dare to deceive the head of the school

442
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Don't make me angry

443
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Fine

444
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I'll sue you

445
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I'll sue you

446
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Why didn't you say anything?

447
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 What do you mean?

448
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 What do you mean?

449
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Why did you insult me?

450
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 I'm sorry

451
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I thought it was my students

452
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Because one of them

453
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Wanted to be a teacher

454
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And he sued me

455
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 So, you should be a teacher

456
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Don't be stupid

457
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 You have to be strong

458
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Even though you hurt the students

459
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Especially you

460
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I'll give you one more chance

461
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You destroy the school

462
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Don't let it fail

463
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I'll sue you

464
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I'll wait for your answer

465
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 You can do it

466
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 You're professor Agni

467
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Why did you come to my class?

468
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Do you finally want to admit

469
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 That I'm the head of the school

470
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And I'm the head of the school

471
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But it's the opposite

472
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I'm here because I want to quit

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 You're lying

474
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 You're lying

475
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Are you sure?

476
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 You want to quit the school?

477
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 That's your dream

478
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 I know that

479
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 My decision is final

480
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I can't be changed

481
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Agni!

482
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 I'm sorry

483
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Call me

484
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Call you?

485
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I'm sorry

486
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Call you

487
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 You asked me to do it

488
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I'm sorry

489
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I thought you're still in front of me

490
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I'm sorry

491
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I'm sorry

492
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I'm sorry

493
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 What did you call me?

494
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I'm sorry

495
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 You're fired

496
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 You're safe now

497
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Let's go

498
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 That's the thief

499
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 I was with my friends

500
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And we found the thief

501
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 That's creepy

502
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 We have to tell professor Angkara

503
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 So we can get the prize

504
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Okay

505
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Professor Angkara!

506
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Professor!

507
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 We want to tell you something important

508
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 We want to tell you something important

509
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 We want to tell you something important

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 We want to tell you something important

511
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 We want to tell you something important

512
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 We want to tell you something important

513
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 What is it?

514
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Professor, you scared us

515
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 We want to tell you something important

516
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 We want to tell you something important

517
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 What is it?

518
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 The thief

519
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 The thief

520
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 What is it?

521
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 You're so loud

522
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 How can I hear you?

523
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 You're confusing me

524
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Speak one by one

525
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 You!

526
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Enough!

527
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 You must be quiet

528
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 I don't have much time

529
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 The thief that was here yesterday

530
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 He's in this school

531
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He's friends with Alva

532
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 His friends

533
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Friends with Alva?

534
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Yes

535
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He's a student

536
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 His name is Panji

537
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Not Panji

538
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Panji!

539
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 His real name is

540
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Panji

541
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Panji

542
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Panji?

543
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 He's in the school's next door

544
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 He's in the school's next door

545
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 So, the real Panji

546
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So, the real Panji

547
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 The thief that was here yesterday

548
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 The thief that was here yesterday

549
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 He's a student

550
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 He's a student

551
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Where are you going?

552
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Where are you going?

553
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Where's our gift?

554
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Where's our gift?

555
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Maybe he's not here

556
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Maybe he's not here

557
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Maybe he's not here

558
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Let's follow him

559
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 The first plan has succeeded

560
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Now, it's time for me to free Prof. Alvara

561
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 My dear Otel!

562
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 My dear Otel!

563
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 He's here!

564
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 We can do it!

565
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 We can do it!

566
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 We can do it!

567
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 We can do it!

568
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 We can do it!

569
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 We can do it!

570
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Look

571
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 I've prepared all of that for you

572
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 What is it, Sir?

573
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 What is it, Sir?

574
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Why are you asking again?

575
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Why are you asking again?

576
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's all for you to practice

577
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 It's all for you to practice

578
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 The magic

579
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 The magic

580
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 The magic

581
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Can I practice without hurting anyone?

582
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Can I practice without hurting anyone?

583
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I don't want to, Sir

584
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 I don't want to, Sir

585
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 If you don't practice with this animal

586
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 If you don't practice with this animal

587
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 How can you be strong?

588
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 How can you be strong?

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Do you want to be weak?

590
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 That's it

591
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Now, you have to free the animal one by one

592
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Now, you have to free the animal one by one

593
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Now, you have to free the animal one by one

594
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 What is it?

595
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Leo

596
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Leo, you can do it

597
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Leo, you can do it

598
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 The magic

599
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 The magic

600
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Vika

601
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Good, Sir

602
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Good, Sir

603
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Look, the cat is angry

604
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 People who do evil

605
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Must be punished

606
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Natural punishment

607
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Shut up, Leon

608
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Don't teach me

609
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Do it, I said

610
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Keep on doing it

611
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Come on

612
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 What is this?

613
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 What is this?

614
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Keep on doing it

615
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Come on

616
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Keep on doing it, Leon

617
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Good

618
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Keep on doing it, Leon

619
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Keep on doing it, Leon

620
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Keep on doing it, Leon

621
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Keep on doing it, Leon

622
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 What is it, Sir?

623
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Their power is getting weaker

624
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Their power is getting weaker

625
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 They are hungry

626
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 They are thirsty

627
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 They are thirsty

628
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 They are thirsty

629
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 What should we do?

630
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 What should we do?

631
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 We are just like this

632
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 What if we become three?

633
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 What if we become three?

634
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 We will die

635
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 We will die

636
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 We will die

637
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 We will die

638
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 We will die

639
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Shout, shout

640
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Calm down, please

641
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Our friend is like this

642
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 How can we calm down?

643
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 How can we cure them?

644
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 We have the antidote

645
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 You are right, Pijat

646
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 The antidote

647
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 We are now for the antidote

648
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 To cure them

649
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 You must bring

650
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 You must bring

651
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 The book about the antidote

652
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Just bring it

653
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 In your bag

654
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Try it

655
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Tentara, this is the book

656
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Yes, Tentara

657
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 I have read

658
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 About the antidote

659
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 For poison

660
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 If our body is poisoned

661
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 By the water of padang burung

662
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Wait a minute

663
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 The antidote

664
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 For poison

665
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 By the water of padang burung

666
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Here it is

667
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 The antidote to cure

668
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 The person whose body

669
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Is poisoned by the water of padang burung

670
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Can be cured

671
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 By using

672
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 The flower of the devil cactus

673
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Praise the lord

674
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 For the success of yesterday

675
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Yes

676
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 They can be cured by the flower of the devil cactus

677
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 That we faced yesterday

678
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Come on, what are you waiting for?

679
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Let's go

680
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Why are you quiet?

681
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 You four

682
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Have passed the test

683
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Chosen as the brave soldiers

684
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Don't be a coward

685
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 You can't face the devil cactus

686
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 You don't deserve to be brave

687
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 The soldiers are brave

688
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 To fight the cactus

689
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 No

690
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Therefore

691
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 To fight the devil cactus

692
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 I need your help

693
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 If we work together

694
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 We can

695
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Defeat it

696
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Oh my

697
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Soldiers

698
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 We are not strong anymore

699
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 We are weak

700
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 We haven't drunk or eaten

701
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 What else to eat?

702
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Let's fight the cactus

703
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 We have lost

704
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Go home

705
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Eat a lot

706
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 If only

707
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 The food falls from the sky

708
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Wow

709
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Food

710
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Soldiers

711
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Pray to the lord

712
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Soldiers

713
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 The cactus is really cool

714
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Really

715
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 The food falls from the sky

716
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Wow

717
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Since when

718
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I read

719
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 The cactus can be this powerful

720
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 The cactus can be this powerful

721
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 My cactus

722
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 My cactus

723
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 He's here

724
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 Hotel

725
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 Hotel

726
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Go to the hotel

727
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Bring the kite

728
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Buy the kite

729
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 And the fish

730
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 My dear hotel

731
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 I miss you

732
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Let's see

733
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Did you bring my order?

734
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Bring a lot of food

735
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Complete everything

736
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Good hotel

737
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 This is a bad hotel

738
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Why did you just come?

739
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 I'm hungry

740
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Oh my god

741
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 You're not as strong as before

742
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 You didn't come since yesterday

743
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 You're stupid

744
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 I'm hungry

745
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 So

746
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Don't you dare

747
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 To insult my bike

748
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Now feel the consequences

749
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 This is a bike

750
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 You can be angry

751
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Feel it

752
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 For now

753
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 You can stay here

754
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 There's no army

755
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Okay

756
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Thank you

757
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 It's okay

758
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Sir

759
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Sir

760
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Sir

761
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Sir

762
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Sir

763
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Where's the man?

764
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Man?

765
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 You mean the professor?

766
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Don't be stupid

767
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I know you know a man

768
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Called Panji

769
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 No

770
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 We don't know him

771
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 We don't know him

772
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 We saw him

773
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 He's coming here

774
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Don't be stupid

775
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Shut up

776
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 I'm just asking you to be honest

777
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 If not

778
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 You and all your friends

779
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Will be punished severely

780
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Does the professor

781
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Have proof that I'm lying?

782
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Don't lie to me

783
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 I know the proof

784
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 I know you're drinking Ramuan

785
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 To change your face

786
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 And you're changing yourself

787
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000

 I won't die easily

835
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Because of a coward like you

836
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 We can do it

837
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:32,000

 He won't be able to see

840
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 A tragedy like this

 And when he's here

842
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000

 That's when I'll finish him

00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 You're a bad person

845
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 You think I'll just stay quiet

 Don't you dare insult me

861
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000

 Who did this?

870
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 Is this your power?

871
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 It's not us

872
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000

 Now, it's time for us to take action

 Okay, what we will do to attack this giant cactus

910
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600

00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,600
 So that later it will be attacked by the cactus

916

 This is a very dangerous task

922
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,600
 Who will be the bait?

923
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600

00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,600

 Hey, Srigala

 So he knows

984
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,600
 That his poor fruit child

985
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,600
 Has killed him

986
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
 Hmm?

987
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,600
 You think I don't want to threaten your peanuts?

988
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,600
 Okay, if you're not afraid

989
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,600
 Now put down your staff

990
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
 Or do you regret it?

991
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
 Put it down!

992
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,600
 If you're not afraid

993
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,600
 Now I will also find the 8th prince

994
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:17,600
 See you

995
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,600
 Wait!

996
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,600
 Okay

997
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,600
 I will obey your will

998
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,600
 Hurry up!

999
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,600
 You've been like this for a while

1000
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,600
 Now hurry

1001
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,600
 You go there

1002
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,600
 You free them

1003
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,600

00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,600
 Come on, hurry

 [Laughter]

1006
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,600
 You're a fool

1007
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,600
 You're afraid of that?

1008
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,600
 I don't know where the 8th prince is

1009
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:10,600

1012
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:26,600
 I warn you all

1013
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,600
 If you lie to me again

1014
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,600
 I will give you to Barga

1015
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
 And Barga will eat you

1016
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
 Barga?

1017
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
 Not Barga?

1018
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,600
 I'm going to destroy you, sir!

1019
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
 Shut up, you fool!

1020
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
 Enough!

1021
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
 Follow my order!

00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
 Thank you

1024
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
 Now we're free

1025
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:56,600
 Yes!

00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,600
 We're free!

 We're free!

 I'm sorry, Dad

 I haven't got the cactus flower yet

 Only a drop of blood

1079

 It's about my parents

01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,600
 [The sorcerer is here]

1175
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:45,600
 The sorcerer's aroma is gone

1176
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
 Where is he?

1177
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,600
 They can't see

1178
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,600
 They can only sense

1179
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,600
 That's why I turned into a cat

1180
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,600
 So they don't realize

1181
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:12,600
 That's what my parents said in my dream

1182
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:17,600
 Ufa, are we going to fight the dark?

1183
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,600
 Are you kidding?

1184
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,600
 You're crazy

1185
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
 We're just being chased

1186
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,600
 We're already in trouble

1187
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,600
 But I don't want to fight

1188
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,600
 I just want to take his blood

1189
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,600
 What should we do?

1190
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,600
 Alva, what should we do?

1191
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,600
 If we want to get the dark's blood

1192
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,600
 We have to fight him first

1193
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,600
 What should we do?

1194
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
 I don't know

1195
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,600
 We're just seeing his face

1196
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,600
 We don't have to be afraid

1197
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
 I'm scared

1198
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,600
 I'm scared

1199
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,600
 I think I can get the dark

1200
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,600
 That's the person we can trust

1201
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:03,600
 The person we can trust?

1202
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,600
 It must be Angkara

1203
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,600
 That's right!

1204
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,600
 I'm going to be Angkara's professor

1205
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,600
 That's good

1206
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,600
 What's next?

1207
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,600
 Are you going to use the magic potion again?

1208
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,600
 I think we shouldn't be afraid

1209
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
 We should not be reminded

1210
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,600
 Angkara's professor has a plan

1211
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,600
 He must be aware of us

1212
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,600
 That's right

1213
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,600
 Have you forgotten?

1214
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,600
 We've been taught to change our minds

1215
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,600
 We always feel like we're old

1216
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,600
 We're going to be the new generation

1217
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,600
 We're going to be the new generation

1218
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,600
 We're going to be the new generation

1219
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,600
 We're going to be the new generation

1220
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,600
 We're going to be the new generation

1221
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,600
 What's going on?

1222
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,600
 Stop!

1223
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,600
 The army is here!

1224
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,600
 It looks like we're going to be there soon

1225
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,600
 Finally, the army is here

1226
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,600
 Wait!

1227
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,600
 We can't work like that anymore

1228
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,600
 The plane is too fast

1229
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,600
 It's going to take off

1230
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
 Let's use the magic potion

1231
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,600
