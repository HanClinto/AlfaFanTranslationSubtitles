00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Listen to your friend

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Now, drink it

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So you won't be weak

200
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Ragni

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I told you not to help him

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Angkara

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Poor Vega, he's weak

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you want to punish him, just do it

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You better release him, Vega

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Enough

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't want to talk about this anymore

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Vega

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Your sentence is over

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Seriously?

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I never lie

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
About what I said

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Thank you, Professor

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Vega, come back here

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Vega

216
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Professor

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Professor

219
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
For all my actions

221
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll get a permit

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Permit?

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you, Professor

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm going

227
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
For the Professor

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry

230
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And this

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Give all these permits to your students

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
As a request from me

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you, Professor

234
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's go, Vega

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Why?

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Angkara is a good guy now

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Lucky

239
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The punishment

240
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Is not stopped

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He gave me a permit

242
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm so lucky

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't you feel bad for Professor Angkara?

245
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why did he suddenly

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Do that to us?

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He freed me from the punishment

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And apologized to all of us

249
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
After that

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
He gave me a permit

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Why is he like Professor Titan?

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why is he laughing?

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And then?

254
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll clean this up

255
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm so lucky

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Sir

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Have you done your job?

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes, sir

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I've freed all the punishment

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Sir

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Are you okay?

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think something is wrong with you

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm okay

265
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What's our next plan?

266
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Our next plan?

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll be a good son

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What's our next plan?

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I...

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have a plan

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What is it?

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Before that

275
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I want to know

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Where is Professor Aldo Baran?

277
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Didn't you already know?

278
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes, but

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I didn't ask you to tell me

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes, I know

281
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're the one who told me

282
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
To find out where Professor Aldo Baran is

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Sir

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Sir, please be nice

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What?

286
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm being nice?

287
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes, sir

288
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry, sir

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I think something is wrong with you

290
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Are you trying to steal from me?

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, sir

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I just...

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's enough

294
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm leaving

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I have other things to do

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm sorry, sir

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think something is wrong with you

298
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
In the dark world

299
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We're not so sure

300
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If we meet someone

301
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We don't know if that person is the real one

302
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So

303
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The enemy is coming

304
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, no

305
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Someone is trying to steal from me

306
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Where are you going?

307
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Wait

308
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Rey, wait

309
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You look like the dark one

310
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're not going to tell Rey?

311
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm sure I ran away

312
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm sure

313
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was right

314
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
All of these are

315
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The naughty kids

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is too much

317
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
How dare they

318
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Call me the dark one

319
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Guys

320
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We have to run

321
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What for?

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There's a terrorist

323
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Run

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Wait and see

325
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Where are they?

326
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That was fast

327
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm going to get them

328
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This time they succeeded in kidnapping me

329
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But next time

330
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I won't be fooled

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
By those naughty kids

332
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Watch out

333
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I think it's safe

334
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We have to tell the others

335
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wait

336
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why?

337
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You always use water

338
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Because it's scary

339
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Let's go

340
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Soldiers

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We found it

342
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The source of the water

343
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We're great, right?

344
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're great

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's not a waste

346
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You're chosen as the Aldebaran soldiers

347
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You can find drinking water

348
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Cool

349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Thank you

350
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Look at our faces

351
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We brought it for you

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thank you

353
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You're welcome

354
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I want to drink it first

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Give it to me

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's do a sweet

357
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Me?

358
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Me

359
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll drink it first

360
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Stop

361
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Soldiers

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We're thirsty

363
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Don't drink that water

364
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Stop

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Nick

366
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Stop

367
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Nick

368
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Stop

369
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They're poisoned

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So you used the source of the water

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
To make the anchor

372
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're so brave

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Give me a smile

374
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're smart

375
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I admire your bravery

376
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But when are we going to call the soldiers

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
From the fire prison?

378
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Alfa

379
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The fire prison is far away

380
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Whoever goes there

381
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Will never come back

382
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We can't give up yet

383
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We have to find a way

384
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
To get the professor out

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
How?

386
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't worry, leave it to me

387
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll find a way to get the professor out

388
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Give me a smile

389
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Sorry

390
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm flustered

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's okay

392
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Give me a smile

393
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Professor Agni

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
How are you going to get out of here?

395
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The anchor will come for you

396
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Don't worry

397
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'll think of something

398
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Give me a smile

399
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Thank you, professor Agni

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You're great

401
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Look

402
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If I see them again

403
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'll sue you

404
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Why are you still here?

405
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Someone wants to talk to you

406
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Enough

407
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I know who you are

408
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Stop pretending

409
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You can either do it or I'll sue you

410
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What do you mean?

411
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Stop pretending

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I could be fooled

413
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But now

414
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I can't anymore

415
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You better confess

416
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Or I'll sue you

417
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You're rude

418
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You dare to deceive the head of the school

419
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't make me angry

420
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Fine

421
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll sue you

422
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Why didn't you say anything?

423
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What do you mean?

424
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Why did you insult me?

425
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm sorry

426
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I thought it was my students

427
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Because one of them

428
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Wanted to be a teacher

429
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And he sued me

430
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So, you should be a teacher

431
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Don't be stupid

432
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You have to be strong

433
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Even though you hurt the students

434
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Especially you

435
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'll give you one more chance

436
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You destroy the school

437
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Don't let it fail

438
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll sue you

439
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll wait for your answer

440
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You can do it

441
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're professor Agni

442
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Why did you come to my class?

443
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Do you finally want to admit

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That I'm the head of the school

445
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And I'm the head of the school

446
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But it's the opposite

447
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm here because I want to quit

448
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You're lying

449
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Are you sure?

450
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You want to quit the school?

451
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's your dream

452
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I know that

453
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
My decision is final

454
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I can't be changed

455
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Agni!

456
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm sorry

457
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Call me

458
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Call you?

459
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm sorry

460
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Call you

461
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You asked me to do it

462
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm sorry

463
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I thought you're still in front of me

464
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm sorry

465
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What did you call me?

466
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm sorry

467
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You're fired

468
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You're safe now

469
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Let's go

470
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's the thief

471
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I was with my friends

472
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And we found the thief

473
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That's creepy

474
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We have to tell professor Angkara

475
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So we can get the prize

476
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Okay

477
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Professor Angkara!

478
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Professor!

479
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We want to tell you something important

480
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What is it?

481
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Professor, you scared us

482
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We want to tell you something important

483
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What is it?

484
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The thief

485
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What is it?

486
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You're so loud

487
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
How can I hear you?

488
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You're confusing me

489
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Speak one by one

490
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You!

491
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Enough!

492
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You must be quiet

493
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't have much time

494
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The thief that was here yesterday

495
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He's in this school

496
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He's friends with Alfa

497
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
His friends

498
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Friends with Alfa?

499
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yes

500
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He's a student

501
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
His name is Panji

502
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Not Panji

503
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Panji!

504
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
His real name is

505
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Panji

506
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Panji?

507
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
He's in the school's next door

508
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So, the real Panji

509
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The thief that was here yesterday

510
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
He's a student

511
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Where are you going?

512
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Where's our gift?

513
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Maybe he's not here

514
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Let's follow him

515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The first plan has succeeded

516
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Now, it's time for me to free Prof. Alfara

517
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:50,000
My dear Otel!

518
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
He's here!

519
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We can do it!

520
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Look

521
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I've prepared all of that for you

522
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What is it, Sir?

523
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Why are you asking again?

524
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's all for you to practice

525
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The magic

526
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Can I practice without hurting anyone?

527
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't want to, Sir

528
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
If you don't practice with this animal

529
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
How can you be strong?

530
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Do you want to be weak?

531
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That's it

532
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now, you have to free the animal one by one

533
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What is it?

534
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Leo

535
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Leo, you can do it

536
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The magic

537
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Vika

538
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Good, Sir

539
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Look, the cat is angry

540
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
People who do evil

541
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Must be punished

542
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Natural punishment

543
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Shut up, Leon

544
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Don't teach me

545
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Do it, I said

546
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Keep on doing it

547
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on

548
00:33:38,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What is this?

549
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Keep on doing it

550
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Come on

551
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Keep on doing it, Leon

552
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Good

553
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Keep on doing it, Leon

554
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What is it, Sir?

555
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Their power is getting weaker

556
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
They are hungry

557
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
They are thirsty

558
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What should we do?

559
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We are just like this

560
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What if we become three?

561
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We will die

562
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Shout, shout

563
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Calm down, please

564
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Our friend is like this

565
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
How can we calm down?

566
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
How can we cure them?

567
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We have the antidote

568
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You are right, Pijat

569
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
The antidote

570
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
We are now for the antidote

571
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
To cure them

572
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You must bring

573
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The book about the antidote

574
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Just bring it

575
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
In your bag

576
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Try it

577
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Tentara, this is the book

578
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yes, Tentara

579
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I have read

580
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
About the antidote

581
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
For poison

582
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
If our body is poisoned

583
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
By the water of padang burung

584
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Wait a minute

585
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The antidote

586
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
For poison

587
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
By the water of padang burung

588
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Here it is

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
The antidote to cure

590
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The person whose body

591
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Is poisoned by the water of padang burung

592
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Can be cured

593
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
By using

594
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The flower of the devil cactus

595
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Praise the lord

596
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
For the success of yesterday

597
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yes

598
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
They can be cured by the flower of the devil cactus

599
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That we faced yesterday

600
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Come on, what are you waiting for?

601
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let's go

602
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Why are you quiet?

603
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You four

604
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Have passed the test

605
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Chosen as the brave soldiers

606
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Don't be a coward

607
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You can't face the devil cactus

608
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You don't deserve to be brave

609
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The soldiers are brave

610
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
To fight the cactus

611
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
No

612
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Therefore

613
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
To fight the devil cactus

614
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I need your help

615
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
If we work together

616
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We can

617
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Defeat it

618
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh my

619
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Soldiers

620
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We are not strong anymore

621
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
We are weak

622
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We haven't drunk or eaten

623
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What else to eat?

624
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Let's fight the cactus

625
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We have lost

626
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Go home

627
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Eat a lot

628
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
If only

629
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The food falls from the sky

630
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Wow

631
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Food

632
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Soldiers

633
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Pray to the lord

634
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Soldiers

635
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The cactus is really cool

636
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Really

637
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The food falls from the sky

638
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Wow

639
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Since when

640
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I read

641
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The cactus can be this powerful

642
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:24,000
My cactus

643
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
He's here

644
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Hotel

645
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Go to the hotel

646
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Bring the kite

647
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Buy the kite

648
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And the fish

649
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
My dear hotel

650
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I miss you

651
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Let's see

652
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Did you bring my order?

653
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Bring a lot of food

654
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Complete everything

655
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Good hotel

656
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
This is a bad hotel

657
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Why did you just come?

658
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm hungry

659
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh my god

660
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You're not as strong as before

661
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You didn't come since yesterday

662
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You're stupid

663
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm hungry

664
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So

665
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Don't you dare

666
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
To insult my bike

667
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Now feel the consequences

668
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
This is a bike

669
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You can be angry

670
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Feel it

671
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:14,000
For now

672
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You can stay here

673
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
There's no army

674
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Okay

675
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Thank you

676
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's okay

677
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Sir

678
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Where's the man?

679
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Man?

680
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You mean the professor?

681
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Don't be stupid

682
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I know you know a man

683
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Called Panji

684
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
No

685
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We don't know him

686
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We saw him

687
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
He's coming here

688
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Don't be stupid

689
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Shut up

690
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm just asking you to be honest

691
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
If not

692
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You and all your friends

693
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Will be punished severely

694
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Does the professor

695
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Have proof that I'm lying?

696
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Don't lie to me

697
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I know the proof

698
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I know you're drinking Ramuan

699
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
To change your face

700
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And you're changing yourself

701
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
To a dark hero

702
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Right?

703
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So now

704
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm asking you

705
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
To tell me where Panji is

706
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I told you

707
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know him

708
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
He's lying

709
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Shut up

710
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay then

711
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Now I'm going to punish you

712
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And all your friends

713
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Tommy, Mike, Jack

714
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Get them

715
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm sorry

716
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Get them

717
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Don't punish my friends

718
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Punish me

719
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Get them

720
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Your request was late

721
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So now

722
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm going to punish you

723
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Professor is a bad person

724
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Shut up

725
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Because soon

726
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The sun will rise

727
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And you'll be the victims

728
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Get them

729
00:44:46,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Eat it

730
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm Panji

731
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I won't die easily

732
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Because of a coward like you

733
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We can do it

734
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:42,000
If I'm really here

735
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
He won't be able to see

736
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
A tragedy like this

737
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And when he's here

738
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
To help Alfa and his friends

739
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That's when I'll finish him

740
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You're a bad person

741
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You think I'll just stay quiet

742
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And watch everything happen?

743
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Okay

744
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Mufundur Harimau

745
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Why is Harimau back?

746
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
He's angry

747
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Who did this?

748
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Who?

749
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Come with me

750
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Professor's power is not strong enough

751
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Don't you dare insult me

752
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Who did this?

753
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Mufundur Harimau

754
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
He's going to explode

755
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Mufundur Harimau

756
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Mufundur

757
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Mufundur Harimau

758
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Who did this?

759
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Is this your power?

760
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It's not us

761
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's him

762
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Who?

763
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We're enemies

764
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Don't hurt us

765
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Shut up

766
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This is what I'm doing

767
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Come on

768
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Get out

769
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Don't be a coward

770
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Get out

771
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Show your face

772
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Don't be a coward

773
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Get out

774
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
He knows I'm here

775
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
But I'll stay hidden in this cave

776
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'll let him find me

777
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'll do it my way

778
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Get out

779
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Help

780
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,800
And then, suddenly...

781
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:01,740
I get it!

782
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,140
A firefly?

783
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,020
Huh? a firefly?

784
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,600
that... is the firefly

785
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:32,600
[music]

786
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Erik, Fija, we are full and drunk and have enough rest

787
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,600
Now, it's time for us to take action

788
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
Are you ready?

789
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Ready, sir!

790
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Okay, what we will do to attack this giant cactus

791
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
We have to use tactics

792
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:02,600
And the tactics we use is guerilla tactics

793
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,600
What is guerilla tactics, sir?

794
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Guerilla tactics is...

795
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:18,600
One person will go forward fishing as a bait

796
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,600
So that later it will be attacked by the cactus

797
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:27,600
When the cactus attacks, the others are ready to attack and attack

798
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Do you understand?

799
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,600
Yes, sir!

800
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Okay

801
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:39,600
Now, there must be one person who is fishing as a bait

802
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
This is a very dangerous task

803
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,600
Who will be the bait?

804
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
The soldier!

805
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,600
Huh?

806
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,600
Why me?

807
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,600
Oh, mama...

808
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,600
Everyone knows the soldier

809
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
The oldest here is a soldier

810
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
How about that?

811
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,600
And also, Purcha is the fattest, right?

812
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Yes, Purcha

813
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,600
The most flexible, like a buffalo

814
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
I know

815
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Enough, you young people

816
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Your life is hard

817
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Okay, now let's start

818
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Ready, sir!

819
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,600
Now, we attack!

820
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Eric!

821
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:37,600
You're just a little kid

822
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,600
But you're still alive!

823
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,600
I'm Panji

824
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:47,600
It's not easy for me to die in the hands of a trickster like you, Kahra

825
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,600
Zal!

826
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
Panji, you have to win, okay?

827
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
I hope you win

828
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,600
Yes

829
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,600
Panji! Panji!

830
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,600
Come on, Panji!

831
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Come on!

832
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,600
Hey, you didn't pay for my hug!

833
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,600
You hugged us!

834
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
Yes, so I'm the first one to get stung

835
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
I'm the first one to get stung

836
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:25,600
I remind you all

837
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,600
If you lie to me again

838
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,600
I will give you to the family

839
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,600
Yeah!

840
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Yeah, Panji won!

841
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
Yes!

842
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Now, you go there

843
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,600
You free the body and the friends

844
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,600
Hey, Srigala

845
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,600
Don't expect me to obey your will

846
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,600
If that's what you want

847
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Now I will also find the 8th prince

848
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,600
You

849
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Find the 8th prince?

850
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,600
Yes

851
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,600
I'm afraid of being killed

852
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,600
[Laughter]

853
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
What are you laughing at?

854
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,600
I found the 8th prince

855
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,600
To prove that I'm still alive

856
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
So he knows

857
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,600
That his poor fruit child

858
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,600
Has killed him

859
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
Hmm?

860
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,600
You think I don't want to threaten your peanuts?

861
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Okay, if you're not afraid

862
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,600
Now put down your staff

863
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
Or do you regret it?

864
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
Put it down!

865
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,600
If you're not afraid

866
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Now I will also find the 8th prince

867
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:17,600
See you

868
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,600
Wait!

869
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Okay

870
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,600
I will obey your will

871
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Hurry up!

872
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,600
You've been like this for a while

873
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,600
Now hurry

874
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,600
You go there

875
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,600
You free them

876
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,600
Come on

877
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,600
Come on, hurry

878
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,600
[Laughter]

879
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,600
You're a fool

880
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,600
You're afraid of that?

881
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,600
I don't know where the 8th prince is

882
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:19,600
Vivilla!

883
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:26,600
I warn you all

884
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,600
If you lie to me again

885
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,600
I will give you to Barga

886
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
And Barga will eat you

887
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Barga?

888
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Not Barga?

889
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,600
I'm going to destroy you, sir!

890
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
Shut up, you fool!

891
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Enough!

892
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
Follow my order!

893
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,600
Sir!

894
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
Thank you

895
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Now we're free

896
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:56,600
Yes!

897
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,600
We're free!

898
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
The punishment is over

899
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
It's not fun

900
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,600
[Cheering]

901
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:43,600
You missed!

902
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,600
You're a coward!

903
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Come on, attack me

904
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:57,600
You missed!

905
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,600
You're a coward!

906
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,600
Where are you going?

907
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Stop!

908
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:49,600
Eric!

909
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
Are you okay?

910
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
What should we do, soldier?

911
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
I fell down, it hurts so much

912
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Come on, cheer up!

913
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Our job is not done yet

914
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,600
We have to get that cactus flower

915
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:16,600
We got the flower

916
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
You're great!

917
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,600
Good

918
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,600
We did it, Jack!

919
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,600
You're a coward!

920
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,600
Let's run!

921
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
Dad!

922
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:15,600
I miss you so much

923
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,600
You're so kind

924
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,600
You're so kind, Opa

925
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,600
We miss you too

926
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,600
How?

927
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Have you got the cactus flower?

928
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
I'm sorry, Dad

929
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,600
I haven't got the cactus flower yet

930
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:46,600
I heard that I have to burn 12 stones first

931
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:52,600
So the cactus flower can die

932
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,600
Opa

933
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,600
To help us, you don't have to be a murderer

934
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,600
Because to make us aware

935
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,600
You only need a drop of blood of the 8th prince

936
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,600
Only a drop of blood

937
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
A drop of blood?

938
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:18,600
Only a drop of blood of the 8th prince

939
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,600
So that's how it is

940
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:37,600
Rai, Rai, Rai

941
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,600
Wake up, Rai

942
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,600
Wake up

943
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,600
Rai, Rai, Rai

944
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,600
What's wrong, Dad?

945
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,600
Wake up, Rai

946
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,600
What's wrong, Dad?

947
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,600
Wake up, Rai

948
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
What's wrong, Rai?

949
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,600
I don't know

950
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,600
What's wrong, Dad?

951
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Why are you still sleeping?

952
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,600
It's not important what I'm talking about

953
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,600
What's important, Dad?

954
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:08,600
Yes, I'm dreaming about eating delicious food

955
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,600
Until I'm not hungry anymore

956
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,600
I'm sorry to wake you up

957
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,600
But there's something important I want to talk about

958
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,600
What is it, Dad?

959
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,600
What's important?

960
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,600
It's about my parents

961
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,600
Let's go find Mr. Panji

962
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,600
Let's go

963
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,600
Don't go back on your word

964
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,600
What should we do?

965
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:55,600
This is a collection of the remains of the Raksasa cactus

966
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,600
That will heal their wounds

967
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:20,600
Tentara

968
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,600
Why is there no reaction?

969
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,600
It's been a long time

970
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,600
I went to the market to buy some vegetables

971
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,600
Be patient and wait

972
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:47,600
Oh, no

973
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,600
Nik, you're awake

974
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,600
Wake up

975
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,600
(Grunting)

976
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,600
I'm sorry

977
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,600
What did we do?

978
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,600
What's wrong?

979
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,600
You two fainted

980
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,600
You drank too much

981
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,600
Luckily, there's a soldier

982
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,600
He saved you two

983
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,600
He brought you some medicine

984
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,600
Thank you, soldier

985
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,600
Thank you, too

986
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,600
This is a lesson for all of us

987
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,600
As members of the magic school

988
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,600
We have to help each other

989
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,600
Listen up

990
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,600
Make a sound

991
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,600
Then, you can do the magic

992
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,600
The break is over

993
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,600
It's time to continue

994
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
Yes, sir

995
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,600
So, we're going to the army?

996
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,600
Yes, right now

997
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,600
What are you waiting for?

998
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,600
Look, my dear hotel

999
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,600
Not only food and drinks

1000
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,600
He brought lollipop for you four

1001
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,600
We have to respect the hotel

1002
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,600
Respect for the hotel

1003
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,600
Yes, sir

1004
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,600
Wow

1005
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,600
It's new

1006
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,600
Thank you, sir

1007
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,600
This is a new lollipop for you

1008
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,600
Thank you, soldier

1009
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,600
Let's go

1010
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:44,600
Okay

1011
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,600
Ready?

1012
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,600
Ready, soldier

1013
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:54,600
One, two, three

1014
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Break!

1015
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:13,600
That's the place

1016
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,600
I have to get inside

1017
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:23,600
Meteor, fire!

1018
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:38,600
What's that?

1019
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,600
Let's see

1020
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,600
Let's go

1021
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Where is professor Aldemar?

1022
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:04,600
The sorcerer is here

1023
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,600
Catch him!

1024
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,600
Stop!

1025
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:16,600
Where is he?

1026
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
Over there!

1027
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Don't close the door

1028
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,600
What should we do?

1029
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,600
[The sorcerer is here]

1030
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:45,600
The sorcerer's aroma is gone

1031
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
Where is he?

1032
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,600
They can't see

1033
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,600
They can only sense

1034
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,600
That's why I turned into a cat

1035
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,600
So they don't realize

1036
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:12,600
That's what my parents said in my dream

1037
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:17,600
Ufa, are we going to fight the dark?

1038
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,600
Are you kidding?

1039
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,600
You're crazy

1040
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
We're just being chased

1041
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,600
We're already in trouble

1042
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,600
But I don't want to fight

1043
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,600
I just want to take his blood

1044
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,600
What should we do?

1045
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Alfa, what should we do?

1046
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,600
If we want to get the dark's blood

1047
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,600
We have to fight him first

1048
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,600
What should we do?

1049
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
I don't know

1050
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,600
We're just seeing his face

1051
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,600
We don't have to be afraid

1052
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,600
I'm scared

1053
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,600
I think I can get the dark

1054
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,600
That's the person we can trust

1055
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:03,600
The person we can trust?

1056
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,600
It must be Angkara

1057
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,600
That's right!

1058
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,600
I'm going to be Angkara's professor

1059
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,600
That's good

1060
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,600
What's next?

1061
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,600
Are you going to use the magic potion again?

1062
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,600
I think we shouldn't be afraid

1063
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
We should not be reminded

1064
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Angkara's professor has a plan

1065
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,600
He must be aware of us

1066
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,600
That's right

1067
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,600
Have you forgotten?

1068
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,600
We've been taught to change our minds

1069
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,600
We always feel like we're old

1070
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:55,600
We're going to be the new generation

1071
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,600
What's going on?

1072
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,600
Stop!

1073
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,600
The army is here!

1074
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,600
It looks like we're going to be there soon

1075
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,600
Finally, the army is here

1076
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,600
Wait!

1077
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,600
We can't work like that anymore

1078
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,600
The plane is too fast

1079
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,600
It's going to take off

1080
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
Let's use the magic potion

1081
01:10:32,600 --> 01:11:20,600
(Credits)

1082
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Let's make sure

1083
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,660
you
