1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, run with courage

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What are you doing?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Get him!

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're playing with fire?

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The enemy is gone!

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The enemy is gone!

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here, as you requested

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The 8th Prince's footwear

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you, Your Highness

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What is the footwear for?

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's none of your business, Your Highness

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's clear is that you have lost to me

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, you have to follow my orders

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But be careful

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you use that to fight the 8th Prince

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will not stay quiet

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You just calm down, Your Highness

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is not to harm the 8th Prince

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But to harm someone

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Alright, I'll go now

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you, Your Highness

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Goodbye

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is so weird

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's enough

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're a traitor

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Watch your mouth

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your Highness must be very happy with me

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The 8th Prince?

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How dare you betray me?

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You stole my footwear

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
To make a mess, right?

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I can realize

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes, of course

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All of this is because of your orders

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Since when did you become a traitor?

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm a traitor and I bow to you

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're acting weird

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Maybe you're already known to the world

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're drunk

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Drink it!

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sir, why are we here?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because of your stupidity

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You've drunk the love potion from me

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's why you're a traitor

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sir, please forgive me

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry, sir

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You idiot!

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Report, Sir

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How is it?

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Have you arrested the fugitives?

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry, Sir

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Orion and Leon are both innocent

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You idiot!

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Anggar!

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
As a guilty person

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You must arrest Orion and Leon

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And put them back in jail

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hurry!

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Got it!

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Arrest them!

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sir!

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh no

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's so strong

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's Mr. Bargi!

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a rat!

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's a warm tea

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh my God

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Bargi is so big

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
There's a smoke on his hair

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It means there's a soul stone

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But I didn't see it

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I saw that his hair was so curly

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's like it's never been shaved since birth

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because the soldier is not a kid anymore

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's enough

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Dino!

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is it

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's time to take my revenge

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I did it!

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm tired, I can't do it anymore

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Raw cheese is eaten raw

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If Tifinju loses

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We'll use the Kivilat Mantra

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's go!

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Kivilat!

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's just a joke

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's time to get together

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Anji!

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hello everyone

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay everyone

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's do it together

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Using Tavalli Mantra

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is a real monster

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's so big and scary

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've never seen a monster like this

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay everyone

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's do it together

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Using Tavalli Mantra

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
1, 2, 3

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Tavalli!

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We did it!

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why didn't you use Tavalli Mantra earlier?

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We can't hold it anymore

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's eat it!

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No!

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There's only one way

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's run!

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't go!

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm here

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's run!

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't go!

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Run!

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't go!

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Who are you?

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't go!

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's me!

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Who are you?

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hurry!

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We have to get out of here

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Follow me!

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't go!

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm here!

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Follow me!

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Run!

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What are they doing?

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They're so strong

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you everyone

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
For being here

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We'll set up a strategy first

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
After that

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We'll attack again

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Where are you from?

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I've been looking for you

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You better eat first

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So you won't faint again

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I faint?

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How can I faint?

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Earlier, you said you wanted to attack Ankara

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
When you were about to attack Ankara

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You suddenly grabbed me

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It hurt

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And then you fainted

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know why

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll go get the rest

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Listen carefully

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you keep your soul in the soul stone

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And if someone wants to destroy the stone

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You'll feel a terrible pain

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And you won't be able to realize it

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What if someone wants to destroy the stone?

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's why I fainted

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's possible

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Because at that time

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Megantara and the other kids went to destroy the stone

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's enough!

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Eat first, Sir

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Mr. Oret

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Welcome to the school

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm very grateful

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
To you

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
For your hospitality

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because you've freed us from the fire prison

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And we don't know how to repay you

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You don't have to repay anything

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is my responsibility

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Leon is a student in my school

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll help you

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Professor

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've misunderstood you

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Because of the dark side

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've wronged you

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's okay

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We've forgiven you

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Leon

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're so lucky

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
To meet good people

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Like Professor Adebaran and Professor Kulwa

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm so happy

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
By the way

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Where's Professor Agni?

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I want to apologize to him

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Professor Agni is in the dark side

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What?

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why?

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is he possessed?

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Now he's in the dark side

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How come?

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Because of the dark side

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it has affected me

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So he's in the dark side

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Professor

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Agni

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Professor Agni

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's all my fault

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have to be responsible

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll find Professor Agni

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
At the 8th building

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No, Leon

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's dangerous

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, Leon

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's very dangerous

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's a stupid move

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
To come to the dark side

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We have to come up with a strategy

223
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
To face the 8th building

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The 8th building

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Enough

226
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They've destroyed the first soul stone

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We can't give up

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Now

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's time to find the second soul stone

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Where's the second soul stone?

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
According to my research

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The second soul stone

233
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Is controlled by a creature

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Called Bardi

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And now

236
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They're looking for the second soul stone

237
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Looks like we're safe

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
From him

239
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes, Professor

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Why are you and your son

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
In that haunted place?

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What are you doing?

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm looking for you

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And we're looking for Bardi

246
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Wait

247
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There's a doll

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And a paper

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hi, Srigala

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why are you wearing a jacket?

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, it's all because of that feeling

252
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He...

253
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He wants me to marry him

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey, kids

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Don't tease the parents

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
By the way

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Bardi's taste

258
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Is not bad

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't make me feel bad

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He's my uncle's witness

261
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why should we fight with him?

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll just ask him

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And he'll give me the soul stone

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Right

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Wait

266
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You said soul stone?

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, soul stone

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The first soul stone

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Has been obtained by the army

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And we're looking for the second soul stone

271
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The second soul stone

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is from Bardi's hair

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's right

274
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Bardi's hair is a bit smokey

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So we have to cut his hair

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's right

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We're Bardi's hair

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There's no other way

279
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's just meet him

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No, no, no

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't want to meet him

282
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wait

283
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Listen to this

284
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Kura-kura is playing in the yard

285
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Good job

286
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Megantara has a great idea

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What is it?

288
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
How is it?

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Have you succeeded in getting the soul stone?

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I've got it

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I've obtained the soul stone

292
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
From the dark spirit

293
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I've created the spirit

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Where is the spirit?

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Here, professor

296
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What are we waiting for?

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's attack the dark spirit together

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's do it

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The dark spirit is not an easy opponent

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But we can't wait, professor

302
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If we wait, the dark spirit will know our plan

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And it will fail

304
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But if we get caught

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It will be fatal

306
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's okay, professor

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Don't be afraid

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There are many teams of professors

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Especially Orion and Leon

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So we can invite them too

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Orion and Leon?

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Ankara

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
How do you know that Orion and Leon are free?

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've just finished the eighth stage of the dark spirit

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So I know, professor

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Maybe

318
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You've drunk the love potion from the eighth spirit

319
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where have you been?

320
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Vella, Feli

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry

322
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because I've been mean to you

323
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's okay, Rio

324
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We've forgotten

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You're so mean

326
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We're not vengeful

327
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You're right

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm sorry

329
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Actually, my name is Leon

330
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Not Rio

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Mario, Ke

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Moe, Leon

333
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The important thing is you're still happy for us

334
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Right, sister?

335
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You're right, sister

336
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's go to professor Adebaran's room

337
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Ke, who's that?

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I mean, Leon

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes, you're right

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Who's that?

341
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He's my grandfather

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hi, grandpa

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Nice to meet you

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We'll go now

345
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let's go

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's follow him

347
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's go

348
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Uncle

349
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If so

350
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Before we give this potion to him

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I want you to try it first

352
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why should I?

353
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's not for me

354
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why?

355
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Are you afraid?

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is it really a good potion?

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's done

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You don't need to be afraid

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You're not easy to be a fraud

360
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
More than this

361
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You're not easy to be a fraud

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
More than this

363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Uncle

364
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The traitor will never win

365
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What's wrong, Adebaran?

366
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Leon

367
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're a traitor

368
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Leon

369
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Uncle

370
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Let my grandfather go

371
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't move

372
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Do you want to hurt him?

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Don't hurt my grandfather

374
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Stay where you are

375
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If you want him to be safe

376
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Anggara

377
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't take my grandfather, Anggara

378
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Please, Adebaran

379
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Please, save my grandfather

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Leon

381
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Calm down

382
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll bring him back

383
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I feel sick

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Why are you acting like that, Megantara?

385
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Listen, Panci

386
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
To get that soul

387
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What if you...

388
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Marry Barji?

389
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
No, no, no

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I don't want to marry him

391
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't want to

392
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Panci

393
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We have to get that soul stone

394
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If you marry Barji

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
In a marriage

396
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The wife has to obey her husband

397
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When Barji becomes your wife

398
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Barji will obey you

399
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
When you ask for his hair

400
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Barji will happily share it

401
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Share his hair

402
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Right?

403
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
No, no, no

404
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If you want it, I want it

405
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't want to marry that monster

406
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I don't want to

407
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Go to the temple

408
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yes, sir

409
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Think about it

410
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This is just a joke

411
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes, sir

412
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Megantara

413
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is just a joke

414
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's a lie

415
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's true

416
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's a set up

417
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I don't want to marry him

418
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's a set up

419
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Panci

420
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What about the blonde girl?

421
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
How did you know?

422
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I was just asked

423
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
My dream girl

424
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Actually

425
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I want to marry a girl from Putri Angsa

426
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
How can you

427
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Marry a girl from Putri Angsa?

428
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The girl from Angsa

429
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hates men

430
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's true

431
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
In English, it's called impossible

432
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
In Arabic, it's called mustahil

433
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm so stupid

434
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I think you should marry Barji

435
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's just a joke

436
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
No

437
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Listen

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'd rather be single all my life

439
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's not funny

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Guys

441
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't force him

442
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Poor him

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He's gone

444
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I have an idea

445
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What is it?

446
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The 8th prince will be happy with me

447
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Because I got the girl from Putri Angsa

448
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Stop

449
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm Will

450
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm Ferry

451
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We're going to punish you

452
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Help

453
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What are you doing?

454
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Let me go

455
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What are you doing?

456
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What is that?

457
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
This is the dust of protection

458
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Dear dust of protection

459
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Protect this school

460
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
From me

461
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What is that?

462
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This is the dust of protection

463
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Dear dust of protection

464
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Protect this school

465
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
From me

466
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:19,000
What are you doing?

467
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Stop

468
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'll kill you

469
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Here

470
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Ouch

471
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Stop

472
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You're using dust of protection again

473
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I can get you another chance

474
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Watch out

475
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll put it here

476
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This is the right place for you

477
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Stop looking for the dust of soul

478
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We can do this

479
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Leon

480
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Grandpa

481
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Thank God you're awake

482
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Where's Professor Angkara?

483
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He's been expelled from here

484
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
He won't come back

485
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And he won't hurt us again

486
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But I can't just stay here

487
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I have to bring him back

488
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
To make up for my mistake

489
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Thank God

490
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Everything is over now

491
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We're all going to die

492
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't

493
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
This is the real thing

494
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I can do this

495
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Don't leave me

496
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You're still here

497
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That means they don't understand my potential

498
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm going to get you

499
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I have to stop Alfa and Aldebaran from getting the stone

500
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I want to get married

501
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Go

502
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
God

503
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Why did you leave?

504
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I almost got hit by the stone you threw

505
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm sorry God

506
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm leaving

507
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You're so stubborn

508
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You're just like your father

509
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Bargi

510
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm here to tell you

511
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Don't you dare to do anything to anyone

512
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Do you understand?

513
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I understand

514
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And if you do anything to anyone

515
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I will destroy you

516
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And your fate will be the same as Barga's

517
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Okay God

518
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I want to get married

519
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Husband

520
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Okay

521
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The problem with the stone is solved

522
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Now it's time for me to go home

523
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I have to check on Gama and Alvila

524
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Sir

525
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What is it now?

526
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Don't ask me for anything

527
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Because I don't want to

528
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Don't be mad at me

529
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We want to make up with you

530
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Right, Lita?

531
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes, we want to give you a massage

532
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Massage?

533
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes

534
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You were just kidnapped by Bargi

535
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You must be tired

536
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So we want to give you a massage

537
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Do you want to give us a massage?

538
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's good

539
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Do you want to?

540
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes, I do

541
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Let's go

542
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Give me a massage

543
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You're so nice

544
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Is it good?

545
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's good, you're good at giving a massage

546
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
If you want, we can give you a massage everyday

547
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Of course

548
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But there's a condition

549
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What is it?

550
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You have to marry Bargi

551
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
This is it

552
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Just a joke?

553
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
No, I knew it

554
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You're nice to me because you want to

555
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You're so curious

556
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Wait, sir

557
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The massage is not done yet, right?

558
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
No, I don't want to

559
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Do it

560
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But, sir

561
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's not going to work

562
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
How about it?

563
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Is it going to work?

564
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yes, is it going to work?

565
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
No

566
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
No, sir

567
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But, sir, I don't want to marry Bargi

568
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You still don't want to?

569
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes

570
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I have a better idea

571
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What is it?

572
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I have a better idea

573
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay

574
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Let's do it now

575
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Change!

576
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Wow, you're so pretty

577
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But still, you're more beautiful than Bargi

578
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
If this is the way, I want to be a servant

579
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What are you talking about?

580
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'll tell the girl

581
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Hi, everyone

582
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Do I look like Gadis Putri Angsa?

583
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You look exactly like her

584
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm such a cat, why do I have to marry a random girl?

585
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Hi, handsome guy

586
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Why are you here?

587
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm here because I want to meet you

588
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Are you looking for me?

589
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Do you need me?

590
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
For what?

591
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Aren't you the one who hates all men?

592
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yes, I do hate men

593
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But, I'm not a man

594
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes, I do hate men

595
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But, if the men are handsome like you, I want to...

596
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Since I'm far away, do you want to do something for me?

597
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What is it?

598
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Marry Bargi

599
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
What?

600
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Why did Gadis Putri Angsa ask me to marry Bargi?

601
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Does she know Bargi?

602
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's weird

603
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Gadis Putri Angsa can't possibly marry someone like this

604
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Or maybe...

605
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Come on, you want to, right?

606
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Please

607
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Irfan!

608
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Why are you hitting me?

609
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Alfa!

610
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
How dare you lie to me?

611
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Please

612
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm angry

613
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Oh no

614
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
There's a mosquito!

615
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
There's a cockroach!

616
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's a cockroach!

617
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's wet!

618
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
What's wrong, Alfa?

619
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
My plan failed

620
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,000
What are you doing?

621
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
There's sugar!

622
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
There's a mosquito!

623
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There's a cockroach!

624
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You're so noisy!

625
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Calm down, Megantara

626
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm not here to make a fuss

627
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm just reminding you all

628
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Don't bother Bargi

629
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Do you understand?

630
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
[The next day]

631
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Why are we here?

632
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
This is the right place for all of you

633
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Stop looking for the soul stone

634
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm not done yet

635
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
One more time!

636
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What should we do?

637
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You can't do it

638
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You're a coward!

639
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Your body is already injured

640
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You're a coward!

641
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
[The next day]

642
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:27,000
As you all know

643
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Until now

644
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
No one can escape from the aquarium

645
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So, it's better

646
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
To say goodbye to the world

647
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Help!

648
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's a mosquito!

649
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's a cockroach!

650
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:05,000
[We can do it]

651
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Alfa is also in the forest with the cockroach

652
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But, it's okay

653
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Just leave it

654
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I will never be persuaded by them

655
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
To marry a cockroach

656
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Husband!

657
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
[The next day]

658
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Why is it him again?

659
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Husband!

660
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Open it!

661
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Kids, don't be weird

662
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Calm down

663
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Let's focus

664
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Let's destroy it together

665
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Not with the mantra

666
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Let's use the mantra

667
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
"Api Vih"

668
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Wait!

669
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I can't do it!

670
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
How?

671
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Let's try again

672
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
With the mantra "Havancur"

673
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Ready?

674
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
"Havancur"

675
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We can do it!

676
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Let's try again with "Vivinjo"

677
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
"Vivinjo"

678
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's use "Vivinjo"

679
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
"Vivinjo"

680
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
"Api Vih"

681
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
"Havancur"

682
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
"Vivinjo"

683
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We can't do it

684
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Let's use the mantra "Vivinjo"

685
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yes, we can do it

686
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Ready?

687
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Concentrate

688
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
"Vivinjo"

689
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Help!

690
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Don't panic!

691
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm taller than you

692
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Come on!

693
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Get on my back!

694
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
"Vivinjo"

695
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Kids!

696
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Eat the snack

697
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
During the picnic

698
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Help!

699
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You have to calm down

700
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Don't panic

701
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Let's just help him!

702
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes!

703
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
We can't do it

704
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Help!

705
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Don't panic!

706
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Let's just help him!

707
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Husband!

708
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Where is he?

709
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Feel your time

710
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Now

711
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You can't go back

712
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Where is he?

713
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Husband!

714
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Where is he?

715
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Husband!

716
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I know

717
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
This must be Alfa's snake

718
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And his friends

719
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
They must be looking for the snake

720
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Husband?

721
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm in danger

722
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Husband!

723
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The snake!

724
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Husband!

725
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The snake!

726
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Where is he?

727
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Why isn't he coming?

728
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Husband!

729
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He's angry

730
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We can't help him

731
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What should we do?

732
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Husband!

733
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm so happy

734
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I can punish Alfa and Alder

735
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Now

736
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I just need to punish Leon

737
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And his brother

738
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Angara!

739
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Where are you?

740
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
He should be here

741
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And report the result

742
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Angara!

743
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
How dare you come here?

744
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Why?

745
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Because

746
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
He failed to get Orion and Leon

747
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And

748
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
He can't go back to school

749
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Because Aldebaran has spread

750
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The dust around the school

751
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You're so stupid

752
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
He can never be punished

753
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm so happy

754
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I almost fell

755
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's so big

756
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Husband!

757
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
He's so close

758
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Where should I hide?

759
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I have an idea

760
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Okay

761
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Thousand Leaf Daffodil

762
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Perfect

763
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Husband!

764
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Family!

765
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Come here!

766
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Husband's voice

767
00:46:44,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Husband!

768
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Come here!

769
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Husband!

770
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Come here!

771
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Husband!

772
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
The result

773
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Husband!

774
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Argi!

775
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm sorry, Argi

776
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Please, Argi

777
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Husband!

778
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Please, Argi!

779
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
This is the result of the eighth Pangeron

780
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Amazing

781
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Please, make a proposal

782
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
To give it to Argi

783
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So that Argi can realize it

784
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And come back to us

785
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Give it with a smile

786
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Are you ready, Professor?

787
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yes, Professor

788
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Okay, Dr. Bertini?

789
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay

790
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
We'll excuse ourselves, Professor

791
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Excuse me, Professor

792
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Give it with a smile

793
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Okay

794
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Finally

795
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I can be free from that bad feeling

796
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm so happy

797
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:10,000
What's that sound?

798
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Let me check

799
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Help!

800
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Rey! Linda!

801
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Alfa!

802
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Alfa! Li! Linda!

803
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Alfa! I'm sorry, Alfa

804
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Because I thought

805
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
The SOS you sent was just a misunderstanding

806
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Help!

807
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Alfa!

808
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Where are you?

809
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I'm Argi

810
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yes, Argi

811
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You guys stay here

812
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'll go get help

813
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Stay here

814
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:46,000
We'll be fine

815
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm so lazy to meet him again

816
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Daftang Lollipop

817
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Fly, Fang!

818
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Argi!

819
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
My husband!

820
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Don't hug me

821
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You want to get out of here, right?

822
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'll get you out

823
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Argi!

824
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Hold my lollipop

825
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Hold it

826
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Come on

827
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:08,000
What did I tell you?

828
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Don't touch me

829
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's so hard

830
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
To bring a secret with lollipop

831
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
How do I do it?

832
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I know

833
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I have an idea

834
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Big brother

835
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Lollipop

836
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Perfect

837
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Fly, Fang!

838
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Argi!

839
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You go up

840
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Come on

841
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:10,000
My husband!

842
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Okay

843
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm coming

844
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Jump!

845
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Fang!

846
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Hold it

847
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Wake up

848
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I'll go down

849
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Argi!

850
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Hurry!

851
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Destroy the aquarium

852
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm going!

853
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Argi!

854
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Alpha!

855
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Hold on!

856
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Three of you, come here

857
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I want to take a bath

858
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Are you okay?

859
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
We're okay

860
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You're all safe

861
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We're all still alive

862
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Argi!

863
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Thank you

864
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Thank you, Argi!

865
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:24,000
My husband!

866
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
No!

867
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's fun!

868
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Just enjoy it!

869
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
This is fate

870
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Just be happy

871
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Let's go!

872
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm hungry

873
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Argi, you're so weak!

874
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You saved us

875
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Now we're going to be eaten

876
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We're going to be eaten!

877
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The meat is not good

878
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It's so little

879
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
If you want to eat, just eat him

880
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
He's still fresh

881
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Like a goat

882
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
He's a young goat

883
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It's going to be delicious

884
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
What?

885
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You're just a bull

886
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You have more meat

887
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
You're just a bull

888
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Husband!

889
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Eat him!

890
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I love you, Ngen

891
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
What are you doing in there?

892
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It's useless

893
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
If you don't go in there

894
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
The dark side of the building will be mad at me

895
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
What's wrong with you?

896
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Sir!

897
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Why did you go back and forth?

898
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Sir, I'm sorry

899
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I failed to get Orion and Leon

900
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
The goods are very cheap now

901
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
They have put back the dust

902
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So when I got Leon

903
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I was out of breath

904
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I'm sorry, sir

905
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You're useless!

906
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Sir!

907
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Sir, calm down!

908
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Calm down!

909
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You don't have to be patient with me

910
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I know the right punishment for him

911
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
What?

912
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
He's going to be a scourge for a month

913
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
He's forbidden to serve you

914
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Or help you

915
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That way

916
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
He's not considered a human

917
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
He's not useful to you

918
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And he's not considered by Aldebaran

919
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Sir, please don't

920
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
From now on

921
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You're not allowed to serve him for a month

922
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
No!

923
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Sir, please do it

924
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Let me do it

925
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I can't do it

926
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Can you do it?

927
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Yes

928
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
From now on

929
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You're the one who's going to do the task

930
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But you can't disappoint me

931
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Yes, sir

932
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I won't let you disobey my orders

933
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I won't let you

934
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Change your position as a trusted person

935
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Let him go!

936
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Good afternoon, children

937
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Good afternoon, sir

938
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Today we're going to learn

939
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Mantra

940
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yes, sir

941
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
What's wrong?

942
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
What? The teacher? The principal? The passenger?

943
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
They haven't come

944
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's okay

945
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
They've got a special permission

946
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
From Professor Aldebaran

947
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Where are they going, sir?

948
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
How do I know?

949
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
That's why you shouldn't go to the village often

950
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
You'll miss the news

951
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Let me go!

952
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Silence!

953
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Good

954
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Now we're going to learn

955
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Teleportation Mantra

956
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Who can explain what teleportation mantra is?

957
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,000
No one?

958
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
How disappointing

959
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I'm sure you didn't read the book

960
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Good

961
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Teleportation mantra

962
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Is used

963
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
If we want to move from one place

964
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
To another

965
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And it can shorten the distance

966
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And time

967
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I'll give you an example

968
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Teleportation

969
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:41,060
*Music*

970
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,060
What's going on?

971
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,060
I'm here

972
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:59,680
*Music*

973
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,680
Alright, you all have to remember

974
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,680
If you use this mantra

975
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,680
The further you go, the more energy you will get

976
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,680
One more thing, don't misuse this mantra

977
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,680
Because if you do, you won't get to the place you want

978
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,680
Or you will be in trouble

979
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:38,680
*Mantra*

980
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,680
Ahoy, with a smile, professor Aldebaran

981
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,680
The mission is ready

982
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,680
Thank you, professor

983
01:01:48,680 --> 01:02:03,680
*Music*

984
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,680
What are we going to do?

985
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,680
*Singing*

986
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,680
I'm scared

987
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,680
*Singing*

988
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,680
*Music*

989
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,680
What is that bread for?

990
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,680
What are you doing?

991
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,680
*Music*

992
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,680
Alfa, Alfa

993
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,680
Alfa, the sword

994
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,680
*Music*

995
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,680
Alfa is put in the middle of the bread

996
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:56,680
*Music*

997
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,680
Let Alfa go

998
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,680
Alfa

999
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:20,680
*Music*

1000
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,680
Ah

1001
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:30,680
*Music*

1002
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,680
Alfa

1003
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:42,680
*Music*

1004
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,680
No

1005
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,680
Stop, stop

1006
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,680
Don't, don't touch her

1007
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,680
She's our guest

1008
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,680
Yes, that's right, we're guests

1009
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,680
Yes, we're guests

1010
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,680
*Groan*

1011
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,680
Yes, yes

1012
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,680
You want us to get married, right?

1013
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,680
If you want us to get married, don't eat them

1014
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,680
Okay?

1015
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,680
They're all our guests

1016
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,680
They're our wedding guests

1017
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,680
*Coughing*

1018
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:26,680
*Music*

1019
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:32,680
So, you want to marry me?

1020
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,680
Yes, yes, yes

1021
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,680
I want to marry you

1022
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:44,680
So, you love me?

1023
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,680
Okay, okay, that's enough

1024
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,680
The important thing is you can't eat them

1025
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,680
If you eat them, we'll cancel the wedding

1026
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,680
*Laughing*

1027
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,680
Husband

1028
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,680
*Laughing*

1029
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
Guest

1030
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,680
*Groaning*

1031
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,680
Ouch

1032
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,680
Get up, get up

1033
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,680
It's okay, let's go

1034
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,680
Guest

1035
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,680
*Laughing*

1036
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,680
*Music*

1037
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,680
Now, who wants to try this telephone call?

1038
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:30,680
Me, me, me

1039
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,680
Okay

1040
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,680
It seems like everyone wants to try, except for Tom

1041
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,680
Tom

1042
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,680
Tommy, please go to the front

1043
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,680
You get the first turn

1044
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,680
Are you sure, boss? I'm scared

1045
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,680
You're annoying

1046
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,680
Come on, Tommy, go to the front

1047
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,680
Tommy, if you don't want to, you'll get two points

1048
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,680
One

1049
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,680
*Music*

1050
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,680
Stand on my right

1051
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:11,680
I want you to use teleportation and move to my left

1052
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,680
Please

1053
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:20,680
*Music*

1054
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,680
Teleportation

1055
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:44,680
*Music*

1056
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,680
Where is the boss?

1057
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:56,680
*Music*

1058
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,680
Okay, stay where you are

1059
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:05,680
*Music*

1060
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,680
Tommy's turn

1061
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,680
*Music*

1062
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,680
Tommy, where did you get the pee?

1063
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,680
Shut up

1064
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,680
*Music*

1065
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,680
Why did I move to the river?

1066
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1067
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,680
Tommy, I told you not to memorize the dance wrongly

1068
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,680
It's lucky that you moved to the river

1069
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,680
Try it if you want to swim

1070
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,680
You'll get it

1071
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:42,680
*Music*

1072
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:47,680
I didn't expect that I was going to get pee too

1073
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,680
I think the sound of pee is starting to come

1074
01:07:52,680 --> 01:08:01,680
*Music*

1075
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,680
It's so good

1076
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:10,680
Do you know that I'm doing everything for Alfa?

1077
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:17,680
Anyway, I don't want Alfa to be killed by the Dark Lord

1078
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:22,680
Whatever happens, we have to get the Soul Stone

1079
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:27,680
*Music*

1080
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,680
I'm sorry, sir

1081
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,680
I'm sorry for bothering you

1082
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,680
*Music*

1083
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,680
It's okay

1084
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,680
The important thing now, as you said, is to find the soul stone

1085
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:49,680
*Music*

1086
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,680
Wait, wait

1087
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,680
I have an idea

1088
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,680
I don't think Mr. Panji needs to marry Bargi

1089
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,680
You're right, Alfa

1090
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:08,680
Alfa, what are you going to do if Mr. Panji doesn't marry Bargi?

1091
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,680
How can we get the soul stone?

1092
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,680
I don't care if he marries Alfa

1093
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:18,680
But I have a better idea

1094
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:25,680
*Music*

1095
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,680
Your job is to give this love potion to Alfa

1096
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:37,680
It means you have to come to the Panjanggut 8 Palace

1097
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,680
I have another idea, sir

1098
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,680
You shouldn't make your eyes black

1099
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,680
It's not good, sir

1100
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,680
You don't look good

1101
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:53,680
As usual, Alfa

1102
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,680
Yes, sir

1103
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,680
You're the only one who can do it

1104
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:50,680
*Music*
