The prison of fire is very far away

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And whoever goes there, will never return

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Panji, we can't give up yet

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We still have to try to find a way to get Professor Aldebaran out

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Where do you think Professor Aldebaran is?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's a snitch coming here, catch him!

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Catch him!

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The snitch is gone, where is he?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They can't see, they can only sense, that's why I turned into a cat

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't be afraid, don't be fooled

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Professor Ankara has a plan

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He must have been in contact with us

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Have you forgotten? We've been taught to change our souls

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The soul is the key to change the body

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The mantra we're going to learn today is the body changing mantra

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I finda jiwa

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, I think that's a very good idea

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Panji, where's my body?

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Of course, Alfa

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, I'll go first

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Alfa

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Be careful

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We're coming too

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm coming too

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Remember, after Professor Ankara appears, we'll start the action

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think he's not at the door

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why is there someone there?

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The soul is here!

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What?

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Vega, calm down

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's Professor Ankara

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's only gone for a while

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, Alfa has entered Professor Ankara's body?

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, I'm inside now

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's continue our other plans

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, I'll go first

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, please take care of Professor Ankara

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Crazy!

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't be so fast, that's still my body

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My body will get sick

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes, sir

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But, we're going to discuss about that later

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay?

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, Re

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, I'll go now

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay, sir

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
The world's first telecommunication network in Indonesia.

64
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
To the next generation.

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
And the future.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Does romance exist?

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
With "Happy Together".

68
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
But now, "Hopefully Together".

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
"Surely Together".

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,800
"Together, Never Alone".

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes! Now I'm a professor of physics.

72
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
But how do I call the 8th dimension?

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Let's just try it.

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Who knows, maybe the 8th dimension will really come.

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:16,600
It worked! Yes!

76
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
One, two, three, sling, dos, cedar!

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Why are you so excited, Angkara?

78
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,600
No, sir. I'm just warming up, sir.

79
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Yes, yes, yes. That's it, sir.

80
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Oh, yes, sir. Come here, sir.

81
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Come here?

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Yes, sir. I'm in front of you, sir.

83
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
You come here. I have a lot of things to do, Angkara.

84
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I can't go there.

85
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I don't know where the place is.

86
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
If I ask, it must be in the middle of the 8th dimension.

87
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
What is this?

88
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
No, sir.

89
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Sir, I'm now the head of the school.

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
And I have to take care of all the students in the school.

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
All the students will be your followers.

92
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Right, sir?

93
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Okay, sir. Come here, sir.

94
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Be careful on the road, sir. Bye.

95
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Why is Angkara so naughty now?

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
And who is the real master?

97
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Me or Angkara?

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
(The King of Angkara)

99
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I was so nervous.

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I felt like I was going to be kicked out.

101
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm the king now.

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
You just guard the door so no one can come in.

103
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Okay, sir. I'll go out and hide.

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I'll hide inside.

105
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I'll hide.

106
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Here, a girl.

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,600
She's so pretty.

108
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
What should we do?

109
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
If she wakes up, we'll be caught.

110
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Wait.

111
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Oh, right. The TV is on.

112
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
What?

113
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm so hungry.

114
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm almost full.

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm so hungry.

116
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's go inside.

117
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Yes.

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Toilet.

119
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Let's go inside.

120
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Let's go.

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Okay.

122
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Let's go.

123
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
(The King of Angkara)

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:23,600
What's going on here?

125
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Why is it so scary when I come in?

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
(The King of Angkara)

127
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
What's going on?

128
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Sir, you scared me.

129
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Please sit down.

130
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Sir, when did this happen?

131
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Don't talk too much.

132
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
What did you talk to the king?

133
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Look, sir.

134
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm not a spy.

135
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
It's a big story.

136
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I managed to punish Ava.

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
What did you punish her?

138
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Wait, sir.

139
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Good, Angkara.

140
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Taste this.

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:17,600
What are you doing?

142
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Nothing, sir.

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm just relaxing, sir.

144
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
It's good, sir.

145
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It's not that, sir.

146
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Angkara, I still want to see.

147
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
It's okay, sir.

148
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
It's not important.

149
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Let's just finish this.

150
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Sir, I want to discuss something with you.

151
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
What do you want to discuss?

152
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
It's okay.

153
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Let's go.

154
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,600
What's going on?

155
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
A snake!

156
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
It's so close.

157
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Vega, let's go.

158
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Let's go get some food.

159
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay.

160
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Syair!

161
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
It's so close.

162
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Just a little bit more.

163
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
If not, Ava will be angry.

164
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Because her body is burning.

165
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Let's go.

166
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Let's go, sir.

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Let's go.

168
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Sir, before we start,

169
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
please have a drink.

170
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Here, I made a drink, sir.

171
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
What is this, Angkara?

172
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Give this drink to him.

173
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
He will be satisfied.

174
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Here.

175
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
What is that, sir?

176
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I don't know what it is.

177
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
It's coffee, sir.

178
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I know it's Angkara coffee.

179
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
But since when did you drink coffee?

180
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Sir, this is a sign of our success.

181
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
We've punished Alfa.

182
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
And also,

183
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,600
the adults said...

184
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
coffee is a friend of a person who is having an affair.

185
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
A person who is having an affair.

186
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
This is his friend.

187
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Okay.

188
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Thank you.

189
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
You're welcome, sir.

190
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
This is what happened, sir.

191
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Sir.

192
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
This is what happened, sir.

193
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Sir, what's wrong?

194
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Why am I sleepy?

195
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Are you sleepy, sir?

196
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Sir.

197
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
You better go to sleep, sir.

198
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
No.

199
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm a dark wizard.

200
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
If it's just a matter of day,

201
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I can do it.

202
00:13:44,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Yes, I did it.

203
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
What do you think?

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Dark wizard.

205
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
I'll give you some blood.

206
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
It doesn't hurt.

207
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
It feels like...

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm being bitten by a mosquito.

209
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
[The Dark Wizard]

210
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm going to sleep.

211
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Bye.

212
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
[The Dark Wizard]

213
00:14:47,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Rasker Adebaran!

214
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
It looks like...

215
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
we're going to reach our destination soon.

216
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
We're finally here, soldier.

217
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Ready.

218
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
We're landing soon.

219
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Prepare for landing.

220
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Let's go.

221
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
[The Dark Wizard]

222
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Soldier.

223
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Is this the right place?

224
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I don't know, soldier.

225
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
There's no name tag.

226
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm sure.

227
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,600
This is the place we're going to.

228
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
[The Dark Wizard]

229
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:30,600
I think you're not going to sleep here.

230
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
[The Dark Wizard]

231
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,600
What are you doing here?

232
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
My love.

233
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
I'm here...

234
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
if it's my luck.

235
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm not going anywhere.

236
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
I agree with you, soldier.

237
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
The animals here...

238
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
are all beautiful.

239
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Oh, my.

240
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
My body is stiff.

241
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm so refreshed.

242
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I see beautiful animals like this.

243
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
You guys are embarrassing us.

244
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Watch your manners.

245
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Don't be rude.

246
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
When we're with women,

247
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
we shouldn't underestimate ourselves as men.

248
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
You're embarrassing us by flirting.

249
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Watch your mouth.

250
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Let the man ask.

251
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
[The Dark Wizard]

252
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,600
You want to be a man?

253
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
But who's going to be your man?

254
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Excuse me, sir.

255
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I want to ask you something.

256
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,600
What?

257
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Is it true...

258
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
that this village is called...

259
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
the fishing village?

260
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Yes, it's true.

261
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,600
If so,

262
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
allow us to meet...

263
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
your leader.

264
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Let's go.

265
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Where are we going?

266
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
What is this?

267
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
No one's coming.

268
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Guys.

269
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
What's up, sir?

270
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Did you succeed?

271
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Of course.

272
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Look.

273
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I got the Dark Wizard's blood.

274
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Here, Vega.

275
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
You're great, sir.

276
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Let's go to your parents' house.

277
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Let's go.

278
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I'll go first.

279
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
What are we going to do?

280
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh, right.

281
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Sorry, guys.

282
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I forgot that my soul is still in Professor Angkara's body.

283
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Let's go back a little.

284
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Move, soul!

285
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Help me.

286
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Hurry.

287
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Here.

288
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
The door is locked.

289
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Hurry.

290
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,600
(The Dark Wizard's blood)

291
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I'm sleeping here.

292
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
No.

293
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Something's happening.

294
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:29,600
How can I sleep here?

295
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Where's Angkara?

296
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,600
It's useless to have a fruit kid.

297
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
You're not supposed to sleep here.

298
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
You're not allowed to sleep here.

299
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:54,600
What's wrong?

300
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
My finger is hurt.

301
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Who did this?

302
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Why did I sleep outside?

303
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Angkara!

304
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Sir.

305
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Why are you here?

306
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Angkara.

307
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
What did you do when I was eating?

308
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm sorry, sir.

309
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
What do you mean?

310
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Don't lie to me.

311
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
You let me sleep here...

312
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
and you hurt my finger to take my blood.

313
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
The holy blood.

314
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Sir, I really don't understand.

315
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
If it wasn't you, who would dare to take my blood?

316
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Sir, I couldn't do it.

317
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Sir, I'm confused now.

318
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Why did I sleep outside?

319
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Someone must have done this to you.

320
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,600
He hurt my finger to take my blood.

321
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
I won't let this go.

322
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I'll take your blood.

323
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Sir, I'll help you find him.

324
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Shut up, you bastard.

325
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
This is all because of you.

326
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
But, sir... / Shut up!

327
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
You're here because I'm going to give you a hard punishment.

328
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,600
What's going on?

329
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I'm really confused.

330
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
(The King's Palace)

331
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Please come in. The King is waiting for you inside.

332
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Thank you.

333
00:22:44,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Your Highness, there's a traveler looking for you.

334
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

335
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
(The King's Palace)

336
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,600
See, Nik? I told you.

337
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
The people here are beautiful.

338
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Especially the queen.

339
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I swear, I'll die here.

340
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Eda, especially me.

341
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
My eyes are fresh.

342
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
What are you looking for?

343
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Let me introduce you, Your Highness.

344
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
My name is Megantara.

345
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,600
And they are students from the magic school.

346
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Our purpose of coming here is...

347
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,600
to find a stone.

348
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,600
A stone? What stone?

349
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
(The King's Palace)

350
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Nik.

351
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
What's that?

352
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
I don't know, Tengkara.

353
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
But it looks like a stone.

354
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
(The King's Palace)

355
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Tengkara, that's...

356
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
What's that?

357
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
That's the soul of the stone.

358
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,600
What are you doing?

359
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Don't you dare to touch my king.

360
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
(The King's Palace)

361
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Forgive us for our previous plans.

362
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Why are you playing with the stone?

363
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Don't be ridiculous.

364
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
You want to be punished in someone's village?

365
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm not playing with the stone, Tengkara.

366
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm taking the stone.

367
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
What stone?

368
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
You don't know, Megantara?

369
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
The detector is pointing to the stone.

370
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
It means that the stone is inside the queen's chest.

371
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:42,600
What are you talking about?

372
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
What's wrong with my chest?

373
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Your Highness.

374
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
As we have said.

375
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,600
We came here to look for the stone.

376
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
But not just any stone.

377
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,600
We're looking for the soul of the stone.

378
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,600
And...

379
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
It seems...

380
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
The soul of the stone that we're looking for...

381
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,600
The queen is holding it.

382
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
This is my grandmother's legacy.

383
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,600
The legacy of my ancestors.

384
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:35,600
King.

385
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Who dares to take my blood?

386
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Get out!

387
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Kelembu.

388
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Show me who dares to take my blood.

389
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
And where is my blood?

390
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,600
There it is.

391
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,600
That child.

392
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
It's Alfa who dares to take my blood.

393
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Teach him a lesson.

394
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I'll let you do it, Alfa.

395
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I didn't expect that I managed to get the queen's blood in the dark.

396
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,600
I can't wait to see my mom and dad...

397
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Awake from their long sleep.

398
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Dad.

399
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Mom.

400
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Alfa.

401
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
It's not morning yet.

402
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
We're going to wake up early.

403
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Yes, sir.

404
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Let's fly.

405
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,600
What's wrong?

406
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Why are you doing this to yourself?

407
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
What's wrong? -I don't know.

408
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
That's Alfa.

409
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Wait!

410
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Look.

411
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
There!

412
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Aido.

413
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
There's blood!

414
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Wait!

415
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Let's help Alfa.

416
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Let's go.

417
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Wait.

418
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Where are you going?

419
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Wait!

420
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:47,600
I'm tired.

421
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm so tired.

422
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
I'm dizzy.

423
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
I'm tired. -I'm hungry.

424
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
I want to go to the car with gasoline.

425
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Ouch.

426
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:22,600
What's wrong?

427
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
My butt hurts.

428
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Don't fight in this situation.

429
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
One, two, three.

430
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Wait.

431
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,600
What's that?

432
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
What's that? -It's in front of you.

433
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
It's here. -What's that?

434
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
What's that? -There's blood.

435
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Yes.

436
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
It's bleeding. My butt hurts.

437
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
It's bleeding.

438
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
I'm going to the car.

439
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Don't fight.

440
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Don't go.

441
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Hurry up.

442
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:15,600
What's that?

443
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Wait.

444
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
We can't do that anymore.

445
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
It flies so fast.

446
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
It's going to be high.

447
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Let's use a remote control.

448
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Now, it's time...

449
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,600
to draw the blood.

450
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,600
We can do it.

451
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Come on, sir.

452
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I'm coming.

453
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Come on, sir.

454
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Hurry up.

455
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Come on, sir.

456
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Blood!

457
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Come to me!

458
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Come on, sir.

459
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Finally.

460
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
The holy blood is back.

461
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Be patient, sir.

462
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
We'll use another way.

463
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Sir.

464
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Don't give up.

465
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Now,

466
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,600
no one can defeat me.

467
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Or take my holy blood.

468
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Anak Wilian!

469
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Sir.

470
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Eat this chocolate.

471
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Thank you.

472
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,600
I'm not hungry.

473
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:04,600
You haven't eaten for days.

474
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
If you keep doing this,

475
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
you'll get sick.

476
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
I don't care.

477
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm living for free.

478
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,600
If my grandson is taken by the 8th prince.

479
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Even though,

480
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,600
I've been surviving all this time.

481
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,600
For my grandson.

482
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Agni.

483
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Professor Aldebaran.

484
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,600
I finally found you, professor.

485
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
How did you get here?

486
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
It's a long story, professor.

487
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I came here to save you.

488
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Let's go, professor.

489
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
We have to go now.

490
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
That's impossible, Agni.

491
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
I can't leave this place.

492
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Of course you can, professor.

493
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
You can use the magic to turn a seed into a bird, right?

494
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Do it, professor.

495
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Are you sure?

496
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Yes, professor.

497
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
It turns out,

498
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
the guardians are blind.

499
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,600
They can only see through the people around them.

500
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Come on, professor.

501
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
What are we waiting for?

502
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Let's turn the seed into a bird.

503
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
And we'll leave this place right away.

504
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Wait.

505
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Go.

506
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
You have the right to be free.

507
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Go.

508
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Sir.

509
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,600
I can't leave you like this.

510
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,600
If you're worried about me,

511
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
I beg you.

512
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Please save my grandson.

513
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,600
That way, I'll be fine.

514
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
I have high hopes for you.

515
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Please save my grandson.

516
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Where's the seed?

517
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Let's go now.

518
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Before the guardians get here.

519
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Come on.

520
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Go.

521
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Now,

522
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,600
the holy blood has returned to me.

523
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I won't let you come back.

524
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Never again.

525
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm in front of you.

526
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Listen to me.

527
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Leon.

528
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Wake up, Leon.

529
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Wake up.

530
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
What's wrong, sir?

531
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
I'm still sleepy.

532
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
You have to wake up.

533
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Because,

534
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
I know how to set you free.

535
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
And he's waiting for you outside.

536
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,600
He's going to set me free?

537
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Sir.

538
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Leon.

539
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Sir.

540
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
My grandson.

541
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I miss you, Leon.

542
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
I miss you.

543
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,600
You can't get close to your grandpa.

544
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Who are you?

545
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Then, why can't I get close to my grandpa?

546
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Sir.

547
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Sir, please help.

548
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Sir.

549
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Wake up, sir.

550
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Why are you hurting this old man?

551
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Leon.

552
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
You attacked him.

553
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Because he's hurting your grandpa.

554
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
He's hurting you?

555
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
No.

556
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
He's hurting me.

557
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm going to kill you.

558
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
What's wrong?

559
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Wake up, sir.

560
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,600
What happened?

561
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,600
He's just like you.

562
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
So, this is all a lie?

563
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
This is all a trick.

564
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,600
So, your power will increase.

565
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
You're so good.

566
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:07,600
You're evil.

567
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
I'm not the one who's evil.

568
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
But you are.

569
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Because you attacked a human.

570
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,600
I'm going to be your teacher.

571
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,600
You better be careful.

572
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
You better give up.

573
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Because soon...

574
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Your grandfather will be here.

575
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Maybe I'm difficult to change.

576
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,600
But I'm doing this for my grandfather.

577
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Remember, you've done the right thing.

578
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,600
You've done the right thing.

579
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
I'm sorry.

580
00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Finally, I'm free from the fire.

581
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Why did I get angry?

582
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I don't understand what's happening.

583
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Why did I have to do this?

584
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Who's coffee is this?

585
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Or maybe...

586
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
It's the dark wizard's?

587
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:48,600
But how come the dark wizard likes coffee?

588
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
I'll go check.

589
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Angkara!

590
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,600
Wake up!

591
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,600
Useless!

592
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,600
I've been working and you're just sleeping.

593
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Angkara, wake up!

594
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Alright.

595
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
You have to kill me.

596
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
You're dead!

597
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Get up!

598
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,600
Angkara!

599
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
Wake up!

600
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Angkara!

601
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:53,600
Who are you?

602
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Get up.

603
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Follow me.

604
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:07,600
You're so rude to my son.

605
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,600
I told you to walk, but you're still sleeping.

606
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Angkara.

607
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:25,600
This is nothing.

608
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Angkara.

609
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
I'll make you pay for this.

610
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,600
You'll regret this.

611
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
We can't help you.

612
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Get the blood.

613
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,600
Yes, but don't worry.

614
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,600
We'll help you if you need our help.

615
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
It's okay.

616
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
You've tried.

617
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Goodbye, my friends.

618
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,600
That's the dark wizard.

619
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
He's been pulled around Angkara.

620
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
There.

621
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Don't.

622
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,600
He'll be punished if he does it.

623
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
I can feel it.

624
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Professor.

625
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
I can feel it.

626
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
What?

627
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Why are you helping him?

628
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
I don't want to.

629
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
What's wrong with you?

630
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,600
You're so mean to us.

631
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Why are you helping him?

632
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,600
What happened tonight was my fault.

633
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
I wanted to be Angkara's professor.

634
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
It's not his fault.

635
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
I have to help him.

636
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
What are you doing?

637
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
Why are you helping him?

638
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
I don't want to.

639
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
I want to.

640
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
It's okay if you don't want to.

641
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I'll do it.

642
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
Me too.

643
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Why are you helping him?

644
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
He's right.

645
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Angkara's professor is not wrong.

646
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
We have to help him.

647
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,600
Alfa, Lita, let's go.

648
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Don't go.

649
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Let's go.

650
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:14,600
If you come with me,

651
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,600
please save my grandson.

652
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
Please.

653
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
I have high hopes for you.

654
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
That's what I want right now.

655
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Let's go.

656
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Okay, sir.

657
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
I'll...

658
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Hey.

659
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
Why are you so noisy?

660
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Let's go.

661
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,600
It's time for you to go.

662
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
Go.

663
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
I want you to go.

664
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Go.

665
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
It's time for you to go.

666
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:52,600
Let's go, professor.

667
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,600
What are you waiting for?

668
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
[The smell of death]

669
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:14,600
What is this?

670
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,600
It smells like a bird.

671
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
[The smell of death]

672
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:27,600
What is this?

673
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,600
It smells like a cat.

674
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:38,600
Why are these animals...

675
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
...behaving like this?

676
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,600
[The smell of death]

677
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Finally,

678
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
I can be free from the fire.

679
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
Professor, I'm sorry.

680
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,600
We shouldn't have gone to Gabah.

681
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
Gabah?

682
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,600
What do you mean?

683
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
If the professor comes back as a bird,

684
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,600
it's dangerous if our real identity is exposed.

685
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,600
You're right.

686
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,600
Because the fire police...

687
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,600
...can sense and sense our departure.

688
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,600
Come on, Mie.

689
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Get on my back...

690
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
...so our journey is faster and safer.

691
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:31,600
Angkara!

692
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Wake up, Angkara!

693
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
Wake up!

694
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,600
I'll punish you, Angkara.

695
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Did I do something wrong...

696
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
...that I have to be punished?

697
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Sir.

698
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Why are we in the forest?

699
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,600
Why is my hand in the bag?

700
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
Sir!

701
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Sir, what are you doing?

702
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
Sir!

703
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:09,600
Sir.

704
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Why did you throw my bag?

705
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
Shut up!

706
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:22,600
What's wrong?

707
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,600
It hurts.

708
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
You'll die in there.

709
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,600
You'll be eaten by the monsters.

710
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:42,600
Why is he so mean?

711
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
He's the professor of Angkara.

712
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
How could he be punished like that?

713
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,600
That's why...

714
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,600
...we have to help him.

715
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Let him be punished for our mistake.

716
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Then, what should we do?

717
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,600
Let's get closer to the hole...

718
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
...and think of a way.

719
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,600
While the professor is leaving.

720
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
Sir.

721
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,600
I don't have the strength.

722
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
Get away!

723
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Sir.

724
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,600
I don't have the strength.

725
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,600
Get away!

726
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Don't eat me!

727
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
Sir!

728
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,600
Ouch!

729
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,600
What's wrong?

730
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:54,600
The children must be happy to see the professor.

731
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,600
Where are you taking me?

732
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Sir!

733
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:14,600
We can do it.

734
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Why can't the professor see...

735
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,600
...what's going on with them?

736
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
What do you think they're doing?

737
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Okay.

738
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
Tell me.

739
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,600
They're being asked to do something important.

740
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,600
From the professor.

741
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
The professor of Agni.

742
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
I see.

743
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,600
Okay.

744
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Alright.

745
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
You're smiling.

746
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,600
My children.

747
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Since there's no professor of Angkara.

748
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,600
That's why I asked you to go out of the class.

749
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,600
Because I feel...

750
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,600
...so bored in the classroom.

751
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
Because everything is so messy.

752
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,600
It's like we're always...

753
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,600
...at night.

754
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
What do you think, children?

755
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
Right.

756
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,600
We're out of class.

757
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Well.

758
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,600
The professor will teach you...

759
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,600
...a very useful...

760
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
...and useful mantra for you.

761
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
This mantra is called...

762
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
...Bovobovom.

763
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,600
There's a bomb, professor.

764
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Are we going to make a bomb?

765
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Yes, that's right.

766
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
More precisely.

767
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,600
This mantra is useful for creating explosions.

768
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,600
And it can also be used to shock the enemy.

769
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,600
Do you want to?

770
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Yes.

771
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,600
Thank you so much.

772
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,600
Now, I'll show you an example.

773
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,600
My children, pay attention.

774
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Okay.

775
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,600
Pay attention, professor.

776
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,600
Bovobo...

777
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:28,600
What's that, professor?

778
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,600
A bomb, professor.

779
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,600
A bomb, professor?

780
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Yes.

781
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Bomb!

782
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Wow.

783
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:48,600
That's what a titan, professor.

784
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,600
The bomb is used as an explosion controller.

785
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,600
And it can be exploded anytime.

786
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
It can be controlled like a bomb.

787
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,600
Give it a smile.

788
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
Okay? / Yes.

789
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
Now, you go forward.

790
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
Yes.

791
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,600
You just practiced the mantra.

792
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,600
Bovobo...

793
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:32,600
The bomb is back.

794
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,600
You're right.

795
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,600
The professor is right.

796
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
The bomb is back.

797
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:43,600
We've arrived at the school.

798
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,600
Hold on tight.

799
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,600
I'll be right there.

800
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,600
All the children will be happy to see you, professor.

801
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,600
Where are you going, professor?

802
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,600
Bovobo...

803
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Where are my children?

804
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,600
Come on.

805
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,600
Go back to the classroom.

806
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,600
Give it a smile.

807
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,600
I miss you, but don't hit me, professor.

808
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Professor Ranggarbaran.

809
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,600
It's not fun to have professor Ranggarbaran.

810
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,600
I can't be a student of your favorite school anymore.

811
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,600
I'm also happy to be able to go back to school.

812
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,600
And I'm sorry...

813
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,600
for all the things that happened lately.

814
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
But I promise you.

815
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,600
I'll go back to school as always.

816
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Okay.

817
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Let's go.

818
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
We're back to school.

819
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
Yes.

820
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,600
That's enough, children.

821
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Now, professor Aldebaran will go back to work.

822
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
Come on, professor.

823
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Professor Tita, please continue your lesson.

824
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
Thank you, professor Aldebaran.

825
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Give it a smile, children.

826
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,600
Now, we're back to the professor's lesson.

827
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,600
Do you understand?

828
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,600
Now, continue your lesson.

829
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Yes.

830
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,600
Don't forget.

831
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:39,600
Why did you do this to me?

832
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
I'm sorry.

833
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
I didn't mean to.

834
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,600
I'm sorry.

835
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:53,600
You're so slow.

836
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:59,600
I'm so glad that I don't have your strength.

837
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Bang Heran!

838
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,600
Please, Bang Heran!

839
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
Oh, my God!

840
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,600
Bang Heran!

841
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
Bang Heran, I'm begging you!

842
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Bang Heran!

843
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,600
How dare you eat me?

844
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
Watch out.

845
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
I'm a fast learner.

846
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,600
But, he doesn't want to.

847
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,600
Watch out!

848
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
Don't eat me!

849
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,600
You're so slow.

850
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:42,600
You're sick, but you still make me sick.

851
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:48,600
Don't eat me!

852
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,600
Watch out!

853
00:57:50,600 --> 00:58:02,600
The professor is so mean.

854
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,600
He's so mean.

855
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,600
What should we do?

856
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,600
You go and look for the professor.

857
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,600
I'll help you.

858
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,600
You untie the rope.

859
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Okay, Karva.

860
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:32,600
Bang Heran!

861
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:47,600
We're going to the North.

862
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,600
Be careful.

863
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,600
You too.

864
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,600
Come here, you slowpoke!

865
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
Come here, you coward!

866
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
You slowpoke!

867
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,600
Let's go!

868
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,600
We can do it!

869
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Come here, you slowpoke!

870
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
Come here!

871
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Why are you here?

872
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,600
The professor is angry.

873
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
So, I'm here to help.

874
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,600
You can't help me.

875
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
I'm the head of the school.

876
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,600
You stay here.

877
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
So, I can open the door.

878
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
What's wrong with this kid?

879
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,600
He's so arrogant.

880
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,600
You're so mean, professor.

881
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
Just leave him be.

882
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
I'm the head of the school.

883
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
That's weird.

884
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,600
So weird.

885
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,600
Queen Venus said...

886
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,600
that the necklace belongs to her.

887
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,600
It's been more than 1,500 years.

888
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Are you sure?

889
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,600
We're 100% sure.

890
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,600
Yes, sir.

891
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,600
Because I saw a black smoke...

892
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,600
in the soul stone.

893
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,600
You're right, sir.

894
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,600
It's not here.

895
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,600
I didn't see it.

896
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,600
What's wrong with you?

897
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:47,600
You're so arrogant.

898
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,600
You can't see the soldier...

899
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,600
because he's an adult.

900
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,600
He has a lot of sins.

901
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,600
That's why you can't see him.

902
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,600
You're so arrogant.

903
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,600
You said he has a lot of sins.

904
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,600
What's the relation between my sins...

905
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,600
and the stone he's wearing?

906
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,600
You forgot.

907
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,600
The soldier is an adult.

908
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,600
And an adult can't see the soul stone.

909
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
The soul stone can only be seen by children.

910
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
We can't see it.

911
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
But why is it...

912
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,600
why is the shape...

913
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,600
is like that?

914
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,600
The soldier also forgot...

915
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,600
what the professor said.

916
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Remember, Negantara.

917
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,600
Nick, Fija, Eric, and Oktav.

918
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,600
The soul stone...

919
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,600
can't only be seen by adults.

920
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
But it can also be seen in another form.

921
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
For example?

922
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
Usually, the soul stone...

923
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,600
will be sucked into ancient objects.

924
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,600
Antique and very valuable.

925
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,600
And there, it will find a safe house.

926
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
Because the owner...

927
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
will take good care of it.

928
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,600
And will never give it to anyone.

929
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,600
(The soldier is an adult)

930
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:13,600
How is it? Is it true, soldier?

931
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,600
The rainbow is colorful.

932
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
I'm sorry. I forgot.

933
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,600
That's unusual.

934
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,600
Alright then.

935
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,600
We'll act.

936
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,600
And we have to take...

937
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,600
the soul stone from Queen Venus.

938
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Yes, soldier!

939
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,600
(The soldier is an adult)

940
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:45,600
Bring the rainbow to Surabaya.

941
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Dear beautiful queen.

942
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Give me the soul stone.

943
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
Wait.

944
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
Don't be rude to our queen.

945
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,600
You can take our queen's soul stone.

946
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,600
But you have to step on my body first.

947
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,600
How can I step on your body?

948
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
You're not even a body yet.

949
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
Soldier, the rainbow is not dead yet.

950
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Hurry up and bring it back.

951
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Bring it back.

952
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,600
Calm down, Men.

953
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,600
The rainbow weapon...

954
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
hasn't been brought out yet.

955
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:28,600
<i>Kincir-kincir, fly to the clouds.</i>

956
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,600
<i>Don't worry, dear queen who looks like a cloud.</i>

957
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,600
Dear queen.

958
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,600
I won't take the soul stone from the queen.

959
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
But I will buy it.

960
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:56,600
Calm down, Boy.

961
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,600
Bro, just relax.

962
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:09,600
Big burger.

963
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:16,600
What is this?

964
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,600
Nick, Eric.

965
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,600
Please open the box.

966
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,600
The content of this box...

967
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,600
will make the queen happy and the palace full.

968
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:42,600
This is real.

969
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,600
Not fake.

970
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,600
You think we're carrying a fake item?

971
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,600
You call this fake?

972
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,600
Queen.

973
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,600
All of these diamonds and gold...

974
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,600
are the work of a magic school student.

975
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,600
So, I'm sure that it's real.

976
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:17,600
Come here!

977
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:27,600
Men, let's go!

978
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
It's broken!

979
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:58,600
I can do it.

980
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Yes!

981
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:06,600
Let me do it.

982
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,600
Let go, Ali!

983
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,600
The King of the Jungle

984
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:20,600
What did you say?

985
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,600
Thank you? / Shut up!

986
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
I'm the head of this school.

987
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,600
How dare you!

988
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,600
Just say thank you.

989
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,600
I don't want to.

990
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,600
Shut up!

991
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,600
Sir.

992
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
Let's go back to school.

993
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Sir.

994
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
I can do it.

995
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,600
The King of the Jungle

996
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:54,600
I can do it!

997
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,600
Thank you, Frita.

998
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,600
Let's go home.

999
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
Okay.

1000
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,600
Come on, Bro.

1001
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
Shut up!

1002
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
I can do it.

1003
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,600
You're so arrogant.

1004
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
Okay.

1005
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,600
See you later.

1006
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,600
The King of the Jungle

1007
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:42,600
Yes!

1008
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
This is the professor.

1009
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,600
The room.

1010
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
The King of the Jungle

1011
01:07:48,600 --> 01:08:00,600
Yes! I did it!

1012
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:06,600
What are you waiting for?

1013
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
The King of the Jungle

1014
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:25,600
The King of the Jungle?

1015
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,600
Sir.

1016
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,600
So, this is how it is.

1017
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,600
You're in cahoots with all of them.

1018
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
You're a traitor!

1019
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,600
Sir, you're misunderstanding.

1020
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,600
I'm not asking for their help.

1021
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,600
They're the ones who helped me.

1022
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:47,600
I'll destroy the lollipop.

1023
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,600
The lollipop?

1024
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:59,600
What are we going to use it for?

1025
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,600
Sir.

1026
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:07,600
Anghara.

1027
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,600
You've been pretending to be my follower.

1028
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,600
But you're in cahoots with all of them.

1029
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,600
No, sir.

1030
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,600
Sir, don't get me wrong.

1031
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,600
You're wrong.

1032
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,600
This is the proof.

1033
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
You're in cahoots with them.

1034
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,600
I'm going to kill you.

1035
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,600
I'll make you angry.

1036
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,600
You're a traitor.

1037
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
You're so mean.

1038
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,600
Shut up.

1039
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Or maybe you're helping me...

1040
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,600
because you're the ones who are betraying me.

1041
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
Right?

1042
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
Yes.

1043
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
You're so rude.

1044
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,600
You're angry.

1045
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
But you're helping me.

1046
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,600
Thank you.

1047
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,600
What's that?

1048
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,600
He's confused.

1049
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,600
He's so smart.

1050
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,600
Shut up.

1051
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,600
How dare you.

1052
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,600
I'm going to kill you all.

1053
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,600
(The next day)

1054
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:31,600
Wake up.

1055
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,600
Get out of my way.

1056
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,600
I was killed in the middle of the night.

1057
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,600
It's okay. I'm dead.

1058
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,600
How can a person be dead?

1059
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
I don't know.

1060
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
Because this school is a mantra school.

1061
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,600
So, the evil spirit can't enter.

1062
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,600
Shut up.

1063
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,600
Who's the evil spirit?

1064
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
It's me.

1065
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:17,600
(Preview of the next episode)

1066
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:32,600
