00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 To be continued...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 To be continued...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 To be continued...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 To be continued...

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 To be continued...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, run with courage

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 The prison of fire is very far away

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And whoever goes there, will never return

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Panji, we can't give up yet

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We still have to try to find a way to get Professor Aldebaran out

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Where do you think Professor Aldebaran is?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 There's a snitch coming here, catch him!

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Catch him!

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 The snitch is gone, where is he?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 They can't see, they can only sense, that's why I turned into a cat

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Don't be afraid, don't be fooled

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Professor Ankara has a plan

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 He must have been in contact with us

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Have you forgotten? We've been taught to change our souls

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 The soul is the key to change the body

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 The soul is the key to change the body

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 The soul is the key to change the body

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 The mantra we're going to learn today is the body changing mantra

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I finda jiwa

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Yes, I think that's a very good idea

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Panji, where's my body?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Of course, Alva

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Here

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Okay, I'll go first

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Alva

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Be careful

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 We're coming too

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I'm coming too

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I'm coming too

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Remember, after Professor Ankara appears, we'll start the action

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Okay

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Okay

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I think he's not at the door

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Why is there someone there?

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 The soul is here!

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 The soul is here!

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 What?

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Vega, calm down

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 That's Professor Ankara

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 He's only gone for a while

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So, Alva has entered Professor Ankara's body?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Yes, I'm inside now

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Let's continue our other plans

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Okay, I'll go first

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Now, please take care of Professor Ankara

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Okay

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Crazy!

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Don't be so fast, that's still my body

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 My body will get sick

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Yes, sir

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Yes, sir

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 But, we're going to discuss about that later

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Okay?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Yes, Re

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Okay, I'll go now

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Okay, sir

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
 The world's first telecommunication network in Indonesia.

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 To the next generation.

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 And the future.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 Does romance exist?

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 With "Happy Together".

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 But now, "Hopefully Together".

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
 "Surely Together".

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,800
 "Together, Never Alone".

81
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
 Yes! Now I'm a professor of physics.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 But how do I call the 8th dimension?

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600
 Let's just try it.

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 Who knows, maybe the 8th dimension will really come.

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:12,600
 It worked! Yes!

86
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
 It worked! Yes!

87
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 One, two, three, sling, dos, cedar!

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 Why are you so excited, Angkara?

89
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,600
 No, sir. I'm just warming up, sir.

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
 Yes, yes, yes. That's it, sir.

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 Oh, yes, sir. Come here, sir.

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
 Come here?

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 Yes, sir. I'm in front of you, sir.

94
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
 You come here. I have a lot of things to do, Angkara.

95
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 I can't go there.

96
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
 I don't know where the place is.

97
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
 If I ask, it must be in the middle of the 8th dimension.

98
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 What is this?

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
 No, sir.

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 Sir, I'm now the head of the school.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
 And I have to take care of all the students in the school.

102
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
 All the students will be your followers.

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
 Right, sir?

104
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 Okay, sir. Come here, sir.

105
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 Be careful on the road, sir. Bye.

106
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,600
 Why is Angkara so naughty now?

107
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
 And who is the real master?

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 Me or Angkara?

109
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 (The King of Angkara)

110
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:51,600
 I was so nervous.

111
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 I felt like I was going to be kicked out.

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
 I'm the king now.

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
 You just guard the door so no one can come in.

114
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
 Okay, sir. I'll go out and hide.

115
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 I'll hide inside.

116
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
 I'll hide.

117
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 Here, a girl.

118
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,600
 She's so pretty.

119
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
 What should we do?

120
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
 If she wakes up, we'll be caught.

121
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
 Wait.

122
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
 Oh, right. The TV is on.

123
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 What?

124
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 I'm so hungry.

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 I'm almost full.

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 I'm so hungry.

127
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 Let's go inside.

128
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 Yes.

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
 Toilet.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
 Let's go inside.

131
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
 Let's go.

132
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
 Okay.

133
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 Let's go.

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 (The King of Angkara)

135
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 What's going on here?

136
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 Why is it so scary when I come in?

137
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
 (The King of Angkara)

138
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
 What's going on?

139
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
 Sir, you scared me.

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 Please sit down.

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
 Sir, when did this happen?

142
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 Don't talk too much.

143
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
 What did you talk to the king?

144
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
 Look, sir.

145
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 I'm not a spy.

146
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 It's a big story.

147
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 I managed to punish Ava.

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
 What did you punish her?

149
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 Wait, sir.

150
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 Good, Angkara.

151
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 Taste this.

152
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 What are you doing?

153
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 Nothing, sir.

154
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 I'm just relaxing, sir.

155
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 It's good, sir.

156
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
 It's not that, sir.

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:39,600
 Angkara, I still want to see.

158
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
 It's okay, sir.

159
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 It's not important.

160
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 Let's just finish this.

161
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 Sir, I want to discuss something with you.

162
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
 What do you want to discuss?

163
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 It's okay.

164
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 Let's go.

165
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,600
 What's going on?

166
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
 A snake!

167
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
 It's so close.

168
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
 Vega, let's go.

169
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 Let's go get some food.

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
 Okay.

171
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 Syair!

172
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 It's so close.

173
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 Just a little bit more.

174
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 If not, Ava will be angry.

175
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
 Because her body is burning.

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
 Let's go.

177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 Let's go.

178
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 Let's go, sir.

179
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
 Let's go.

180
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 Sir, before we start,

181
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
 please have a drink.

182
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
 Here, I made a drink, sir.

183
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 What is this, Angkara?

184
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
 Give this drink to him.

185
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
 He will be satisfied.

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
 Here.

187
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
 What is that, sir?

188
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 I don't know what it is.

189
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 It's coffee, sir.

190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
 I know it's Angkara coffee.

191
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 But since when did you drink coffee?

192
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 Sir, this is a sign of our success.

193
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 We've punished Alva.

194
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 And also,

195
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 the adults said...

196
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 the adults said...

197
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
 coffee is a friend of a person who is having an affair.

198
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 A person who is having an affair.

199
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
 This is his friend.

200
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 Okay.

201
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
 Thank you.

202
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 You're welcome, sir.

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
 This is what happened, sir.

204
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,600
 Sir.

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
 This is what happened, sir.

206
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 Sir, what's wrong?

207
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,600
 Why am I sleepy?

208
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Are you sleepy, sir?

209
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 Sir.

210
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
 You better go to sleep, sir.

211
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 No.

212
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 I'm a dark wizard.

213
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 If it's just a matter of day,

214
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 I can do it.

215
00:13:44,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 Yes, I did it.

216
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 What do you think?

217
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,600
 Dark wizard.

218
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 I'll give you some blood.

219
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
 It doesn't hurt.

220
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
 It feels like...

221
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 I'm being bitten by a mosquito.

222
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 [The Dark Wizard]

223
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:42,600
 I'm going to sleep.

224
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
 Bye.

225
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 [The Dark Wizard]

226
00:14:47,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 Rasker Adebaran!

227
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
 It looks like...

228
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
 we're going to reach our destination soon.

229
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
 We're finally here, soldier.

230
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
 Ready.

231
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
 We're landing soon.

232
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
 Prepare for landing.

233
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:38,600
 Let's go.

234
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
 [The Dark Wizard]

235
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:53,600
 Soldier.

236
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
 Is this the right place?

237
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
 I don't know, soldier.

238
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 There's no name tag.

239
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 I'm sure.

240
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,600
 This is the place we're going to.

241
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 [The Dark Wizard]

242
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 I think you're not going to sleep here.

243
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
 [The Dark Wizard]

244
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,600
 What are you doing here?

245
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 My love.

246
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 I'm here...

247
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 if it's my luck.

248
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 I'm not going anywhere.

249
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 I agree with you, soldier.

250
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
 The animals here...

251
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 are all beautiful.

252
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
 Oh, my.

253
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 My body is stiff.

254
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
 I'm so refreshed.

255
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,600
 I see beautiful animals like this.

256
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
 You guys are embarrassing us.

257
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 Watch your manners.

258
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
 Don't be rude.

259
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
 When we're with women,

260
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
 we shouldn't underestimate ourselves as men.

261
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 You're embarrassing us by flirting.

262
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 Watch your mouth.

263
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
 Let the man ask.

264
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
 [The Dark Wizard]

265
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,600
 You want to be a man?

266
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 But who's going to be your man?

267
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
 Excuse me, sir.

268
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 I want to ask you something.

269
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
 What?

270
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 What?

271
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
 What?

272
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
 Is it true...

273
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
 that this village is called...

274
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
 the fishing village?

275
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
 Yes, it's true.

276
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,600
 If so,

277
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
 allow us to meet...

278
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 your leader.

279
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
 Let's go.

280
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:22,600
 Where are we going?

281
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
 What is this?

282
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 No one's coming.

283
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
 Guys.

284
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 What's up, sir?

285
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
 Did you succeed?

286
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
 Of course.

287
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
 Look.

288
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
 I got the Dark Wizard's blood.

289
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 Here, Vega.

290
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 You're great, sir.

291
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 Let's go to your parents' house.

292
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
 Let's go.

293
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
 I'll go first.

294
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
 What are we going to do?

295
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
 Oh, right.

296
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
 Sorry, guys.

297
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,600
 I forgot that my soul is still in Professor Angkara's body.

298
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
 Let's go back a little.

299
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 Move, soul!

300
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 Help me.

301
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
 Hurry.

302
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 Here.

303
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 The door is locked.

304
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 Hurry.

305
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 (The Dark Wizard's blood)

306
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 (The Dark Wizard's blood)

307
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 (The Dark Wizard's blood)

308
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
 I'm sleeping here.

309
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
 No.

310
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 Something's happening.

311
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:29,600
 How can I sleep here?

312
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 Where's Angkara?

313
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 It's useless to have a fruit kid.

314
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
 You're not supposed to sleep here.

315
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
 You're not allowed to sleep here.

316
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:54,600
 What's wrong?

317
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 My finger is hurt.

318
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 Who did this?

319
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 Why did I sleep outside?

320
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 Angkara!

321
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
 Sir.

322
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 Why are you here?

323
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 Angkara.

324
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 What did you do when I was eating?

325
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
 I'm sorry, sir.

326
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 What do you mean?

327
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
 Don't lie to me.

328
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 You let me sleep here...

329
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 and you hurt my finger to take my blood.

330
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 The holy blood.

331
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 Sir, I really don't understand.

332
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
 If it wasn't you, who would dare to take my blood?

333
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
 Sir, I couldn't do it.

334
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,600
 Sir, I'm confused now.

335
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 Why did I sleep outside?

336
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 Someone must have done this to you.

337
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 He hurt my finger to take my blood.

338
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 I won't let this go.

339
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 I'll take your blood.

340
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
 Sir, I'll help you find him.

341
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 Shut up, you bastard.

342
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 This is all because of you.

343
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
 But, sir... / Shut up!

344
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 You're here because I'm going to give you a hard punishment.

345
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,600
 What's going on?

346
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
 I'm really confused.

347
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
 (The King's Palace)

348
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 Please come in. The King is waiting for you inside.

349
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
 Thank you.

350
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 Thank you.

351
00:22:44,600 --> 00:23:05,600
 Your Highness, there's a traveler looking for you.

352
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 Greetings, Your Highness.

353

 (The King's Palace)

354
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,600
 See, Nik? I told you.

355
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
 The people here are beautiful.

356
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 Especially the queen.

357
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,600
 I swear, I'll die here.

358
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
 Eda, especially me.

359
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
 My eyes are fresh.

360
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 What are you looking for?

361
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
 Let me introduce you, Your Highness.

362
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
 My name is Megantara.

363
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,600
 And they are students from the magic school.

364
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 Our purpose of coming here is...

365
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 to find a stone.

366
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 A stone? What stone?

367
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
 (The King's Palace)

368
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:19,600
 Nik.

369
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
 What's that?

370
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
 I don't know, Tengkara.

371
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
 But it looks like a stone.

372
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 (The King's Palace)

373
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,600
 Tengkara, that's...

374
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 What's that?

375
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 That's the soul of the stone.

376
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,600
 What are you doing?

377
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 Don't you dare to touch my king.

378
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
 (The King's Palace)

379
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 Forgive us for our previous plans.

380
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,600
 Why are you playing with the stone?

381
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
 Don't be ridiculous.

382
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
 You want to be punished in someone's village?

383
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
 I'm not playing with the stone, Tengkara.

384
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
 I'm taking the stone.

385
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 What stone?

386
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 You don't know, Megantara?

387
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
 The detector is pointing to the stone.

388
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 It means that the stone is inside the queen's chest.

389
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:42,600
 What are you talking about?

390
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
 What's wrong with my chest?

391
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 Your Highness.

392
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 As we have said.

393
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,600
 We came here to look for the stone.

394
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 But not just any stone.

395
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,600
 We're looking for the soul of the stone.

396
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,600
 And...

397
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 It seems...

398
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
 The soul of the stone that we're looking for...

399
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,600
 The queen is holding it.

400
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
 This is my grandmother's legacy.

401
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 The legacy of my ancestors.

402
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 King.

403
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 Who dares to take my blood?

404
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,600
 Get out!

405
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
 Get out!

406
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 Kelembu.

407
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,600
 Show me who dares to take my blood.

408
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
 And where is my blood?

409
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,600
 There it is.

410
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,600
 That child.

411
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
 It's Alva who dares to take my blood.

412
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
 Teach him a lesson.

413
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
 I'll let you do it, Alva.

414
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,600
 I didn't expect that I managed to get the queen's blood in the dark.

415
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,600
 I can't wait to see my mom and dad...

416
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,600
 Awake from their long sleep.

417
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,600
 To be continued...

418
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,600
 To be continued...

419
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:56,600
 Dad.

420
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
 Mom.

421
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 Alva.

422
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 Alva.

423
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
 It's not morning yet.

424
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
 We're going to wake up early.

425
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
 Yes, sir.

426
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 Let's fly.

427
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
 To be continued...

428
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
 What's wrong?

429
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 What's wrong?

430
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,600
 Why are you doing this to yourself?

431
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
 What's wrong? -I don't know.

432
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 That's Alva.

433
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
 Wait!

434
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,600
 Look.

435
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 There!

436
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
 Aido.

437
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
 There's blood!

438
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 Wait!

439
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
 Let's help Alva.

440
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 Let's go.

441
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
 Wait.

442
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
 Where are you going?

443
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:34,600
 Wait!

444
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:47,600
 I'm tired.

445
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
 I'm so tired.

446
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 I'm dizzy.

447
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
 I'm tired. -I'm hungry.

448
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
 I want to go to the car with gasoline.

449
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
 Ouch.

450
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:22,600
 What's wrong?

451
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 My butt hurts.

452
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 Don't fight in this situation.

453
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
 One, two, three.

454
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,600
 Wait.

455
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,600
 What's that?

456
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
 What's that? -It's in front of you.

457
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 It's here. -What's that?

458
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 What's that? -There's blood.

459
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 Yes.

460
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
 It's bleeding. My butt hurts.

461
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 It's bleeding.

462
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
 I'm going to the car.

463
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 Don't fight.

464
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
 Don't go.

465
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
 Don't go.

466
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
 Hurry up.

467
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:15,600
 What's that?

468
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
 Wait.

469
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 We can't do that anymore.

470
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
 It flies so fast.

471
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
 It's going to be high.

472
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
 Let's use a remote control.

473
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:45,600
 Now, it's time...

474
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 to draw the blood.

475
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 To be continued...

476
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,600
 To be continued...

477
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 To be continued...

478
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 To be continued...

479
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 We can do it.

480
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,600
 Come on, sir.

481
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
 I'm coming.

482
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,600
 Come on, sir.

483
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
 Hurry up.

484
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
 Come on, sir.

485
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
 Come on, sir.

486
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,600
 To be continued...

487
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:42,600
 Blood!

488
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
 Come to me!

489
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 Come on, sir.

490
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
 Come on, sir.

491
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,600
 To be continued...

492
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,600
 To be continued...

493
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,600
 To be continued...

494
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,600
 To be continued...

495
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:40,600
 Finally.

496
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
 The holy blood is back.

497
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 To be continued...

498
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,600
 Be patient, sir.

499
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
 We'll use another way.

500
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
 Sir.

501
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
 Don't give up.

502
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,600
 Now,

503
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,600
 no one can defeat me.

504
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 Or take my holy blood.

505
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
 Or take my holy blood.

506
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
 Anak Wilian!

507
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 Anak Wilian!

508
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
 Anak Wilian!

509
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
 Sir.

510
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
 Eat this chocolate.

511
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
 Thank you.

512
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 I'm not hungry.

513
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:04,600
 You haven't eaten for days.

514
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
 If you keep doing this,

515
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 you'll get sick.

516
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
 I don't care.

517
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
 I'm living for free.

518
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,600
 If my grandson is taken by the 8th prince.

519
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
 Even though,

520
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,600
 I've been surviving all this time.

521
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,600
 For my grandson.

522
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:38,600
 Agni.

523
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
 Professor Aldebaran.

524
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,600
 I finally found you, professor.

525
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
 How did you get here?

526
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
 It's a long story, professor.

527
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
 I came here to save you.

528
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
 Let's go, professor.

529
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
 We have to go now.

530
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
 That's impossible, Agni.

531
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
 I can't leave this place.

532
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
 Of course you can, professor.

533
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
 You can use the magic to turn a seed into a bird, right?

534
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
 Do it, professor.

535
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,600
 Are you sure?

536
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
 Yes, professor.

537
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
 It turns out,

538
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
 the guardians are blind.

539
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,600
 They can only see through the people around them.

540
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 Come on, professor.

541
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
 What are we waiting for?

542
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
 Let's turn the seed into a bird.

543
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
 And we'll leave this place right away.

544
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
 Wait.

545
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,600
 Go.

546
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
 You have the right to be free.

547
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
 Go.

548
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
 Sir.

549
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,600
 I can't leave you like this.

550
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,600
 If you're worried about me,

551
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
 I beg you.

552
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 Please save my grandson.

553
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,600
 That way, I'll be fine.

554
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
 I have high hopes for you.

555
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
 Please save my grandson.

556
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
 Where's the seed?

557
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,600
 Let's go now.

558
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
 Before the guardians get here.

559
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
 Come on.

560
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
 Go.

561
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:29,600
 Now,

562
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,600
 the holy blood has returned to me.

563
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
 I won't let you come back.

564
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
 Never again.

565
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 I'm in front of you.

566
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
 Listen to me.

567
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:21,600
 Leon.

568
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
 Wake up, Leon.

569
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
 Wake up.

570
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
 What's wrong, sir?

571
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
 I'm still sleepy.

572
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 You have to wake up.

573
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 Because,

574
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
 I know how to set you free.

575
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
 And he's waiting for you outside.

576
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,600
 He's going to set me free?

577
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,600
 Sir.

578
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,600
 Sir.

579
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,600
 Leon.

580
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
 Sir.

581
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
 My grandson.

582
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
 I miss you, Leon.

583
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
 I miss you.

584
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,600
 You can't get close to your grandpa.

585
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
 Who are you?

586
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
 Then, why can't I get close to my grandpa?

587
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,600
 Sir.

588
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
 Sir.

589
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
 Sir, please help.

590
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
 Sir.

591
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
 Sir.

592
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,600
 Wake up, sir.

593
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
 Wake up, sir.

594
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
 Wake up, sir.

595
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
 Wake up, sir.

596
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
 Wake up, sir.

597
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 Why are you hurting this old man?

598
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
 Leon.

599
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
 You attacked him.

600
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,600
 Because he's hurting your grandpa.

601
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
 He's hurting you?

602
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
 No.

603
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
 He's hurting me.

604
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
 I'm going to kill you.

605
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
 I'm going to kill you.

606
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
 I'm going to kill you.

607
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
 I'm going to kill you.

608
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
 I'm going to kill you.

609
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
 I'm going to kill you.

610
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
 I'm going to kill you.

611
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
 I'm going to kill you.

612
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
 I'm going to kill you.

613
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,600
 I'm going to kill you.

614
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
 I'm going to kill you.

615
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
 What's wrong?

616
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
 Wake up, sir.

617
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
 Wake up, sir.

618
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,600
 Wake up, sir.

619
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
 Wake up, sir.

620
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,600
 What happened?

621
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,600
 He's just like you.

622
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
 So, this is all a lie?

623
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
 This is all a trick.

624
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,600
 So, your power will increase.

625
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
 You're so good.

626
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:07,600
 You're evil.

627
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
 I'm not the one who's evil.

628
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
 But you are.

629
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
 Because you attacked a human.

630
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,600
 I'm going to be your teacher.

631
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,600
 You better be careful.

632
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
 You better give up.

633
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,600
 Because soon...

634
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
 Your grandfather will be here.

635
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:39,600
 Maybe I'm difficult to change.

636
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,600
 But I'm doing this for my grandfather.

637
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,600
 Remember, you've done the right thing.

638
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,600
 You've done the right thing.

639
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
 I'm sorry.

640
00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:00,600
 Finally, I'm free from the fire.

641
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:19,600
 Why did I get angry?

642
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
 I don't understand what's happening.

643
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
 Why did I have to do this?

644
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:35,600
 Who's coffee is this?

645
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,600
 Or maybe...

646
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
 It's the dark wizard's?

647
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:48,600
 But how come the dark wizard likes coffee?

648
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
 I'll go check.

649
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
 Angkara!

650
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,600
 Wake up!

651
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,600
 Useless!

652
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,600
 I've been working and you're just sleeping.

653
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
 Angkara, wake up!

654
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,600
 Alright.

655
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,600
 You have to kill me.

656
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
 You're dead!

657
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
 Get up!

658
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,600
 Angkara!

659
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
 Wake up!

660
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
 Angkara!

661
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:53,600
 Who are you?

662
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,600
 Get up.

663
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
 Follow me.

664
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:07,600
 You're so rude to my son.

665
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,600
 I told you to walk, but you're still sleeping.

666
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
 Angkara.

667
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:25,600
 This is nothing.

668
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
 Angkara.

669
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
 I'll make you pay for this.

670
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,600
 You'll regret this.

671
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
 We can't help you.

672
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
 Get the blood.

673
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,600
 Yes, but don't worry.

674
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,600
 We'll help you if you need our help.

675
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
 It's okay.

676
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
 You've tried.

677
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
 Goodbye, my friends.

678
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,600
 That's the dark wizard.

679
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
 He's been pulled around Angkara.

680
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
 There.

681
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
 Don't.

682
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,600
 He'll be punished if he does it.

683
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
 I can feel it.

684
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
 Professor.

685
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
 I can feel it.

686
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
 What?

687
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
 Why are you helping him?

688
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
 I don't want to.

689
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
 What's wrong with you?

690
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,600
 You're so mean to us.

691
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
 Why are you helping him?

692
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,600
 What happened tonight was my fault.

693
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
 I wanted to be Angkara's professor.

694
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
 It's not his fault.

695
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
 I have to help him.

696
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
 What are you doing?

697
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
 Why are you helping him?

698
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
 I don't want to.

699
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
 I want to.

700
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
 It's okay if you don't want to.

701
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
 I'll do it.

702
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
 Me too.

703
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,600
 Why are you helping him?

704
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
 He's right.

705
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
 Angkara's professor is not wrong.

706
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
 We have to help him.

707
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,600
 Alva, Lita, let's go.

708
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
 Don't go.

709
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
 Let's go.

710
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:14,600
 If you come with me,

711
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,600
 please save my grandson.

712
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
 Please.

713
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
 I have high hopes for you.

714
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
 That's what I want right now.

715
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
 Let's go.

716
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
 Okay, sir.

717
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
 I'll...

718
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
 Hey.

719
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
 Why are you so noisy?

720
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
 Let's go.

721
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,600
 It's time for you to go.

722
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
 Go.

723
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
 I want you to go.

724
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
 Go.

725
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
 It's time for you to go.

726
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:52,600
 Let's go, professor.

727
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,600
 What are you waiting for?

728
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
 [The smell of death]

729
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:14,600
 What is this?

730
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,600
 It smells like a bird.

731
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
 [The smell of death]

732
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:27,600
 What is this?

733
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,600
 It smells like a cat.

734
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:38,600
 Why are these animals...

735
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
 ...behaving like this?

736
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,600
 [The smell of death]

737
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:50,600
 Finally,

738
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
 I can be free from the fire.

739
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
 Professor, I'm sorry.

740
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,600
 We shouldn't have gone to Gabah.

741
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
 Gabah?

742
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,600
 What do you mean?

743
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
 If the professor comes back as a bird,

744
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,600
 it's dangerous if our real identity is exposed.

745
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,600
 You're right.

746
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,600
 Because the fire police...

747
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,600
 ...can sense and sense our departure.

748
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,600
 Come on, Mie.

749
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
 Get on my back...

750
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
 ...so our journey is faster and safer.

751
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:31,600
 Angkara!

752
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
 Wake up, Angkara!

753
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
 Wake up!

754
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,600
 I'll punish you, Angkara.

755
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
 Did I do something wrong...

756
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
 ...that I have to be punished?

757
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,600
 Sir.

758
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
 Why are we in the forest?

759
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,600
 Why is my hand in the bag?

760
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
 Sir!

761
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
 Sir, what are you doing?

762
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
 Sir!

763
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:09,600
 Sir.

764
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,600
 Why did you throw my bag?

765
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
 Shut up!

766
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:22,600
 What's wrong?

767
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,600
 It hurts.

768
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
 You'll die in there.

769
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,600
 You'll be eaten by the monsters.

770
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:42,600
 Why is he so mean?

771
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
 He's the professor of Angkara.

772
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
 How could he be punished like that?

773
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,600
 That's why...

774
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,600
 ...we have to help him.

775
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,600
 Let him be punished for our mistake.

776
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,600
 Then, what should we do?

777
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,600
 Let's get closer to the hole...

778
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
 ...and think of a way.

779
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,600
 While the professor is leaving.

780
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
 Sir.

781
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,600
 I don't have the strength.

782
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
 Get away!

783
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
 Sir.

784
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:31,600
 Sir.

785
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,600
 I don't have the strength.

786
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,600
 Get away!

787
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,600
 Don't eat me!

788
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
 Sir!

789
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,600
 Ouch!

790
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,600
 What's wrong?

791
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:54,600
 The children must be happy to see the professor.

792
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,600
 Where are you taking me?

793
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
 Sir!

794
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,600
 We can do it.

795
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:14,600
 We can do it.

796
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
 Why can't the professor see...

797
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,600
 ...what's going on with them?

798
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
 What do you think they're doing?

799
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
 Okay.

800
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
 Tell me.

801
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,600
 They're being asked to do something important.

802
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,600
 From the professor.

803
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
 The professor of Agni.

804
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
 I see.

805
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,600
 Okay.

806
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,600
 Alright.

807
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
 You're smiling.

808
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,600
 My children.

809
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,600
 Since there's no professor of Angkara.

810
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,600
 That's why I asked you to go out of the class.

811
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,600
 Because I feel...

812
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,600
 ...so bored in the classroom.

813
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
 Because everything is so messy.

814
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,600
 It's like we're always...

815
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,600
 ...at night.

816
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
 What do you think, children?

817
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
 Right.

818
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,600
 We're out of class.

819
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
 Well.

820
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,600
 The professor will teach you...

821
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,600
 ...a very useful...

822
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
 ...and useful mantra for you.

823
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
 This mantra is called...

824
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
 ...Bovobovom.

825
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,600
 There's a bomb, professor.

826
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,600
 Are we going to make a bomb?

827
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
 Yes, that's right.

828
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
 More precisely.

829
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,600
 This mantra is useful for creating explosions.

830
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,600
 And it can also be used to shock the enemy.

831
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,600
 Do you want to?

832
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,600
 Yes.

833
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,600
 Thank you so much.

834
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,600
 Now, I'll show you an example.

835
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,600
 My children, pay attention.

836
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
 Okay.

837
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,600
 Pay attention, professor.

838
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,600
 Bovobo...

839
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:28,600
 What's that, professor?

840
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,600
 A bomb, professor.

841
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,600
 A bomb, professor?

842
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
 Yes.

843
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
 Bomb!

844
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,600
 Wow.

845
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:48,600
 That's what a titan, professor.

846
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,600
 The bomb is used as an explosion controller.

847
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,600
 And it can be exploded anytime.

848
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
 It can be controlled like a bomb.

849
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,600
 Give it a smile.

850
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
 Okay? / Yes.

851
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
 Now, you go forward.

852
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
 Yes.

853
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,600
 You just practiced the mantra.

854
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,600
 Bovobo...

855
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:32,600
 The bomb is back.

856
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,600
 You're right.

857
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,600
 The professor is right.

858
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
 The bomb is back.

859
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:43,600
 We've arrived at the school.

860
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,600
 Hold on tight.

861
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,600
 I'll be right there.

862
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,600
 All the children will be happy to see you, professor.

863
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,600
 Where are you going, professor?

864
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,600
 Bovobo...

865
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:07,600
 Where are my children?

866
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,600
 Come on.

867
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,600
 Go back to the classroom.

868
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,600
 Give it a smile.

869
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,600
 I miss you, but don't hit me, professor.

870
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,600
 Professor Ranggarbaran.

871
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,600
 It's not fun to have professor Ranggarbaran.

872
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,600
 I can't be a student of your favorite school anymore.

873
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,600
 I'm also happy to be able to go back to school.

874
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,600
 And I'm sorry...

875
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,600
 for all the things that happened lately.

876
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
 But I promise you.

877
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,600
 I'll go back to school as always.

878
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,600
 Okay.

879
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
 Let's go.

880
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
 We're back to school.

881
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
 Yes.

882
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,600
 That's enough, children.

883
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,600
 Now, professor Aldebaran will go back to work.

884
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
 Come on, professor.

885
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,600
 Professor Tita, please continue your lesson.

886
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
 Thank you, professor Aldebaran.

887
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:17,600
 Give it a smile, children.

888
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,600
 Now, we're back to the professor's lesson.

889
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,600
 Do you understand?

890
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,600
 Now, continue your lesson.

891
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,600
 Yes.

892
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,600
 Don't forget.

893
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:39,600
 Why did you do this to me?

894
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
 I'm sorry.

895
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
 I didn't mean to.

896
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,600
 I'm sorry.

897
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
 I'm sorry.

898
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:53,600
 You're so slow.

899
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:59,600
 I'm so glad that I don't have your strength.

900
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,600
 Bang Heran!

901
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,600
 Please, Bang Heran!

902
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
 Oh, my God!

903
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,600
 Bang Heran!

904
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
 Bang Heran, I'm begging you!

905
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,600
 Bang Heran!

906
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,600
 Bang Heran!

907
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,600
 How dare you eat me?

908
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
 Watch out.

909
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
 I'm a fast learner.

910
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,600
 But, he doesn't want to.

911
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,600
 Watch out!

912
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
 Don't eat me!

913
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,600
 You're so slow.

914
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,600
 You're so slow.

915
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,600
 You're sick, but you still make me sick.

916
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,600
 You're sick, but you still make me sick.

917
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:48,600
 Don't eat me!

918
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,600
 Watch out!

919
00:57:50,600 --> 00:58:02,600
 The professor is so mean.

920
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,600
 He's so mean.

921
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
 He's so mean.

922
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,600
 What should we do?

923
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,600
 You go and look for the professor.

924
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,600
 I'll help you.

925
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,600
 You untie the rope.

926
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,600
 Okay, Karva.

927
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:29,600
 Bang Heran!

928
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
 Bang Heran!

929
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,600
 Bang Heran!

930
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,600
 Bang Heran!

931
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:47,600
 We're going to the North.

932
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,600
 Be careful.

933
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,600
 You too.

934
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,600
 Come here, you slowpoke!

935
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
 Come here, you coward!

936
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
 You slowpoke!

937
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,600
 To be continued...

938
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,600
 Let's go!

939
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:19,600
 To be continued...

940
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,600
 We can do it!

941
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,600
 Come here, you slowpoke!

942
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
 Come here!

943
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,600
 Why are you here?

944
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,600
 The professor is angry.

945
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
 So, I'm here to help.

946
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,600
 You can't help me.

947
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
 I'm the head of the school.

948
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,600
 You stay here.

949
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
 So, I can open the door.

950
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
 What's wrong with this kid?

951
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,600
 He's so arrogant.

952
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,600
 You're so mean, professor.

953
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
 Just leave him be.

954
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
 I'm the head of the school.

955
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
 That's weird.

956
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,600
 So weird.

957
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,600
 Queen Venus said...

958
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,600
 that the necklace belongs to her.

959
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,600
 It's been more than 1,500 years.

960
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,600
 Are you sure?

961
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,600
 We're 100% sure.

962
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,600
 Yes, sir.

963
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,600
 Because I saw a black smoke...

964
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,600
 in the soul stone.

965
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,600
 You're right, sir.

966
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,600
 It's not here.

967
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,600
 I didn't see it.

968
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,600
 What's wrong with you?

969
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,600
 You're so arrogant.

970
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,600
 You're so arrogant.

971
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,600
 You're so arrogant.

972
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,600
 You can't see the soldier...

973
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,600
 because he's an adult.

974
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,600
 He has a lot of sins.

975
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,600
 That's why you can't see him.

976
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,600
 You're so arrogant.

977
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,600
 You said he has a lot of sins.

978
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,600
 What's the relation between my sins...

979
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,600
 and the stone he's wearing?

980
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,600
 You forgot.

981
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,600
 The soldier is an adult.

982
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,600
 And an adult can't see the soul stone.

983
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
 The soul stone can only be seen by children.

984
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
 We can't see it.

985
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
 But why is it...

986
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,600
 why is the shape...

987
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,600
 is like that?

988
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,600
 The soldier also forgot...

989
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,600
 what the professor said.

990
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,600
 Remember, Negantara.

991
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,600
 Nick, Fija, Eric, and Oktav.

992
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,600
 The soul stone...

993
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,600
 can't only be seen by adults.

994
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
 But it can also be seen in another form.

995
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
 For example?

996
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
 Usually, the soul stone...

997
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,600
 will be sucked into ancient objects.

998
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,600
 Antique and very valuable.

999
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,600
 And there, it will find a safe house.

1000
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
 Because the owner...

1001
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
 will take good care of it.

1002
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,600
 And will never give it to anyone.

1003
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,600
 (The soldier is an adult)

1004
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:13,600
 How is it? Is it true, soldier?

1005
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,600
 The rainbow is colorful.

1006
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
 I'm sorry. I forgot.

1007
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,600
 That's unusual.

1008
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,600
 Alright then.

1009
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,600
 We'll act.

1010
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,600
 And we have to take...

1011
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,600
 the soul stone from Queen Venus.

1012
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,600
 Yes, soldier!

1013
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,600
 (The soldier is an adult)

1014
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:45,600
 Bring the rainbow to Surabaya.

1015
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,600
 Dear beautiful queen.

1016
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,600
 Give me the soul stone.

1017
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
 Wait.

1018
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
 Don't be rude to our queen.

1019
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,600
 You can take our queen's soul stone.

1020
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,600
 But you have to step on my body first.

1021
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,600
 How can I step on your body?

1022
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
 You're not even a body yet.

1023
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
 Soldier, the rainbow is not dead yet.

1024
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,600
 Hurry up and bring it back.

1025
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,600
 Bring it back.

1026
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,600
 Calm down, Men.

1027
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,600
 The rainbow weapon...

1028
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
 hasn't been brought out yet.

1029
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:28,600
 <i>Kincir-kincir, fly to the clouds.</i>

1030
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,600
 <i>Don't worry, dear queen who looks like a cloud.</i>

1031
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,600
 Dear queen.

1032
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,600
 I won't take the soul stone from the queen.

1033
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
 But I will buy it.

1034
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:56,600
 Calm down, Boy.

1035
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,600
 Bro, just relax.

1036
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:09,600
 Big burger.

1037
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:16,600
 What is this?

1038
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,600
 Nick, Eric.

1039
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,600
 Please open the box.

1040
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,600
 The content of this box...

1041
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,600
 will make the queen happy and the palace full.

1042
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:42,600
 This is real.

1043
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,600
 Not fake.

1044
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,600
 You think we're carrying a fake item?

1045
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,600
 You call this fake?

1046
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,600
 Queen.

1047
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,600
 All of these diamonds and gold...

1048
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,600
 are the work of a magic school student.

1049
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,600
 So, I'm sure that it's real.

1050
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:12,600
 Come here!

1051
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,600
 Come here!

1052
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,600
 Come here!

1053
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:27,600
 Men, let's go!

1054
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
 It's broken!

1055
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:58,600
 I can do it.

1056
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,600
 Yes!

1057
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:06,600
 Let me do it.

1058
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,600
 Let go, Ali!

1059
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,600
 The King of the Jungle

1060
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,600
 The King of the Jungle

1061
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:20,600
 What did you say?

1062
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,600
 Thank you? / Shut up!

1063
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
 I'm the head of this school.

1064
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,600
 How dare you!

1065
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,600
 Just say thank you.

1066
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,600
 I don't want to.

1067
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,600
 Shut up!

1068
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,600
 Sir.

1069
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
 Let's go back to school.

1070
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
 Sir.

1071
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
 I can do it.

1072
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,600
 The King of the Jungle

1073
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:54,600
 I can do it!

1074
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,600
 Thank you, Frita.

1075
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,600
 Let's go home.

1076
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
 Okay.

1077
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,600
 Come on, Bro.

1078
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
 Shut up!

1079
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
 I can do it.

1080
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,600
 You're so arrogant.

1081
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
 Okay.

1082
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,600
 See you later.

1083
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,600
 The King of the Jungle

1084
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:42,600
 Yes!

1085
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
 This is the professor.

1086
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,600
 The room.

1087
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
 The King of the Jungle

1088
01:07:48,600 --> 01:08:00,600
 Yes! I did it!

1089
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:06,600
 What are you waiting for?

1090
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
 The King of the Jungle

1091
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:25,600
 The King of the Jungle?

1092
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,600
 Sir.

1093
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,600
 So, this is how it is.

1094
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,600
 You're in cahoots with all of them.

1095
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
 You're a traitor!

1096
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,600
 Sir, you're misunderstanding.

1097
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,600
 I'm not asking for their help.

1098
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,600
 They're the ones who helped me.

1099
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:47,600
 I'll destroy the lollipop.

1100
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,600
 The lollipop?

1101
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:59,600
 What are we going to use it for?

1102
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,600
 Sir.

1103
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:07,600
 Anghara.

1104
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,600
 You've been pretending to be my follower.

1105
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,600
 But you're in cahoots with all of them.

1106
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,600
 No, sir.

1107
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,600
 Sir, don't get me wrong.

1108
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,600
 You're wrong.

1109
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,600
 This is the proof.

1110
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
 You're in cahoots with them.

1111
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,600
 I'm going to kill you.

1112
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,600
 I'll make you angry.

1113
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,600
 You're a traitor.

1114
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
 You're so mean.

1115
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,600
 Shut up.

1116
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,600
 Or maybe you're helping me...

1117
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,600
 because you're the ones who are betraying me.

1118
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
 Right?

1119
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
 Yes.

1120
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
 You're so rude.

1121
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,600
 You're angry.

1122
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
 But you're helping me.

1123
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,600
 Thank you.

1124
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,600
 What's that?

1125
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,600
 He's confused.

1126
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,600
 He's so smart.

1127
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,600
 Shut up.

1128
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,600
 How dare you.

1129
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,600
 I'm going to kill you all.

1130
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,600
 (The next day)

1131
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:31,600
 Wake up.

1132
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,600
 Get out of my way.

1133
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,600
 I was killed in the middle of the night.

1134
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,600
 It's okay. I'm dead.

1135
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,600
 How can a person be dead?

1136
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
 I don't know.

1137
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
 Because this school is a mantra school.

1138
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,600
 So, the evil spirit can't enter.

1139
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,600
 Shut up.

1140
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,600
 Who's the evil spirit?

1141
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
 It's me.

1142
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,600
 To be continued...

1143
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:17,600

1144
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:32,600
 (Thank you for watching)

1145
