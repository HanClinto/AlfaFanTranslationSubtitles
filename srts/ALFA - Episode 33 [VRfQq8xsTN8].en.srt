 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the stairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all the dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with all your might

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Go, go, go, be proud of yourself

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We can do it!

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 The Hamster

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 That hamster!

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Yes, I know that hamster!

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 That's Ryo's car!

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Or maybe it's just a coincidence

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Sir, our plan is going very well

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 All the magic school students are influenced by the love spell

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So, they all follow all the words from Ryo

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 What are you doing?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Hi, Ranggara

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Alva!

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 How dare you play with me?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Take this!

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Sir, I understand you now

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So, you're looking for the 8th prince and you're giving it to me?

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Yes, sir

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Please, write it down

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'm sorry, prince

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But, your plan has failed

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Leon knows everything

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And the kids are back to normal

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 That's enough!

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Prince, you have to be careful with Aldebaran

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 He's smarter than you think

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I can't lose to Professor Aldebaran

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Hello, sir

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 How are you?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Anggar, I'm here

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Anggar, is it true what you said?

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Our plan has failed?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Yes, sir

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I'm lucky that I managed to escape

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 That's enough

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 My plan has been ruined by Alva and Aldebaran

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Prince, you should be more careful with him

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Because, he's in love with Alva

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I can't believe it

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Anggar is a trustworthy person

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 What should I do?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 He told me that he's not a trustworthy person

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Why are you so jealous?

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Jealous?

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 He doesn't know that he's a trustworthy person

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 But, he's not a bad person

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 He's just like you

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Finally, we're here

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Now, I'm going to prove who's the real Professor Ragni

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Or Prince Aldebaran

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 The Prince

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Hey, kid! Why are you here?

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Get out! This is not a playground!

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I'm here to beat my uncle

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Get out!

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Ouch!

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Timidus!

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Hey, who are you? Don't come in!

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Tornado!

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Timidus!

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Timidus!

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Don't come in!

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Timidus! There's a video!

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Uncle! Where are you?

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 This is Leon!

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Let's go back to my room

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Let's go

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Guys! This is our friend!

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 We're friends!

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Why are you all tied up?

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 It's all because of the soldiers

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 They did this to us

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Help us, Prof! Let us go!

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Let go of me!

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Thank you, Prof!

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Who tied you up?

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Since the soldiers used the Rathovenus's soul stone

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Their attitude has changed

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 We're confused, Prof

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 We're all confused

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Where's Megantara?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Megantara is at the clinic, Prof

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 She's been injected with the virus

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I'll talk to her

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I'll go with you, Prof

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Let's go to the lab

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Let's go

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Let's go

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,540
 [What happened?]

104
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:35,080
 [What happened?]

105
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,740
 Thank you, Megantara.

106
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,580
 You've realized it.

107
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,580
 And good.

108
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,580
 You've managed to get the soul stone.

109
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,080
 It's not even Eid yet, and you're already wearing a dress of Alibaba.

110
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,580
 Alibara!

111
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,080
 Why are you here?

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
 In Batinbah?

113
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 Are you trying to surprise me?

114
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,080
 Megantara, you're so fierce.

115
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,580
 This must be the influence of the soul stone.

116
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,080
 Now give me the soul stone.

117
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,080
 You're so reckless, Aldebaran.

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
 You're just asking for it.

119
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,080
 To get this soul stone, I have to fight every day.

120
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,080
 I even have to face the devil cactus.

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,580
 You're just asking for it. You can't do it.

122
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
 Megantara, give me the stone.

123
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,080
 Come on, quick.

124
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,580
 What if I say no?

125
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,080
 Megantara, give me the stone.

126
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,580
 Aldebaran, you're challenging me?

127
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,080
 You dare to challenge me?

128
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,080
 If you dare, let's have a match.

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 What style do you want?

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,580
 What style do you want?

131
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,580
 Do you want kung fu?

132
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:50,580
 Where are you going?

133
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,580
 Alva, quick.

134
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,080
 Open the cage.

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,580
 Yes.

136
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:04,580
 Open the cage.

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
 Give it back.

138
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,580
 Open the cage.

139
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
 Yes.

140
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:26,580
 Professor.

141
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,580
 Aldebaran.

142
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
 Why am I tired?

143
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
 What did you do?

144
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,580
 You fought with Professor Aldebaran.

145
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,580
 Fight? Don't be ridiculous.

146
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,580
 You even challenged him to a duel.

147
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
 I challenged him to a duel?

148
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,580
 Who challenged him?

149
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
 Impossible.

150
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,580
 Don't be ridiculous.

151
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,580
 Impossible.

152
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,580
 This will affect your soul stone.

153
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
 Affect?

154
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,580
 So, I'm a part of the evil soul?

155
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
 I really wanted to challenge him.

156
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
 I'm sorry, Professor Aldebaran.

157
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
 I didn't mean to.

158
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,580
 It's okay, Megatara.

159
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
 You didn't realize it.

160
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
 Good.

161
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,580
 Now, we have the first soul stone.

162
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,580
 I'll continue with the sword.

163
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
 Yes, Professor.

164
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
 Let's go.

165
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,580
 I challenged Aldebaran.

166
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:40,580
 Grandpa.

167
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
 Leon.

168
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
 Leon, wake up.

169
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,580
 Grandpa.

170
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,580
 Where are you?

171
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,580
 It's true.

172
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
 You're still alive.

173
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
 Leon, don't.

174
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
 It's dangerous.

175
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
 Grandpa.

176
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:14,580
 What should I do?

177
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
 The fire is getting bigger.

178
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:24,580
 Grandpa.

179
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,580
 Leon, stop.

180
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,580
 You have to get out of here.

181
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
 It's dangerous.

182
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
 Grandpa.

183
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,580
 I want to free him.

184
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,580
 Please, get out of here.

185
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
 Hey.

186
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,580
 Don't do that.

187
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
 Don't hurt him.

188
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,580
 Let him go.

189
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
 He's just a kid.

190
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
 Don't hurt him.

191
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,580
 Please, don't hurt him.

192
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,580
 Leon.

193
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
 Leon.

194
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
 Grandpa.

195
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,580
 Leon.

196
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,580
 This is a punishment for the intruder.

197
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
 I want to free him.

198
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:16,580
 Adam.

199
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,580
 Leon, Orion's grandson tried to break into our fire prison.

200
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
 What?

201
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,580
 What are you doing?

202
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,580
 Why did a kid like you get into the prison?

203
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
 We're sorry, sir.

204
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,580
 Then, did he meet Orion?

205
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
 No, sir.

206
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,580
 We managed to catch Leon.

207
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,580
 Good.

208
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
 From now on,

209
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
 be careful.

210
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
 Don't let Orion and Leon get away.

211
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
 Yes, sir.

212
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,580
 Am I right, sir?

213
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,580
 We've lost.

214
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
 And Leon knows everything.

215
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,580
 We have to be more careful with Ankara.

216
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
 This is useless.

217
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,580
 If this continues, I'll run out of energy.

218
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,580
 I have to come up with a strategy.

219
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,580
 He...

220
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
 He has to be trapped.

221
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,580
 The Power Barrier.

222
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:46,580
 Catch that shadow.

223
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
 Catch the shadow.

224
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:56,580
 Good.

225
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
 Good.

226
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
 The power of the power.

227
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
 The power of the power.

228
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:23,580
 Where is it?

229
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,580
 Where is it?

230
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,580
 Where is it?

231
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
 Calome.

232
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
 I'm here.

233
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
 This heart...

234
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
 ...is not mine.

235
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,580
 Hold this.

236
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
 Call Alva.

237
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
 Yes, sir.

238
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,580
 Finally, I managed to catch this annoying creature.

239
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,580
 Okay.

240
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,580
 I have to go see him.

241
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:38,580
 I'm here.

242
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,580
 Hide.

243
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,580
 And the last one is...

244
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
 ...the black owl.

245
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,580
 What is this?

246
00:15:52,580 --> 00:16:00,580
 This creature...

247
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,580
 ...will make the 8th Pingisan's king.

248
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,580
 I can take his legs.

249
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,580
 I can take his legs.

250
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:22,580
 What are you doing?

251
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,580
 Sir.

252
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,580
 You scared me.

253
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,580
 What are you doing?

254
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
 Sir.

255
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,580
 This...

256
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
 I'm making a potion to increase stamina.

257
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,580
 I made it especially for you.

258
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:54,580
 Why?

259
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
 It doesn't smell good.

260
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,580
 It's called Jahamut.

261
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
 Nothing smells good, sir.

262
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:16,580
 Sir.

263
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,580
 Why did you destroy it?

264
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,580
 You, Fik.

265
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,580
 I don't know what I'm going to do with you.

266
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,580
 You want to give me up, right?

267
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
 Sir.

268
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,580
 Don't judge me like that.

269
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
 You got it wrong.

270
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,580
 I'm going to destroy you.

271
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
 So, you can't go back to school.

272
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,580
 And tell everyone that Alva is a traitor.

273
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,580
 Get ready.

274
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,580

 Try to break the sword.

289
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:25,580
 What do you mean, sir?

290
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,580
 What did you say?

291
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,580
 Now.

292
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,580
 You push the sword to the soul stone.

293
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,580
 I tried it, but it didn't work.

294
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
 Why me, sir?

295
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
 If the prince can't do it, why me?

296
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
 Alva.

297
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,580
 Your destiny is tied to the eighth hand.

298
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,580
 Since you were born, you've made the eighth prince lose his power.

299
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
 Because of that, I'm sure...

300
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,580
 ...only you can destroy the eighth prince's soul stone.

301
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:07,580
 Let's go, Alva.

302
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580

 Alva.

321
00:19:47,580 --> 00:20:02,580
 Sir.

322
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
 Sir, wake up.

323
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
 Sir, what's wrong?

324
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
 Sir.

325
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
 Wow, you're awake.

326
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
 You didn't even sleep.

327
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,580
 The eighth prince can't do it.

328
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,580
 Let's go.

329
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,580
 Sir.

330
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,580
 Sir, you can't do it.

331
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,580
 Wake up.

332
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
 Sir.

333
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,580
 So, I can take your leg?

334
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
 Yes.

335
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:43,580
 Very good.

336
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,580
 We've destroyed the first soul stone.

337
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
 Yes.

338
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,580
 Hey.

339
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,580
 Jambu Batu, Fruit Pineapple.

340
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
 Destroyed one.

341
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
 There are still 11.

342
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
 We're still in the middle.

343
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
 Wow, that's beautiful.

344
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,580
 Our journey is still long.

345
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,580
 Kids, we can't give up.

346
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,580
 Now, it's time to find the second soul stone.

347
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
 Where is the second soul stone, sir?

348
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
 The second soul stone...

349
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
 is controlled by a creature...

350
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
 named Bati.

351
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,580
 It's a dragon.

352
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,580
 It's a dragon, Ben.

353
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
 It's not a dragon.

354
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
 It's a serpent.

355
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
 Enough.

356
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
 Don't joke.

357
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,580
 This is a serious matter.

358
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,580

 Help!

361
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
 A bomb.

 Sir!

369
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
 What's going on?

370
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
 There's a bomb.

371
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
 Help!

372
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
 Who's that?

373
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
 Help!

 I'm sorry.

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,580
 I'm hungry.

 I'm sorry.

 Sir.

385
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,580
 He's a female demon.

386
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
 His brother is Barga.

387
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,580
 That's scary.

388
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,580
 Barga is a male demon.

389
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,580
 While Barga is a female demon.

390
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,580
 It's easier for a woman to be a demon, right?

391
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
 Yes.

392
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,580
 So, it's weaker.

393
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,580
 Wait.

394
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,580
 Barga is more fierce than Barga.

395
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,580
 And he's 10 times stronger than Barga.

396
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:43,580
 I'm hungry.

397
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
 I'm hungry.

398
00:23:45,580 --> 00:24:03,580
 I'm hungry.

399
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:10,580
 You're a slug.

400
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,580
 You're a slug.

401
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:24,580
 Where is he now?

402
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
 Where is Barga now?

403
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:40,580
 It's huge.

404
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,580
 Is that a big slug or a small slug?

405
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,580
 It can be a slug.

406
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,580
 Yes, especially a slug.

407
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
 It's a holiday.

408
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
 Do you see that?

409
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
 It's a slug.

410
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
 What's in it?

411
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:07,580
 Oh my God.

412
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:14,580
 He's in danger. We have to help him.

413
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
 I'm scared.

414
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,580
 He's in danger. We have to help him.

415
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
 I'm scared.

416
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
 He's a slug.

417
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,580
 We have to go there.

418
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,580
 Professor, let me accompany the kid.

419
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
 Kids, get ready.

420
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
 Let's go.

421
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:43,580
 Leon, Leon.

422
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
 I'm okay.

423
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
 Leon, my grandson.

424
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,580
 Leon.

425
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,580
 Grandpa.

426
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,580
 Grandpa, is this really you?

427
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,580
 Yes, it's me.

428
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
 I'm dreaming, right?

429
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
 No, you're not dreaming.

430
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,580
 You're in the same prison as me.

431
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,580
 In the fire prison.

432
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,580
 Grandpa.

433
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:14,580
 Leon, my grandson.

434
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
 I miss you, Leon.

435
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
 I miss you, Grandpa.

436
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,580
 Grandpa. / Yes.

437
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
 Forgive me.

438
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
 I can't help you.

439
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,580
 No, I'm the one who should apologize to you.

440
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,580
 Because you're suffering in this prison.

441
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
 It's okay, Grandpa.

442
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
 I'm happy wherever I am.

443
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
 As long as you're here.

444
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,580
 I want to be with you, Leon.

445
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,580
 Grandpa.

446
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,580
 You promised that we can get out of here.

447
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
 Yes, we have to get out.

448
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
 Grandpa.

449
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:09,580
 Kids, are you ready to fly?

450
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
 Yes.

451
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
 Get your lollipop ready.

452
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,580
 We're going to fight against the Bargi monster.

453
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,580
 Okay. / Ready?

454
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
 One, two, three.

455
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,580
 Three, two, one.

456
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
 Let's count to three and fly.

457
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,580
 One, two, three.

458
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
 Now!

459
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:58,580
 That feeling.

460
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,580
 I saw a ghost.

461
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,580
 What if it's just a dream?

462
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,580
 But it hurts so much.

463
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:20,580
 A ghost.

464
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:27,580
 So, this is not a dream.

465
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,580
 You're my future husband.

466
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,580
 My future husband.

467
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:50,580
 This is the power of Megatron.

468
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,580
 I don't understand what you mean.

469
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,580
 Calm down.

470
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,580
 Let me read your mind.

471
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:15,580
 Don't hurt her.

472
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
 Don't hurt her. Let her go.

473
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
 She's just a kid.

474
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
 She's just a kid.

475
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,580
 Don't hurt her.

476
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,580
 Leon.

477
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,580
 Leon is in danger.

478
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,580
 I have to go there.

479
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:43,580
 Bargi headquarters?

480
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,580
 Bargi headquarters?

481
00:29:46,580 --> 00:30:11,580
 Professor Rita.

482
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
 Professor Libaran.

483
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
 Hi.

484
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
 You're smiling, Professor Aldebaran.

485
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,580
 I'm sorry.

486
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,580
 I got hurt because of my children.

487
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
 They're in love.

488
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,580
 So, I was attacked by my own magic.

489
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,580
 Okay.

490
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,580
 Take Titan to the clinic.

491
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
 I have to go.

492
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
 Where are you going, Professor Aldebaran?

493
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,580
 I'm going to the fire prison.

494
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
 The fire prison?

495
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
 Why are you going there?

496
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,580
 I have to save Leon.

497
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,580
 He's in the fire prison...

498
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,580
 ...because he tried to save his leg.

499
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
 Professor Aldebaran.

500
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
 I can't just sit here.

501
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,580
 While Scorsese is being attacked, I'm going to help.

502
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,580
 Don't, Professor. This is dangerous.

503
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,580
 Because this is dangerous, I'm going to accompany you.

504
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
 Okay, then.

505
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
 Titan, Yasmin, you take care of the school.

506
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
 Okay, Professor.

507
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,580
 Professor Aldebaran, we should go.

508
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,580
 I'm going to use the lollipop.

509
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
 Don't, Purwa.

510
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
 We can't use the lollipop.

511
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580
 Why, Professor?

512
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,580
 Because the fire guard can sense our arrival.

513
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
 What should we do now?

514
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,580
 The fire guard can't see.

515
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,580
 He can only sense our presence.

516
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,580
 We have to turn ourselves into animals.

517
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
 Animals?

518
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:59,580
 My husband's candidate.

519
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,580
 My husband's candidate?

520
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
 What kind of dream is this?

521
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,580
 I can't believe I'm meeting you like this.

522
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:27,580
 Where is he going?

523
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,580
 That's not important.

524
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,580
 What's important is that I have to leave this place.

525
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
 But how?

526
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,580
 I'm going to use the magic of the place's divinity.

527
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
 The divinity...

528
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,580
 of my husband.

529
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
 Where is my husband?

530
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,580
 Where is he?

531
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
 He's my husband.

532
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
 Finally.

533
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
 Okay, I have to take him.

534
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:15,580
 I'm going to make it this time.

535
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:30,580
 Eat this.

536
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
 Eat this.

537
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,580
 I'm sorry.

538
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,580
 I'm not hungry.

539
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
 Eat this.

540
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:52,580
 I said I'm not hungry. I want to go home.

541
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
 It hurts.

542
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,580
 What's that monster?

543
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:18,580
 Do you want to be my husband?

544
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,580
 Do you want to marry me?

545
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:29,580
 Marry?

546
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
 Marry?

547
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:53,580
 Where is the monster? I want to see him.

548
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
 Eat vinegar and tofu.

549
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
 I don't know either.

550
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,580
 Guys, let's go to my house.

551
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,580
 Who knows, my husband might run away...

552
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
 and come back to his house.

553
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,580
 Okay? -Okay.

554
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,580
 Also, check on my condition and your condition.

555
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:18,580
 Is there anyone who can help me?

556
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,580
 I'm going to be left behind.

557
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
 I'm going to be left behind.

558
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:30,580
 Mr. Panji!

559
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:40,580
 There's no one here.

560
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
 I think there's no one here.

561
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
 Wait.

562
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
 Be quiet.

563
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,580
 I think it's from that way.

564
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,580
 I think it's from that way.

565
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,580
 I heard a music.

566
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,580
 Music from that room.

567
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,580
 That's my room.

568
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
 Where is it?

569
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:13,580
 It's from that room.

570
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
 Let's go.

571
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,580
 Why not?

572
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
 That's my uncle's dirty clothes.

573
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
 That's right. It stinks.

574
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
 Let's wear our clothes and go there.

575
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,580
 My dirty clothes?

576
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
 It stinks?

577
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
 Instead of throwing up, we can throw up.

578
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,580
 How can I be that dirty?

579
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,580
 I thought I'm the only one who's dirty.

580
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,580
 Let's go there.

581
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,580
 Wait for me here.

582
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:54,580
 If you're angry, eat this.

583
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,580
 Hurry up. Don't use your hands.

584
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:05,580
 I'm sorry, sir.

585
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
 We have to lie to you.

586
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,580
 Because Mr. Panji told us to keep this a secret from anyone.

587
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
 For the sake of my mother and father.

588
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,580
 What's wrong?

589
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,580
 Let's go, sir.

590
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:37,580
 Why is it like this?

591
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,580
 Oh no.

592
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,580
 Music from that room.

593
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:59,580
 The infusion is always active.

594
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,580
 What infusion?

595
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,580
 There's an infusion that always makes my parents angry.

596
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,580
 I thought the person is a criminal.

597
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,580
 But, the professor is on our side.

598
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,580
 But, he's not the one who infuses the medicine.

599
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,580
 That's right.

600
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
 Who else could it be?

601
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,580
 Why does it take so long for Alva and Vega to come?

602
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
 They said it's only a short time.

603
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,580
 Is it really in the place where I keep my dirty clothes?

604
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,580
 Yes.

605
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
 It smells.

606
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
 Yes.

607
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
 Can we throw up?

608
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
 Yes.

609
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:01,580
 Wait for me here.

610
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
 I'll be right back.

611
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
 I know.

612
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,580
 Don't eat meat with me.

613
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,580
 Don't be a coward, Megantara.

614
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,580
 You're such a coward.

615
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,580
 How dare you call Megantara a coward.

616
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
 Who's a coward?

617
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
 What's next?

618
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,580
 It's so sour.

619
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,580
 Why does it take so long for Alva and Vega to come?

620
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,580
 Can we throw up?

621
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,580
 I mean, can we drink coffee?

622
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
 Can we eat meat?

623
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
 Can we?

624
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:43,580
 Here, wear the glasses.

625
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
 It's so hard to wear the glasses now.

626
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
 The glasses are from the 8th floor.

627
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,580
 We have to wear the glasses so we can know...

628
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,580
 ...that there's a sorcerer who wants to infiltrate our prison.

629
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:02,580
 That's the prison.

630
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,580
 Remember, never change into a human.

631
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,580
 If you do, the guards will arrest us.

632
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,580
 Daniel, what he's doing is too much.

633
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
 He's bothering your powerless parents.

634
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,580
 Yes, that's why I'm so mad at him.

635
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,580
 And I have to find the sorcerer.

636
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,580
 "The Sorcerer"

637
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:43,580
 Who's that?

638
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
 Why is no one here?

639
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,580
 "The Sorcerer"

640
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:56,580
 What's that?

641
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,580
 It's a letter.

642
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
 Let me see.

643
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,580
 "The Sorcerer"

644
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
 The headquarters of the Barji...

645
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:46,580
 According to our rules, the loser...

646
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,580
 ...has to follow the winner's wishes.

647
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,580
 "The Sorcerer"

648
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,580
 "The Sorcerer"

649
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:07,580
 Let's go inside.

650
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
 Get ready, Professor.

651
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:16,580
 There's an intruder!

652
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,580
 Let's attack!

653
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,580
 "The Sorcerer"

654
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:28,580
 This is a good chance.

655
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,580
 Since the Dark Lord is unconscious, I have to get rid of him.

656
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:40,580
 Nara.

657
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,580
 What are you doing?

658
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,580
 Agni.

659
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,580
 Don't tell me you're going to make a mistake again.

660
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,580
 I'm currently curing the Dark Lord.

661
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,580
 Who knows, he might faint because he's tired.

662
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
 I'll cure his legs.

663
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:11,580
 Yes, get in.

664
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
 Yes.

665
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,580
 Thank you.

666
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,580
 Ankara!

667
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,580
 Attack!

668
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:29,580
 What's wrong, sir?

669
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
 Nothing, sir.

670
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
 I'll take care of it.

671
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
 I'm a sorcerer.

672
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,580
 I won't let you pass.

673
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,580
 Now, sir.

674
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,580
 Here I come!

675
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,580
 "The Sorcerer"

676
00:43:46,580 --> 00:44:08,580
 Merik!

677
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,580
 No.

678
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
 Don't.

679
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,580
 We still need them.

680
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,580
 We still need them.

681
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,580
 I have a better idea.

682
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,580
 What is it, Professor?

683
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:32,580
 I agree, Professor.

684
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,580
 Let's bring them.

685
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
 Come on.

686
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,580
 "The Sorcerer"

687
00:44:43,580 --> 00:45:03,580
 Did you meet your parents?

688
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
 Yes, I did.

689
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
 They're okay.

690
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,580
 But, there's a snitch.

691
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,580
 A snitch?

692
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,580
 Listen.

693
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
 What are you talking about?

694
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
 Stop whining.

695
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,580
 I'm not invited.

696
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,580
 Bye, sir.

697
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,580
 You can invite us if you want.

698
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,580
 I want to know.

699
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,580
 I want to know.

700
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,580
 I'm tired.

701
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
 Where did you get the clue?

702
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
 A snitch came into the room.

703
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,580
 I found this map on the snitch.

704
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,580
 What does this map say?

705
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:52,580
 It's morning.

706
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,580
 Let's go there.

707
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
 Okay.

708
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
 Wait.

709
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
 Think.

710
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,580
 This could be a trap.

711
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,580
 "The Sorcerer"

712
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,580
 What if it's not a trap?

713
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
 That's right.

714
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,580
 I think we should follow him.

715
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,580
 We don't know where the base is.

716
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
 We have to save him.

717
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
 That's right.

718
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,580
 We have to go there.

719
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,580
 That's right.

720
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,580
 Wait.

721
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,580
 Let's think.

722
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,580
 Let's go to the school.

723
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,580
 Okay.

724
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,580
 But, remember.

725
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,580
 We have to be careful.

726
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,580
 Okay.

727
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,580
 Let's go.

728
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:51,580
 Let's go.

729
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,580
 Kneel.

730
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,580
 It seems safe.

731
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,580
 Now, we have to go out.

732
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,580
 "The Sorcerer"

733
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:26,580
 We did it.

734
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,580
 Let's go in.

735
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,580
 Let's go in now.

736
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,580
 Okay.

737
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:47,580
 We're here.

738
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,580
 Where is the base?

739
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,580
 Let's go around.

740
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,580
 If the map is correct, we're not far from here.

741
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,580
 Okay.

742
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,580
 I'll go first.

743
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,580
 You guys, follow me.

744
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:15,580
 I'm confused.

745
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,580
 Who is the sorcerer?

746
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,580
 I think...

747
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,580
 ...he's our age.

748
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,580
 What?

749
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,580
 Our age?

750
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,580
 He's still a kid.

751
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,580
 Yes.

752
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,580
 I heard a voice in my parents' room.

753
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,580
 It can't be a kid.

754
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,580
 He's so strong.

755
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,580
 He can destroy the ground.

756
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
 Mr. Panji, where is he?

757
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,580
 I don't know.

758
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,580
 Here.

759
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,580
 What?

760
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,580
 What can't you do?

761
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,580
 You guys are always noisy.

762
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,580
 I'm not asking you to do anything.

763
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,580
 What can't you do?

764
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,580
 We're confused.

765
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,580
 You said you're confused.

766
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,580
 What can't you do?

767
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,580
 You're so slow.

768
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,580
 Let's go.

769
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
 Come on, girls.

770
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
 I'm a sorcerer.

771
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,580
 That's...

772
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,580
 That's...

773
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,580
 That's Mr. Bargi.

774
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,580
 He's in the headquarters.

775
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,580
 Did you hear that?

776
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,580
 There's a sorcerer.

777
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,580
 He's a coward.

778
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,580
 He's so strong.

779
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,580
 Don't be afraid.

780
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,580
 Who's afraid?

781
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,580
 We're not afraid.

782
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,580
 Maybe your soldiers are afraid.

783
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,580
 You're a kid.

784
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,580
 You're the one who's afraid.

785
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,580
 There's Mr. Bargi.

786
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,580
 Bye.

787
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,580
 The headquarters is near.

788
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:13,580
 You're kidding, right?

789
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,580
 Bargi is getting married.

790
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,580
 Okay.

791
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,580
 Let go of my hand.

792
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,580
 Okay.

793
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,580
 Here's the thing.

794
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:36,580
 I want to tell you that getting married is a hassle.

795
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,580
 Because we have to prepare a lot of things.

796
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,580
 For example, we have to have a wedding.

797
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,580
 We have to prepare a wedding.

798
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,580
 We have to prepare a wedding dress.

799
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,580
 We have to save a lot of money.

800
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,580
 And one more thing.

801
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,580
 We have to do the job.

802
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,580
 I'm a waitress.

803
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,580
 I don't have a job.

804
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
 So, don't worry about me.

805
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,580
 Bargi is getting married.

806
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,580
 Okay.

807
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,580
 Okay.

808
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,580
 Okay.

809
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,580
 Agni.

810
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,580
 Why did you take my daughter?

811
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:24,580
 What weapon did you use?

812
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,580
 What weapon?

813
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,580
 Don't lie.

814
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,580
 Agni.

815
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,580
 Agni, click.

816
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,580
 Agni.

817
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,580
 What is this?

818
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,580
 That's...

819
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
 a foot-puller.

820
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,580
 You're going to take the blood of the 8th prince with this, right?

821
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,580
 Right?

822
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,580
 Why?

823
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,580
 Agni.

824
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,580
 A foot-puller.

825
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,580
 To take the blood of the 8th prince.

826
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,580
 How could you?

827
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
 You're a teacher, but how?

828
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,580
 I don't trust you.

829
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,580
 Don't lie.

830
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,580
 Agni.

831
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,580
 As long as you know...

832
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,580
 I used that...

833
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
 to take the hair of the 8th prince.

834
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,580
 There are a lot of hair.

835
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,580
 Who knows that's what makes him weak.

836
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,580
 He easily faints.

837
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,580
 There are a lot of bacteria in his hair.

838
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,580
 We have to take it off.

839
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,580
 Liar.

840
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,580
 I don't trust you.

841
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,580
 Liar.

842
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:45,580
 So, you're the one who's going to fight.

843
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,580
 Alright.

844
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,580
 How about we make a rule?

845
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,580
 The one who wins...

846
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:54,580
 will follow the rule.

847
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,580
 How?

848
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,580
 Who's scared?

849
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
 Hey, you guys.

850
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:08,580
 Now it's your turn to guard here.

851
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,580
 Alright.

852
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,580
 I'm heading there.

853
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,580
 Yes.

854
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,580
 Alright.

855
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,580
 You guys guard here.

856
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,580
 We'll follow the rule.

857
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,580
 Alright.

858
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
 We'll guard here.

859
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:25,580
 Professor.

860
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,580
 I thought we knew each other.

861
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,580
 Don't lie.

862
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,580
 We'll keep on walking.

863
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:39,580
 What's this?

864
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,580
 You lost, Agni.

865
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,580
 According to our rule...

866
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,580
 the loser...

867
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,580
 has to follow the winner's will.

868
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,580
 Alright.

869
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,580
 Now...

870
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,580
 what do I have to do?

871
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:12,380
 Hi Hi Hi Hi

872
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,380
  depth of consciousness

873
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:29,380
 Beware guys, Vega!

874
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:36,380
 Vega, you're okay right?

875
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,380
 yes, Vega, are you okay?

876
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,380
 what's wrong, papa?

877
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,380
 what's wrong, papa?

878
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,380
 you've saved me

879
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,380
 no, I haven't

880
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,380
 you haven't done anything

881
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:52,380
 yes, that's right

882
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,380
 it's not Alva who saved you, Vega

883
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:00,380
 but, but who?

884
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,380
 I don't know either

885
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,380
 but if I look closely

886
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,380
 the light is coming from those bushes

887
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:28,380
 beware, Vega

888
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,380
 the light is coming from those bushes

889
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:54,380
 attack!

890
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,380
 Leo, bring the other team, quick!

891
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,380
 yes!

892
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:24,380
 open the cell

893
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,380
 for what?

894
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,380
 we will bring Orion and Leon to the 8th prince

895
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,380
 because they will get the death sentence tonight

896
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,380
 right

897
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,380
 this is the direct order from the 8th prince

898
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,380
 yes, sir

899
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:52,380
 what should we do, Kate?

900
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,380
 we will be sentenced to death

901
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,380
 Leon, you have to run

902
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,380
 so that grandpa will be punished

903
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,380
 no, I don't want to leave him

904
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,380
 I want to be here with him

905
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:17,380
 what's wrong with me?

906
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,380
 what's wrong with me?

907
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,380
 good evening, prince

908
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,380
 how can I sleep here?

909
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,380
 yes, you fainted

910
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:35,380
 now, I want to do a cleansing ritual for you

911
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,380
 are you ready?

912
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,380
 let's start

913
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,380
 I will give you a cleansing ritual

914
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,380
 are you ready?

915
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,380
 let's start

916
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:54,380
 what are you doing?

917
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,380
 you fainted, right?

918
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,380
 it's because of the bacteria on your feet

919
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,380
 so that you won't faint easily

920
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,380
 I will cleanse you

921
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,380
 are you ready?

922
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,380
 take a deep breath

923
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,380
 hold it

924
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,380
 let's start

925
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,380
 the other foot

926
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,380
 right

927
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,380
 one

928
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,380
 two

929
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,380
 three

930
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:27,380
 wait, it's not done yet

931
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,380
 again

932
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,380
 let him finish it

933
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,380
 it hurts

934
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,380
 finally, it's done

935
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,380
 I got the eight-legged owl

936
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,380
 yes

937
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,380
 what's wrong?

938
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
 hello

939
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,380
 yes, it's true

940
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,380
 there's someone there

941
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,380
 and he saved me

942
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,380
 don't tell me that person is the same person

943
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,380
 who gave the map of the bargy headquarters

944
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,380
 but we still have to be careful

945
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,380
 who knows

946
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,380
 that person has evil intentions

947
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:35,380
 hold it

948
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,380
 give me the stone

949
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:45,380
 I will check this stone

950
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,380
 scanning the stone

951
00:59:49,380 --> 01:00:03,380
 it's safe

952
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,380
 this stone is just a normal stone

953
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,380
 there's no magic in it

954
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,380

955
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:21,380
 hello

956
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,380

957
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,380

958
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,380
 hello

959
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,380
 hey, come out

960
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,380
 don't hide, come out, good person

961
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:37,380
 even though you're a good person, you have to make it beautiful

962
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,380
 come with us

963
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,380

964
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,380
 calm down, Orion

965
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,380
 this is me, Aldebaran

966
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,380
 Aldebaran?

967
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,380
 yes, this is me, Aldebaran

968
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,380
 and that's Professor Tumba

969
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,380
 we will set you free

970
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,380
 but you have to calm down

971
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,380
 don't panic

972
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,380
 we will catch you

973
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,380

974
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,380
 let's go

975
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:21,380
 that looks like a magician

976
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:28,380
 what are you doing?

977
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:34,380
 I'm sorry for disturbing you

978
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,380
 what's wrong?

979
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,380
 I want to ask

980
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:42,380
 did you order the two supervisors to release Orion and Lel?

981
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,380
 don't joke

982
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,380
 I never ordered that

983
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,380
 but the two supervisors told me

984
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,380
 there must be a magician

985
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,380
 hurry, catch the magician

986
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,380

987
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,380

991
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:15,380
 Professor, it seems like they are suspicious of us

992
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,380
 stay alert

993
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,380

 what's that sound?

1006
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,380
 maybe he's about to be eaten

1007
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:23,380
 we can do it

1008
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:33,380

1027
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,380
 it's dangerous

 Don't fall, okay?

 It hurts here.

 Why?

 Why are you like this?

 No, actually, you're healthier now.

1055
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,960
 Because all the bacteria are gone.

1056

 Now I want to throw it away, okay?

 We will trade souls again with these officers.
