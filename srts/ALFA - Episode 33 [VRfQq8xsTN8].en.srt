That hamster!

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, I know that hamster!

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's Ryo's car!

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or maybe it's just a coincidence

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sir, our plan is going very well

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All the magic school students are influenced by the love spell

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So, they all follow all the words from Ryo

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hi, Ranggara

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alfa!

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How dare you play with me?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Take this!

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sir, I understand you now

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, you're looking for the 8th prince and you're giving it to me?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, sir

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Please, write it down

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry, prince

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But, your plan has failed

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Leon knows everything

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And the kids are back to normal

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's enough!

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Prince, you have to be careful with Aldebaran

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's smarter than you think

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I can't lose to Professor Aldebaran

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hello, sir

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How are you?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Anggar, I'm here

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Anggar, is it true what you said?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Our plan has failed?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, sir

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm lucky that I managed to escape

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's enough

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My plan has been ruined by Alfa and Aldebaran

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Prince, you should be more careful with him

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because, he's in love with Alfa

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't believe it

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Anggar is a trustworthy person

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What should I do?

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He told me that he's not a trustworthy person

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why are you so jealous?

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Jealous?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He doesn't know that he's a trustworthy person

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But, he's not a bad person

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's just like you

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Finally, we're here

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, I'm going to prove who's the real Professor Ragni

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Or Prince Aldebaran

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Prince

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hey, kid! Why are you here?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Get out! This is not a playground!

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm here to beat my uncle

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Get out!

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ouch!

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Timidus!

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey, who are you? Don't come in!

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Tornado!

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Timidus!

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't come in!

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Timidus! There's a video!

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Uncle! Where are you?

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is Leon!

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go back to my room

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Guys! This is our friend!

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We're friends!

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why are you all tied up?

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's all because of the soldiers

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They did this to us

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Help us, Prof! Let us go!

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let go of me!

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you, Prof!

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Who tied you up?

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Since the soldiers used the Rathovenus's soul stone

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Their attitude has changed

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We're confused, Prof

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We're all confused

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Where's Megantara?

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Megantara is at the clinic, Prof

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
She's been injected with the virus

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll talk to her

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll go with you, Prof

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's go to the lab

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's go

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:35,080
[What happened?]

99
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,740
Thank you, Megantara.

100
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,580
You've realized it.

101
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,580
And good.

102
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,580
You've managed to get the soul stone.

103
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,080
It's not even Eid yet, and you're already wearing a dress of Alibaba.

104
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,580
Alibara!

105
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,080
Why are you here?

106
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
In Batinbah?

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Are you trying to surprise me?

108
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Megantara, you're so fierce.

109
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,580
This must be the influence of the soul stone.

110
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,080
Now give me the soul stone.

111
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,080
You're so reckless, Aldebaran.

112
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
You're just asking for it.

113
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,080
To get this soul stone, I have to fight every day.

114
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,080
I even have to face the devil cactus.

115
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,580
You're just asking for it. You can't do it.

116
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Megantara, give me the stone.

117
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,080
Come on, quick.

118
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,580
What if I say no?

119
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,080
Megantara, give me the stone.

120
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,580
Aldebaran, you're challenging me?

121
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,080
You dare to challenge me?

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,080
If you dare, let's have a match.

123
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,580
What style do you want?

124
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,580
Do you want kung fu?

125
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:50,580
Where are you going?

126
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Alfa, quick.

127
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,080
Open the cage.

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,580
Yes.

129
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Open the cage.

130
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
Give it back.

131
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,580
Open the cage.

132
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Yes.

133
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:26,580
Professor.

134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Aldebaran.

135
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Why am I tired?

136
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
What did you do?

137
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,580
You fought with Professor Aldebaran.

138
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,580
Fight? Don't be ridiculous.

139
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,580
You even challenged him to a duel.

140
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
I challenged him to a duel?

141
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Who challenged him?

142
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Impossible.

143
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Don't be ridiculous.

144
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,580
Impossible.

145
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,580
This will affect your soul stone.

146
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
Affect?

147
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,580
So, I'm a part of the evil soul?

148
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
I really wanted to challenge him.

149
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
I'm sorry, Professor Aldebaran.

150
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
I didn't mean to.

151
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,580
It's okay, Megatara.

152
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
You didn't realize it.

153
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
Good.

154
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Now, we have the first soul stone.

155
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,580
I'll continue with the sword.

156
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
Yes, Professor.

157
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
Let's go.

158
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,580
I challenged Aldebaran.

159
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:40,580
Grandpa.

160
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
Leon.

161
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Leon, wake up.

162
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,580
Grandpa.

163
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Where are you?

164
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,580
It's true.

165
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
You're still alive.

166
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
Leon, don't.

167
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
It's dangerous.

168
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Grandpa.

169
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:14,580
What should I do?

170
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
The fire is getting bigger.

171
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Grandpa.

172
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,580
Leon, stop.

173
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,580
You have to get out of here.

174
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
It's dangerous.

175
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
Grandpa.

176
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,580
I want to free him.

177
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Please, get out of here.

178
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
Hey.

179
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,580
Don't do that.

180
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
Don't hurt him.

181
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Let him go.

182
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
He's just a kid.

183
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Don't hurt him.

184
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,580
Please, don't hurt him.

185
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Leon.

186
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
Grandpa.

187
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,580
Leon.

188
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,580
This is a punishment for the intruder.

189
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
I want to free him.

190
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Adam.

191
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,580
Leon, Orion's grandson tried to break into our fire prison.

192
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
What?

193
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,580
What are you doing?

194
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Why did a kid like you get into the prison?

195
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
We're sorry, sir.

196
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,580
Then, did he meet Orion?

197
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
No, sir.

198
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,580
We managed to catch Leon.

199
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,580
Good.

200
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
From now on,

201
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
be careful.

202
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Don't let Orion and Leon get away.

203
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Yes, sir.

204
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Am I right, sir?

205
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,580
We've lost.

206
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
And Leon knows everything.

207
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,580
We have to be more careful with Ankara.

208
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
This is useless.

209
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,580
If this continues, I'll run out of energy.

210
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,580
I have to come up with a strategy.

211
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,580
He...

212
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
He has to be trapped.

213
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,580
The Power Barrier.

214
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Catch that shadow.

215
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Catch the shadow.

216
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:58,580
Good.

217
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,580
The power of the power.

218
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Where is it?

219
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Calome.

220
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
I'm here.

221
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
This heart...

222
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
...is not mine.

223
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Hold this.

224
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
Call Alfa.

225
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
Yes, sir.

226
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,580
Finally, I managed to catch this annoying creature.

227
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,580
Okay.

228
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,580
I have to go see him.

229
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm here.

230
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Hide.

231
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,580
And the last one is...

232
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
...the black owl.

233
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,580
What is this?

234
00:15:52,580 --> 00:16:00,580
This creature...

235
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,580
...will make the 8th Pingisan's king.

236
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:10,580
I can take his legs.

237
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:22,580
What are you doing?

238
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,580
Sir.

239
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,580
You scared me.

240
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,580
What are you doing?

241
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
Sir.

242
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,580
This...

243
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
I'm making a potion to increase stamina.

244
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,580
I made it especially for you.

245
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:54,580
Why?

246
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
It doesn't smell good.

247
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,580
It's called Jahamut.

248
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
Nothing smells good, sir.

249
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:16,580
Sir.

250
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,580
Why did you destroy it?

251
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,580
You, Fik.

252
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,580
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.

253
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,580
You want to give me up, right?

254
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
Sir.

255
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Don't judge me like that.

256
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
You got it wrong.

257
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,580
I'm going to destroy you.

258
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
So, you can't go back to school.

259
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,580
And tell everyone that Alfa is a traitor.

260
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Get ready.

261
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,580

Try to break the sword.

276
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:25,580
What do you mean, sir?

277
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,580
What did you say?

278
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,580
Now.

279
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,580
You push the sword to the soul stone.

280
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,580
I tried it, but it didn't work.

281
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
Why me, sir?

282
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
If the prince can't do it, why me?

283
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Alfa.

284
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Your destiny is tied to the eighth hand.

285
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Since you were born, you've made the eighth prince lose his power.

286
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Because of that, I'm sure...

287
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,580
...only you can destroy the eighth prince's soul stone.

288
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:07,580

Sir.

309
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
Sir, wake up.

310
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Sir, what's wrong?

311
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
Sir.

312
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Wow, you're awake.

313
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
You didn't even sleep.

314
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,580
The eighth prince can't do it.

315
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,580
Let's go.

316
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Sir.

317
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,580
Sir, you can't do it.

318
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,580
Wake up.

319
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
Sir.

320
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,580
So, I can take your leg?

321
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
Yes.

322
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:43,580
Very good.

323
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,580
We've destroyed the first soul stone.

324
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Yes.

325
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,580
Hey.

326
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Jambu Batu, Fruit Pineapple.

327
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
Destroyed one.

328
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
There are still 11.

329
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
We're still in the middle.

330
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
Wow, that's beautiful.

331
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,580
Our journey is still long.

332
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,580
Kids, we can't give up.

333
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Now, it's time to find the second soul stone.

334
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Where is the second soul stone, sir?

335
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
The second soul stone...

336
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
is controlled by a creature...

337
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
named Bati.

338
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,580
It's a dragon.

339
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,580
It's a dragon, Ben.

340
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
It's not a dragon.

341
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
It's a serpent.

342
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Enough.

343
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Don't joke.

344
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,580
This is a serious matter.

345
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Help!

346
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,580
What's going on?

347
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,580
Help!

348
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
A bomb.

349
00:21:48,580 --> 00:22:02,580
Help!

350
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,580
Sir!

351
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
What's going on?

352
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
There's a bomb.

353
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
Help!

354
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Who's that?

355
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Help!

356
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
I'm hungry.

357
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Help!

358
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:34,580
I'm hungry.

359
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,580
A dragon?

360
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,580
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,580
I'm hungry.

362
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
Sir.

364
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,580
He's a female demon.

365
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
His brother is Barga.

366
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,580
That's scary.

367
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,580
Barga is a male demon.

368
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,580
While Barga is a female demon.

369
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,580
It's easier for a woman to be a demon, right?

370
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
Yes.

371
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,580
So, it's weaker.

372
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,580
Wait.

373
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,580
Barga is more fierce than Barga.

374
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,580
And he's 10 times stronger than Barga.

375
00:23:33,580 --> 00:24:03,580
I'm hungry.

376
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:14,580
You're a slug.

377
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Where is he now?

378
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Where is Barga now?

379
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:40,580
It's huge.

380
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,580
Is that a big slug or a small slug?

381
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,580
It can be a slug.

382
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,580
Yes, especially a slug.

383
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
It's a holiday.

384
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
Do you see that?

385
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
It's a slug.

386
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
What's in it?

387
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:07,580
Oh my God.

388
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:14,580
He's in danger. We have to help him.

389
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
I'm scared.

390
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,580
He's in danger. We have to help him.

391
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I'm scared.

392
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
He's a slug.

393
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,580
We have to go there.

394
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,580
Professor, let me accompany the kid.

395
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
Kids, get ready.

396
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Let's go.

397
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:43,580
Leon, Leon.

398
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
I'm okay.

399
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Leon, my grandson.

400
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,580
Leon.

401
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,580
Grandpa.

402
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,580
Grandpa, is this really you?

403
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Yes, it's me.

404
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
I'm dreaming, right?

405
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
No, you're not dreaming.

406
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,580
You're in the same prison as me.

407
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,580
In the fire prison.

408
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,580
Grandpa.

409
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Leon, my grandson.

410
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
I miss you, Leon.

411
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
I miss you, Grandpa.

412
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,580
Grandpa. / Yes.

413
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Forgive me.

414
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
I can't help you.

415
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,580
No, I'm the one who should apologize to you.

416
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,580
Because you're suffering in this prison.

417
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
It's okay, Grandpa.

418
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
I'm happy wherever I am.

419
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
As long as you're here.

420
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,580
I want to be with you, Leon.

421
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Grandpa.

422
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,580
You promised that we can get out of here.

423
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Yes, we have to get out.

424
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
Grandpa.

425
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Kids, are you ready to fly?

426
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
Yes.

427
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Get your lollipop ready.

428
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,580
We're going to fight against the Bargi monster.

429
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,580
Okay. / Ready?

430
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
One, two, three.

431
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Three, two, one.

432
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Let's count to three and fly.

433
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,580
One, two, three.

434
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Now!

435
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:58,580
That feeling.

436
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,580
I saw a ghost.

437
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,580
What if it's just a dream?

438
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,580
But it hurts so much.

439
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:20,580
A ghost.

440
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:27,580
So, this is not a dream.

441
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,580
You're my future husband.

442
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,580
My future husband.

443
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:50,580
This is the power of Megatron.

444
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,580
I don't understand what you mean.

445
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Calm down.

446
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Let me read your mind.

447
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Don't hurt her.

448
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Don't hurt her. Let her go.

449
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,580
She's just a kid.

450
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,580
Don't hurt her.

451
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,580
Leon.

452
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Leon is in danger.

453
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,580
I have to go there.

454
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:46,580
Bargi headquarters?

455
00:29:46,580 --> 00:30:11,580
Professor Rita.

456
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Professor Libaran.

457
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Hi.

458
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
You're smiling, Professor Aldebaran.

459
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,580
I'm sorry.

460
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,580
I got hurt because of my children.

461
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
They're in love.

462
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,580
So, I was attacked by my own magic.

463
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,580
Okay.

464
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,580
Take Titan to the clinic.

465
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
I have to go.

466
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Where are you going, Professor Aldebaran?

467
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,580
I'm going to the fire prison.

468
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
The fire prison?

469
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Why are you going there?

470
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,580
I have to save Leon.

471
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,580
He's in the fire prison...

472
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,580
...because he tried to save his leg.

473
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Professor Aldebaran.

474
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
I can't just sit here.

475
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,580
While Scorsese is being attacked, I'm going to help.

476
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Don't, Professor. This is dangerous.

477
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Because this is dangerous, I'm going to accompany you.

478
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Okay, then.

479
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Titan, Yasmin, you take care of the school.

480
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
Okay, Professor.

481
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,580
Professor Aldebaran, we should go.

482
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,580
I'm going to use the lollipop.

483
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
Don't, Purwa.

484
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
We can't use the lollipop.

485
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580
Why, Professor?

486
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,580
Because the fire guard can sense our arrival.

487
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
What should we do now?

488
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,580
The fire guard can't see.

489
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,580
He can only sense our presence.

490
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,580
We have to turn ourselves into animals.

491
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Animals?

492
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:59,580
My husband's candidate.

493
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,580
My husband's candidate?

494
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
What kind of dream is this?

495
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,580
I can't believe I'm meeting you like this.

496
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Where is he going?

497
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,580
That's not important.

498
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,580
What's important is that I have to leave this place.

499
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
But how?

500
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,580
I'm going to use the magic of the place's divinity.

501
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
The divinity...

502
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,580
of my husband.

503
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
Where is my husband?

504
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Where is he?

505
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
He's my husband.

506
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Finally.

507
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Okay, I have to take him.

508
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:15,580
I'm going to make it this time.

509
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Eat this.

510
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,580
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,580
I'm not hungry.

512
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
Eat this.

513
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:52,580
I said I'm not hungry. I want to go home.

514
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
It hurts.

515
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,580
What's that monster?

516
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:18,580
Do you want to be my husband?

517
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,580
Do you want to marry me?

518
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Marry?

519
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:53,580
Where is the monster? I want to see him.

520
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
Eat vinegar and tofu.

521
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
I don't know either.

522
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,580
Guys, let's go to my house.

523
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,580
Who knows, my husband might run away...

524
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
and come back to his house.

525
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,580
Okay? -Okay.

526
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,580
Also, check on my condition and your condition.

527
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:18,580
Is there anyone who can help me?

528
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,580
I'm going to be left behind.

529
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:30,580
Mr. Panji!

530
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:40,580
There's no one here.

531
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
I think there's no one here.

532
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Wait.

533
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
Be quiet.

534
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,580
I think it's from that way.

535
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,580
I heard a music.

536
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,580
Music from that room.

537
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,580
That's my room.

538
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Where is it?

539
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:13,580
It's from that room.

540
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Let's go.

541
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Why not?

542
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
That's my uncle's dirty clothes.

543
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
That's right. It stinks.

544
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
Let's wear our clothes and go there.

545
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,580
My dirty clothes?

546
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
It stinks?

547
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
Instead of throwing up, we can throw up.

548
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,580
How can I be that dirty?

549
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,580
I thought I'm the only one who's dirty.

550
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,580
Let's go there.

551
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Wait for me here.

552
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:54,580
If you're angry, eat this.

553
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,580
Hurry up. Don't use your hands.

554
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:05,580
I'm sorry, sir.

555
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
We have to lie to you.

556
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,580
Because Mr. Panji told us to keep this a secret from anyone.

557
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
For the sake of my mother and father.

558
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,580
What's wrong?

559
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Let's go, sir.

560
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:37,580
Why is it like this?

561
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,580
Oh no.

562
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,580
Music from that room.

563
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:59,580
The infusion is always active.

564
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,580
What infusion?

565
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,580
There's an infusion that always makes my parents angry.

566
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,580
I thought the person is a criminal.

567
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,580
But, the professor is on our side.

568
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,580
But, he's not the one who infuses the medicine.

569
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,580
That's right.

570
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Who else could it be?

571
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Why does it take so long for Alfa and Vega to come?

572
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
They said it's only a short time.

573
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,580
Is it really in the place where I keep my dirty clothes?

574
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Yes.

575
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
It smells.

576
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Yes.

577
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
Can we throw up?

578
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Yes.

579
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Wait for me here.

580
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
I'll be right back.

581
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
I know.

582
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,580
Don't eat meat with me.

583
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,580
Don't be a coward, Megantara.

584
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,580
You're such a coward.

585
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,580
How dare you call Megantara a coward.

586
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
Who's a coward?

587
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
What's next?

588
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,580
It's so sour.

589
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,580
Why does it take so long for Alfa and Vega to come?

590
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,580
Can we throw up?

591
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,580
I mean, can we drink coffee?

592
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Can we eat meat?

593
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
Can we?

594
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Here, wear the glasses.

595
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
It's so hard to wear the glasses now.

596
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
The glasses are from the 8th floor.

597
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,580
We have to wear the glasses so we can know...

598
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,580
...that there's a sorcerer who wants to infiltrate our prison.

599
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:02,580
That's the prison.

600
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,580
Remember, never change into a human.

601
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,580
If you do, the guards will arrest us.

602
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Daniel, what he's doing is too much.

603
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
He's bothering your powerless parents.

604
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Yes, that's why I'm so mad at him.

605
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,580
And I have to find the sorcerer.

606
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,580
"The Sorcerer"

607
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Who's that?

608
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
Why is no one here?

609
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,580
"The Sorcerer"

610
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:56,580
What's that?

611
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,580
It's a letter.

612
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Let me see.

613
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,580
"The Sorcerer"

614
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
The headquarters of the Barji...

615
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:46,580
According to our rules, the loser...

616
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,580
...has to follow the winner's wishes.

617
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:57,580
"The Sorcerer"

618
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:07,580
Let's go inside.

619
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
Get ready, Professor.

620
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:16,580
There's an intruder!

621
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,580
Let's attack!

622
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,580
"The Sorcerer"

623
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:28,580
This is a good chance.

624
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Since the Dark Lord is unconscious, I have to get rid of him.

625
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:40,580
Nara.

626
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,580
What are you doing?

627
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,580
Agni.

628
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,580
Don't tell me you're going to make a mistake again.

629
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,580
I'm currently curing the Dark Lord.

630
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,580
Who knows, he might faint because he's tired.

631
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
I'll cure his legs.

632
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:11,580
Yes, get in.

633
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Yes.

634
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Thank you.

635
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,580
Ankara!

636
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,580
Attack!

637
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:29,580
What's wrong, sir?

638
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Nothing, sir.

639
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
I'll take care of it.

640
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
I'm a sorcerer.

641
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,580
I won't let you pass.

642
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,580
Now, sir.

643
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,580
Here I come!

644
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,580
"The Sorcerer"

645
00:43:46,580 --> 00:44:08,580
Merik!

646
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,580
No.

647
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
Don't.

648
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,580
We still need them.

649
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,580
I have a better idea.

650
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,580
What is it, Professor?

651
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:32,580
I agree, Professor.

652
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Let's bring them.

653
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
Come on.

654
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,580
"The Sorcerer"

655
00:44:43,580 --> 00:45:03,580
Did you meet your parents?

656
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
Yes, I did.

657
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
They're okay.

658
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,580
But, there's a snitch.

659
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,580
A snitch?

660
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,580
Listen.

661
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
What are you talking about?

662
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
Stop whining.

663
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,580
I'm not invited.

664
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,580
Bye, sir.

665
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,580
You can invite us if you want.

666
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,580
I want to know.

667
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,580
I'm tired.

668
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
Where did you get the clue?

669
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
A snitch came into the room.

670
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,580
I found this map on the snitch.

671
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,580
What does this map say?

672
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:52,580
It's morning.

673
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,580
Let's go there.

674
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
Okay.

675
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
Wait.

676
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
Think.

677
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,580
This could be a trap.

678
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,580
"The Sorcerer"

679
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,580
What if it's not a trap?

680
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
That's right.

681
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,580
I think we should follow him.

682
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,580
We don't know where the base is.

683
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
We have to save him.

684
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
That's right.

685
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,580
We have to go there.

686
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,580
That's right.

687
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,580
Wait.

688
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,580
Let's think.

689
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,580
Let's go to the school.

690
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,580
Okay.

691
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,580
But, remember.

692
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,580
We have to be careful.

693
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,580
Okay.

694
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:51,580
Let's go.

695
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,580
Kneel.

696
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,580
It seems safe.

697
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,580
Now, we have to go out.

698
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,580
"The Sorcerer"

699
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:26,580
We did it.

700
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,580
Let's go in.

701
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,580
Let's go in now.

702
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,580
Okay.

703
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:47,580
We're here.

704
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,580
Where is the base?

705
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,580
Let's go around.

706
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,580
If the map is correct, we're not far from here.

707
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,580
Okay.

708
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,580
I'll go first.

709
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,580
You guys, follow me.

710
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:15,580
I'm confused.

711
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,580
Who is the sorcerer?

712
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,580
I think...

713
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,580
...he's our age.

714
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,580
What?

715
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,580
Our age?

716
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,580
He's still a kid.

717
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,580
Yes.

718
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,580
I heard a voice in my parents' room.

719
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,580
It can't be a kid.

720
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,580
He's so strong.

721
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,580
He can destroy the ground.

722
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
Mr. Panji, where is he?

723
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,580
I don't know.

724
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,580
Here.

725
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,580
What?

726
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,580
What can't you do?

727
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,580
You guys are always noisy.

728
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,580
I'm not asking you to do anything.

729
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,580
What can't you do?

730
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,580
We're confused.

731
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,580
You said you're confused.

732
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,580
What can't you do?

733
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,580
You're so slow.

734
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,580
Let's go.

735
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
Come on, girls.

736
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
I'm a sorcerer.

737
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:23,580
That's...

738
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,580
That's Mr. Bargi.

739
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,580
He's in the headquarters.

740
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,580
Did you hear that?

741
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,580
There's a sorcerer.

742
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,580
He's a coward.

743
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,580
He's so strong.

744
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,580
Don't be afraid.

745
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,580
Who's afraid?

746
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,580
We're not afraid.

747
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,580
Maybe your soldiers are afraid.

748
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,580
You're a kid.

749
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,580
You're the one who's afraid.

750
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,580
There's Mr. Bargi.

751
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,580
Bye.

752
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,580
The headquarters is near.

753
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:13,580
You're kidding, right?

754
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,580
Bargi is getting married.

755
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,580
Okay.

756
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,580
Let go of my hand.

757
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,580
Okay.

758
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,580
Here's the thing.

759
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:36,580
I want to tell you that getting married is a hassle.

760
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,580
Because we have to prepare a lot of things.

761
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,580
For example, we have to have a wedding.

762
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,580
We have to prepare a wedding.

763
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,580
We have to prepare a wedding dress.

764
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,580
We have to save a lot of money.

765
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,580
And one more thing.

766
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,580
We have to do the job.

767
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,580
I'm a waitress.

768
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,580
I don't have a job.

769
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
So, don't worry about me.

770
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,580
Bargi is getting married.

771
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:12,580
Okay.

772
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,580
Agni.

773
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,580
Why did you take my daughter?

774
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:24,580
What weapon did you use?

775
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,580
What weapon?

776
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,580
Don't lie.

777
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,580
Agni.

778
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,580
Agni, click.

779
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,580
Agni.

780
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,580
What is this?

781
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,580
That's...

782
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
a foot-puller.

783
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,580
You're going to take the blood of the 8th prince with this, right?

784
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,580
Right?

785
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,580
Why?

786
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,580
Agni.

787
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,580
A foot-puller.

788
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,580
To take the blood of the 8th prince.

789
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,580
How could you?

790
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
You're a teacher, but how?

791
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,580
I don't trust you.

792
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,580
Don't lie.

793
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,580
Agni.

794
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,580
As long as you know...

795
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,580
I used that...

796
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
to take the hair of the 8th prince.

797
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,580
There are a lot of hair.

798
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,580
Who knows that's what makes him weak.

799
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,580
He easily faints.

800
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,580
There are a lot of bacteria in his hair.

801
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,580
We have to take it off.

802
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,580
Liar.

803
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,580
I don't trust you.

804
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,580
Liar.

805
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:45,580
So, you're the one who's going to fight.

806
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,580
Alright.

807
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,580
How about we make a rule?

808
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,580
The one who wins...

809
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:54,580
will follow the rule.

810
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,580
How?

811
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,580
Who's scared?

812
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
Hey, you guys.

813
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:08,580
Now it's your turn to guard here.

814
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,580
Alright.

815
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,580
I'm heading there.

816
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,580
Yes.

817
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,580
Alright.

818
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,580
You guys guard here.

819
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,580
We'll follow the rule.

820
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,580
Alright.

821
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
We'll guard here.

822
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:25,580
Professor.

823
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,580
I thought we knew each other.

824
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,580
Don't lie.

825
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,580
We'll keep on walking.

826
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:39,580
What's this?

827
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,580
You lost, Agni.

828
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,580
According to our rule...

829
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,580
the loser...

830
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,580
has to follow the winner's will.

831
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,580
Alright.

832
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,580
Now...

833
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,580
what do I have to do?

834
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:12,380
Hi Hi Hi Hi

835
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,380
depth of consciousness

836
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:29,380
Beware guys, Vega!

837
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:36,380
Vega, you're okay right?

838
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,380
yes, Vega, are you okay?

839
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,380
what's wrong, papa?

840
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,380
you've saved me

841
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,380
no, I haven't

842
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,380
you haven't done anything

843
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:52,380
yes, that's right

844
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,380
it's not Alfa who saved you, Vega

845
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:00,380
but, but who?

846
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,380
I don't know either

847
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,380
but if I look closely

848
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,380
the light is coming from those bushes

849
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:28,380
beware, Vega

850
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,380
the light is coming from those bushes

851
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:54,380
attack!

852
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,380
Leo, bring the other team, quick!

853
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,380
yes!

854
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:24,380
open the cell

855
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,380
for what?

856
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,380
we will bring Orion and Leon to the 8th prince

857
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,380
because they will get the death sentence tonight

858
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,380
right

859
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,380
this is the direct order from the 8th prince

860
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,380
yes, sir

861
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:52,380
what should we do, Kate?

862
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,380
we will be sentenced to death

863
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,380
Leon, you have to run

864
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,380
so that grandpa will be punished

865
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,380
no, I don't want to leave him

866
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,380
I want to be here with him

867
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:20,380
what's wrong with me?

868
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,380
good evening, prince

869
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,380
how can I sleep here?

870
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,380
yes, you fainted

871
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:35,380
now, I want to do a cleansing ritual for you

872
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,380
are you ready?

873
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,380
let's start

874
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,380
I will give you a cleansing ritual

875
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,380
are you ready?

876
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,380
let's start

877
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:54,380
what are you doing?

878
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,380
you fainted, right?

879
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,380
it's because of the bacteria on your feet

880
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,380
so that you won't faint easily

881
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,380
I will cleanse you

882
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,380
are you ready?

883
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,380
take a deep breath

884
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,380
hold it

885
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,380
let's start

886
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,380
the other foot

887
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,380
right

888
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,380
one

889
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,380
two

890
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,380
three

891
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:27,380
wait, it's not done yet

892
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,380
again

893
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,380
let him finish it

894
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,380
it hurts

895
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,380
finally, it's done

896
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,380
I got the eight-legged owl

897
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,380
yes

898
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,380
what's wrong?

899
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
hello

900
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,380
yes, it's true

901
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,380
there's someone there

902
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,380
and he saved me

903
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,380
don't tell me that person is the same person

904
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,380
who gave the map of the bargy headquarters

905
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,380
but we still have to be careful

906
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,380
who knows

907
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,380
that person has evil intentions

908
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:35,380
hold it

909
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,380
give me the stone

910
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:45,380
I will check this stone

911
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,380
scanning the stone

912
00:59:49,380 --> 01:00:03,380
it's safe

913
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,380
this stone is just a normal stone

914
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,380
there's no magic in it

915
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,380
then, can I keep it for later?

916
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:22,380
hello

917
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,380
is there anyone?

918
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,380
hello

919
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,380
hey, come out

920
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,380
don't hide, come out, good person

921
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:37,380
even though you're a good person, you have to make it beautiful

922
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,380
come with us

923
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,380
let us go

924
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,380
calm down, Orion

925
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,380
this is me, Aldebaran

926
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,380
Aldebaran?

927
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,380
yes, this is me, Aldebaran

928
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,380
and that's Professor Tumba

929
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,380
we will set you free

930
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,380
but you have to calm down

931
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,380
don't panic

932
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,380
we will catch you

933
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,380
understand?

934
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,380
let's go

935
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:21,380
that looks like a magician

936
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:28,380
what are you doing?

937
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:34,380
I'm sorry for disturbing you

938
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,380
what's wrong?

939
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,380
I want to ask

940
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:42,380
did you order the two supervisors to release Orion and Lel?

941
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,380
don't joke

942
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,380
I never ordered that

943
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,380
but the two supervisors told me

944
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,380
there must be a magician

945
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,380
hurry, catch the magician

946
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,380
yes, sir

947
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,380
hey, Mr. Niran

948
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,380
now, Mr. Niran's leg

949
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,380
ready

950
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:11,380
one, two, three

Don't fall, okay?

It hurts here.

Why?

Why are you like this?

No, actually, you're healthier now.

1010
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Because all the bacteria are gone.

1011
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,960
Now I want to throw it away, okay?

We will trade souls again with these officers.

There are so many of them.

I'll calm you down, Leon.
