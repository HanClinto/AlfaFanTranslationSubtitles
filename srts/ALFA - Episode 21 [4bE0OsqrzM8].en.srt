 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 What's this, Prof?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 It seems like someone has changed the tool of victory into a tool of displacement

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 What has that tool moved?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Somewhere else

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 That we don't know where

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I found our professor behind the wall

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 In the room

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Behind the wall?

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 The prince of darkness and darkness

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 The prince of darkness and darkness

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 He even has a heart of gold

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Drink that, prince

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And get your power

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 What is this?

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 The prince!

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 The prince!

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I don't want to be defeated like my father and mother

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Father, mother

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Please help me

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Father, mother

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Please help me

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 The prince of darkness and darkness

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 The prince of darkness and darkness

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 The prince of darkness and darkness

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 The prince!

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 The prince!

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Father, mother

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Help me

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 We will help you, father

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 The prince of darkness and darkness

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The prince of darkness and darkness

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 All of you want to fight me?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Help me!

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Help me!

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Alpha, you better leave this place

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Why do you have to help me now?

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Father, mother

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Hurry, Alpha

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 We can't hold on any longer

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Alpha, only you can save us

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 We can't hold on any longer

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We can't hold on any longer

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 We can't hold on any longer

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Alpha, only you can save us

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 You have to jump now

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Only you can save the prince of darkness

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Let's go, Alpha

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Hurry!

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Help me, father

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Mother

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Help me, father

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Alpha, help me

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 [music intensifies]

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 [yells]

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Ugh.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 What?

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Again, that kid succeeded in you.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Angkara.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 How far is the end of this cliff?

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I don't know, sir.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 But with this high cliff, he shouldn't be safe.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 [snores]

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 [snores]

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Like a soldier.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Where are you going, Vega?

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Where are you going, sir?

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Wait, I want to ask this telescope.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Oh, Vega.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Don't you see?

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 The teachers are busy.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 It's not good to disturb them.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But you know what's dangerous.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 You should be careful.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You're right.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Okay, you want to come with us?

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Vita, do you want to come with us?

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Okay, let's go.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 But what about the teacher?

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Just leave him alone.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Let's go.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 [music intensifies]

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 [footsteps]

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Why are you still awake?

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 We can't sleep because we're thinking about Alva.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Oh, right.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Soldier.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Can you fix this telescope?

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 The clothes are torn.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 The damage is severe.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 It can't be fixed.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Professor Purwa.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Is it possible for you to fix this?

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 That's none of your business.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 There's one person who can.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 His name is Panji.

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 He's a magician repairman.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But his place is very far from here.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 In the bush.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It's okay, Professor.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Even though it's far,

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 the important thing is that the telescope can be fixed.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Yes, because we want to find Alva.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The bush is a dangerous place.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 There are ball monsters there.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Ball monsters can turn into anything.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 He can absorb your fear.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 We're not afraid, Professor.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 We'll still fight him.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Because we want to save Alva.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Right, guys?

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Yes.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 We're not afraid.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 You are true friends.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Friends who are always there when your friends are in trouble.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 You are always there when you are happy and sad.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I'm amazed and proud of you.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Professor.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Let me accompany these children.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 To go to the bush that is very dangerous.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Don't, Megantara.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I need your help to build this school.

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 To help the teachers.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Yes.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 We don't need an army.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 We'll go alone.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 The important thing is that we must always be united.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Right, guys?

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Yes.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Are you sure?

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Professor.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I will train them first.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 The mantra to destroy the ball monsters.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Okay.

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Rai, Vega, Pelita.

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Please pay attention.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 As soon as I open this bag.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 A monster will come out.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Or something that will scare you.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 How to make you not afraid?

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 It's easy.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Don't have any fear in you.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Understand?

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 In this lesson.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 You must imagine something funny...

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 ...when you see something scary.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 You know?

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Okay.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Then, recite this mantra.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 When you recite this mantra.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Something that scares you will become funny.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Very funny.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And if you laugh, the monster will...

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 ...defeat you.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Understand?

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Yes, sir.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Good.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 First, I will give you a chance.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Rai.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 What will you see when you see this?

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 This ball.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 My people.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 My people.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Why do I have to be afraid?

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Rai, don't be afraid. Just attack.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 What should I do?

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 What should I do?

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Why are you afraid?

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I told you.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Imagine something funny.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 What's so hard about that?

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Concentrate.

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Mr. Medi.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Mr. Medi.

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Good, Rai.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Look.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 The people of Dangdutan.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 There's no Dangdutan monster.

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Yes.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I did it.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 You did it, Rai.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Good.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Yes.

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Very good.

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Okay.

201
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 The second one.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's your turn, Fiko.

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Yes, sir.

204
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Let's see.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 What will come out of this bag?

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Professor Purwa.

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 It's easy. I'm not afraid.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 That's good.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Vega.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 You're my student.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Good.

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 You won't pass my class.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 I'll make sure of that.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 No, Professor Purwa.

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 I don't want to leave the class.

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 When Professor Purwa came, you said it's easy.

217
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Now, you're saying it's easy.

218
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Come on.

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Concentrate.

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You're the smartest student.

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 You'll answer all the questions.

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Yes, Vega.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Yes, sir.

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Are you afraid?

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 You're not afraid of monsters.

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 You're afraid of the value of money.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Imagine that.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 It's funny.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Come on.

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Imagine it's funny.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Vega.

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Wait.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I'm scared.

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I'm a medic.

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Vega.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Professor Purwa is a goddess.

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Professor Purwa is famous.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 He's cruel.

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 He's teaching.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Now, he's weak.

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Like a boneless meat.

242
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 You're the best.

243
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 You're the best.

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 You're the best.

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Okay.

246
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Next.

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 You're a good boy.

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Come on.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Move forward.

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Come on.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I want to succeed.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Let's open the bag.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 What will you be afraid of?

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Concentrate.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 [Vega, you're a monster.]

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 [You're a monster.]

257
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 [You're a monster.]

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 [You're a monster.]

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 [You're a monster.]

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 [You're a monster.]

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 [You're a monster.]

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 [You're a monster.]

263
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 [You're a monster.]

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 [You're a monster.]

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 [You're a monster.]

266
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 [You're a monster.]

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 [You're a monster.]

268
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You're a monster.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 You won't have a friend.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 You'd better go there.

271
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 You're in my family.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I don't want to.

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 I don't want to leave my friends.

274
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I don't want to.

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Pelita.

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Don't cry, Pelita.

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Concentrate.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Concentrate, Pelita.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Focus. Remember.

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Imagine.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 It's funny.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Try to remember.

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Try to use your dark powers.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Let's go.

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Uncle Mendy.

286
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 [The Dark Knight]

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 This is how the dark knights become like this.

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 What a sick, sick, loose, Jedi.

289
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Just like I said.

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 For you. Remember.

291
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 There's a rat eating rice.

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Focus and concentrate.

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 You'll succeed.

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Thank you, soldier.

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 But remember.

296
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 You have to be careful.

297
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And come back safe.

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Don't worry.

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 We'll be safe, soldier.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Rey can make a poem.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Good.

302
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 I can do it, soldier.

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Pelita.

304
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 You can make a poem like Uncle Megantara.

305
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Listen.

306
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 That's sweet.

307
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Don't cry. We'll be back safe.

308
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 [The Dark Knight]

309
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Good.

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 The beautiful bird that can see the water.

311
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 The most beautiful is Pelita.

312
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 [The Dark Knight]

313
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Vega, keep this.

314
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 What's this, sir?

315
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 That's a magic lamp.

316
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 When you're in trouble or lost,

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 you can turn on the lamp.

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And it can bring you back to your school.

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Okay, sir.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 This is a magic map.

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 This map will lead you to your destination.

322
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Keep it well.

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You three have to be careful and be careful.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Remember.

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 You have to focus and concentrate.

326
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Vega, this is the map.

327
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Rey, this is the map.

328
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Okay, sir.

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 We'll go now.

330
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Kids, you have to be careful.

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Kids, hurry back.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Sir!

333
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 [The Dark Knight]

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Vega, can you take Pelita and the lamp?

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Okay, sir.

336
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Vega, I'll give it to you.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Where are you going?

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I'll give it to you.

339
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 [The Dark Knight]

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Why are they gone?

341
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I'm jealous.

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Look at me.

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I'm going to be your team.

344
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Why do I have to be your team?

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Hey!

346
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Give it to me.

347
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Okay.

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I ran out of it.

349
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I'll fly to the sky.

350
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 I'm going to fly to the sky.

351
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 [The Dark Knight]

352
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 [The Dark Knight]

353
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 [The Dark Knight]

354
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 [The Dark Knight]

355
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I'm flying.

356
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Hey, I'm flying.

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Wait for me, Vega.

358
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Hey, Pelita.

359
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Wait for me.

360
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 [The Dark Knight]

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 [The Dark Knight]

362
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Guys, we're going to fly over the forest.

363
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Get ready to fly zigzag.

364
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 There are many tall trees.

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Okay, sir.

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 [The Dark Knight]

367
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 [The Dark Knight]

368
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 [The Dark Knight]

369
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 [The Dark Knight]

370
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Why are they flying zigzag?

371
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 It's like they're apologizing.

372
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Tole, you have to do it.

373
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 There's a car.

374
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Look.

375
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 There's a car.

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Ouch.

377
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Ouch.

378
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 My head is aching.

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 It hurts.

380
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Help me.

381
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I'm tired.

382
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I have to fight.

383
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Wait for me.

384
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 [The Dark Knight]

385
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 With these 12 souls...

386
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I will split my soul into 12.

387
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And I will kill...

388
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 the ones who dare to challenge me.

389
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 [The Dark Knight]

390
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 [The Dark Knight]

391
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 [The Dark Knight]

392
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 [The Dark Knight]

393
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 [The Dark Knight]

394
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 [The Dark Knight]

395
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 [The Dark Knight]

396
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 [The Dark Knight]

397
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 [The Dark Knight]

398
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I can change.

399
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Let's go.

400
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Guys.

401
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 We're at the swamp forest.

402
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Are you scared, Ray?

403
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 No.

404
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I'm not scared.

405
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 If I'm scared, why would I follow you?

406
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Let's go.

407
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Wait.

408
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I think we have to split.

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I and Vega will go to the right.

410
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 You go to the left.

411
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 What do you think?

412
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Let's go.

413
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I'm scared.

414
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I'm scared.

415
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 The forest is so deep.

416
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Ouch.

417
00:26:47,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Vega.

418
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Vlita.

419
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 You guys are...

420
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I'm scared.

421
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 There are so many of you.

422
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 I'm scared.

423
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 [The Dark Knight]

424
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Where am I?

425
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 It's so scary.

426
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 This house is so scary.

427
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Maybe...

428
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 This house is the darkest.

429
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I have to escape from here.

430
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Ouch. It hurts.

431
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 [The Dark Knight]

432
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Thank God you're awake.

433
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Why?

434
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 If you don't want to drink, it's okay.

435
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 But don't blame me if you're getting weak.

436
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 [The Dark Knight]

437
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 [The Dark Knight]

438
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 [The Dark Knight]

439
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 [The Dark Knight]

440
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 [The Dark Knight]

441
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 My blood is not flowing anymore.

442
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 That's good.

443
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Then who is it?

444
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Sir, who are you?

445
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And where am I?

446
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 This is my house.

447
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 I found you in the forest.

448
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And I think you're from a high place.

449
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Yes.

450
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Someone is evil to me.

451
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Wait for me.

452
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I'm coming.

453
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Alva.

454
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 You better get out of here.

455
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 No. You have to jump now.

456
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Sir.

457
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Come on, sir.

458
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Hurry, Alva.

459
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 We can't hold it any longer.

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 That's why I jumped from the cliff.

461
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Where are you from?

462
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I'm from Sihir School.

463
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Do you know the way to Sihir School?

464
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 I want to go home.

465
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I'm sorry. I don't know.

466
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I can't help you.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Because I can't leave here.

468
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 How about this?

469
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 For now, you stay here until you get better.

470
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 After you get better, I'll give you a map.

471
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And you can continue your journey home.

472
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Yes, sir.

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Just think of this house as your own.

474
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Take what you want.

475
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 But I only ask for one thing.

476
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 There's a grave next to this house.

477
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 With a black door.

478
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 You can't go in there without any reason.

479
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Yes, sir.

480
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 I promise.

481
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Good.

482
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 I'll do as you say.

483
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Who is this guy?

484
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 He looks nice.

485
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 But why is he living in a house like this?

486
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And there are so many people.

487
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Where are you going?

488
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 We can do this.

489
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 We can do this.

490
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Hey, guys.

491
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Lita.

492
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 How dare you?

493
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 You're so stubborn.

494
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 I've been waiting for you.

495
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 What's that?

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Look.

497
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 It's my team.

498
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 (I'm going to beat you up)

499
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 (You're going to get in trouble)

500
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 (I'm going to beat you up)

501
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 What are you thinking?

502
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Why are you so stubborn?

503
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 You're so stubborn.

504
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Come here, Samper.

505
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Come here.

506
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I'm sorry, ma'am.

507
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 I said, I'm sorry.

508
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 You're so stubborn.

509
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 You're just a foodie.

510
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 You're so stubborn.

511
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 It's not that far.

512
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 I think I heard someone.

513
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Me too.

514
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 But, it can't be Tol.

515
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Maybe it's a trap.

516
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 But I'm sure that it's Tol.

517
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 I think it's really Tol.

518
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 It's true.

519
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Let's go there.

520
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Come on.

521
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Wait.

522
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Wait for me.

523
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I promise.

524
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 I'll be back.

525
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 I think I heard Tol.

526
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I'll go to bed.

527
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 So, I can recover my energy.

528
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Let us go.

529
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Let us go.

530
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Who's that?

531
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Let us go.

532
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Let us go.

533
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Let us go.

534
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Let us go.

535
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Let us go.

536
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Let us go.

537
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Who's that?

538
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Help.

539
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Let us go.

540
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Let us go.

541
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Don't hurt us. Please let us go.

542
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Where are they coming from?

543
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Help.

544
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Let us go.

545
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Let us go.

546
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Let us go.

547
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Don't hurt us. Please let us go.

548
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Where are you going?

549
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Sir.

550
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 I heard someone asking for help.

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 From that door.

552
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Maybe it's just your hallucination.

553
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 You should go back to your room.

554
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Get some rest.

555
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Is it just my imagination?

556
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 I think I heard someone.

557
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Okay.

558
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I'll go back to my room.

559
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 "I'm sorry."

560
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Did you hear that?

561
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Yes, I heard it too.

562
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 I think it's coming from that direction.

563
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Let's go.

564
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 I'm sorry.

565
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 You should learn from your mistakes.

566
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 You think that's all you can do?

567
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 No.

568
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 I'm sorry.

569
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 I'm sorry.

570
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 I'm sorry.

571
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 I'm sorry.

572
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Who is that?

573
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Why is Tole so scared?

574
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 It must be a ball monster.

575
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Tole, don't cry.

576
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 I'm sorry.

577
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Tole, you should focus.

578
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 You should focus on that person.

579
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 And use your over-medicine.

580
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Come on.

581
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 I'm so tired.

582
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 I don't want to attack my own mother.

583
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 That's not your mother.

584
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 That's a ball monster.

585
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Yes, you're right.

586
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 You should focus.

587
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And use your over-medicine.

588
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Come on.

589
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Concentrate.

590
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 You can do it.

591
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 And imagine that your mother is funny.

592
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 You can do it.

593
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Come on.

594
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Concentrate.

595
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 I'm sorry.

596
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Over-medicine.

597
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 My mother is so beautiful.

598
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 And funny.

599
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 My mother is funny.

600
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 My mother is funny.

601
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Why did you disappear?

602
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Why did you disappear?

603
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Where did you go?

604
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 You guys...

605
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 You disappeared.

606
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Yes.

607
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 What are you doing here?

608
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 I...

609
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 I'm here to pick you up.

610
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 I want to join you.

611
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 You're scared of me, right?

612
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 You were sleeping last night.

613
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Yes.

614
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 You were sleeping last night.

615
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 You were snoring.

616
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Why?

617
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 You woke me up.

618
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 So, what are we going to do now?

619
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 We're going to Mr. Panji's house.

620
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 He can fix our telescope.

621
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 The broken one.

622
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Yes, you're right.

623
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Let's go.

624
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 I'm bored in my room.

625
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 What should I do?

626
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Oh, right.

627
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 He helped me.

628
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 I should pay him.

629
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 But...

630
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 What should I do?

631
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Well...

632
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 I'm here.

633
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Throw it.

 Yes, I did it.

637
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Javati, Bavaru.

638
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000

642

 Yes.

643
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 It's clean.

644
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 It looks neat.

645
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 It means, the labo is clean.

646
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Help!

647
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Let us go.

651

 I think I know that voice.

 But, why I don't know?

653
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 It looks like they're building another school.

654
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Stop them.

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:37,000

 Good morning, sir.

 Today, me and the teachers...

701
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 will build a school...

702
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 that was destroyed by the explosion.

703
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 And this school's improvement...

704
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 will take time and energy...

705
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 from the teachers.

706
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000

 on the school's improvement.

 to be vigilant.

735
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 Right? / Yes, sir.

 To open the eyes,

756
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 you have to press...

757
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 one of the cheekbones.

00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 Help me!

769
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 You found him!

770
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Sir!

771
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Sir! / Try to press it.

772
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 Why can't I do it?

773
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 Try to step back.

774
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Let the professor teach you.

775
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Like this, Tommy.

776
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 The other one, please.

777
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 You, please.

778
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 Are you ready?

779
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 Let's build our school.

780
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Yes, sir.

781
00:48:46,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 It looks like they're building another school, sir.

782
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Stop them, Anggar.

783
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 Doctor!

784
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Try to open your eyes.

785
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Hurry!

786
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 Let's finish the other one.

787
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 What?

788
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 Let's finish the other one.

789
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 Where are you going?

790
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 This forest is dangerous.

791
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 You better not play here.

792
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 We're going to this forest...

793
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 to find a resident here.

794
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 His name is Mr. Panji. Do you know him?

795
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 Yes, I do.

796
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 I don't want to be a part of this.

797
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 I want to live. Excuse me.

798
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 What does he mean?

799
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 Why is he going?

800
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 I don't know. He's running away.

801
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Let's go, sir.

802
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 I'm scared.

803
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Where am I going?

804
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 I have to help him.

805
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 What's that?

806
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 I'm going to lock you up.

807
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 Lock her up.

808
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 Lock her up.

809
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 To be continued...

810
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 To be continued...

811
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 To be continued...

812
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 We can do it!

813
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 To be continued...

814
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 We can do it!

815
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 Help!

816
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 Help!

817
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 Help!

818
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 Help!

819
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 Help!

820
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 Professor!

821
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 Can I help you for a moment?

822
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 Yes, Gantara.

823
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 The process of repairing the school has been completed.

824
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 If we stop it now, everything will be in vain.

825
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 To be continued...

826
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 To be continued...

827
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 I told you not to come near this cave.

828
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Not to mention opening the door and entering.

829
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 But what happened?

830
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 You've violated my advice.

831
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 And you've violated your own promise.

832
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 No.

833
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 I heard a voice asking for help.

834
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 Actually...

835
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 What is it?

836
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 That's none of your business.

837
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 If there's someone who's hiding there,

838
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 that's my business.

839
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 That's my business so that people can be safe.

840
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Actually, who are you to hide people like that?

841
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 You're probably...

842
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 a traitor!

843
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 If I'm a traitor, why would I save you?

844
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

845
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

846
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

847
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

848
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

849
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

850
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

851
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

852
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

853
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

854
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

855
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

856
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 Whatever! I should go home now.

857
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 I should go home now.

858
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 I should go home now.

859
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 I should go home now.

860
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 I should go home now.

861
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 I should go home now.

862
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 I should go home now.

863
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 The house is haunted.

864
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 The house is haunted.

865
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 The monsters are everywhere.

866
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 The monsters are everywhere.

867
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 The monsters are everywhere.

868
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 What's that?

869
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 What's that?

870
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 What's that?

871
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 Excuse me.

872
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 What's wrong with her?

873
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 Is this really Mr. Panji's house?

874
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 Yes.

875
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 I need your help.

876
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 Can you fix this telescope?

877
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 I can.

878
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 But I don't want to fix it.

879
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 Now, all of you leave.

880
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 Now, all of you leave.

881
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 Hurry up!

882
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 Hurry up!

883
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 Ghost!

884
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 Ghost!

885
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 Stop!

886
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 Stop!

887
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 Help me!

888
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 We have to help him!

889
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 But how?

890
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 I don't know.

891
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 You're stupid.

892
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have helped him.

893
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 But luckily, he didn't get in this room.

894
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 I have to change the key.

895
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 A painting patent.

896
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 From now on, if you want to open this door, you have to say the word.

897
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 Alfa.

898
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 Alfa.

899
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 Alfa.

900
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 That's the...

901
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 Alfa.

902
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 Alfa.

903
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 Alfa.

904
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 Alfa.

905
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 Alfa.

906
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 Alfa.

907
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 This is your food for the day.

908
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
 I'm hungry.

909
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 I've chanted the door...

910
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 ...with your names.

911
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 I've chanted the door...

912
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 ...with your names.

913
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 I've chanted the door...

914
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
 ...with your names.

915
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 I've chanted the door...

916
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 ...with your names.

917
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 I've chanted the door...

918
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 ...with your names.

919
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 I've chanted the door...

920
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 ...with your names.

921
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 I've chanted the door...

922
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
 ...with your names.

923
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 I've chanted the door...

924
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 ...with your names.

925
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 Please don't kill us.

926
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 Help!

927
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 We can do it!

928
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 We can do it!

929
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 We can do it!

930
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 Stop!

931
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 Guys, we have to help Jack.

932
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 We can't leave him.

933
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 But how? The monster is too high.

934
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
 You can fly.

935
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 Use the poppy.

936
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
 Okay.

937
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,000
 Get ready.

938
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 Fly!

939
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 Boss!

940
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 Boss!

941
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 Help!

942
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
 Help us!

943
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 Get ready to attack.

944
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 Attack!

945
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 Attack!

946
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 Help!

947
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 Attack!

948
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 Attack!

949
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 Attack!

950
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 Attack!

951
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 Attack!

952
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,000
 Attack!

953
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 Tommy, help Jack!

954
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 Jack!

955
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 Jack, go!

956
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 Jack!

957
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 Jack, come on!

958
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
 No!

959
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 Yes!

960
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 Thank you, Boss!

961
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 It's too high.

962
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 Wait!

963
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
 Hurry up!

964
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
 Attack!

965
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 Attack!

966
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 Attack!

967
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 Attack!

968
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
 We have to get out of here.

969
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 Be careful, Nick!

970
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:04,000
 Be careful, Nick!

971
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 Watch out, Nick!

972
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
 Watch out, Nick!

973
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 Help!

974
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 Tommy!

975
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 Professor!

976
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 Can I help Nick for a moment?

977
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 Don't be reckless.

978
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
 We're already focused.

979
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
 The school is already happening.

980
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 But Nick looks injured, Professor.

981
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 Don't be reckless.

982
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
 Nick is a strong kid.

983
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
 He can handle this.

984
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 We have to trust the kids.

985
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 We have to be sure.

986
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
 They can do it.

987
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 What's your next plan, Sir?

988
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 I want to fight back.

989
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
 There are people who have destroyed me.

990
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 And the first one...

991
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 ...is you.

992
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 What should I do, Sir?

993
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 We will do...

994
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 ...the attack of the missile.

995
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 Get ready.

996
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 [laughing]

997
01:04:38,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 Sir!

998
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 What's wrong with him?

999
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
 He's under attack.

1000
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
 Attack?

1001
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
 What attack?

1002
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 Judging from his attack,

1003
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
 I think he's under attack by a monster.

1004
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 Let's go.

1005
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
 Monster?

1006
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
 Don't tell me...

1007
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 Help!

1008
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 Help!

1009
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 Is he under attack by a monster?

1010
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 Yes, he is.

1011
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
 Don't go to the house in the middle of the forest.

1012
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
 The owner is a monster.

1013
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
 Be careful.

1014
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
 Help!

1015
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
 Help!

1016
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 Help!

1017
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 The house in the middle of the forest?

1018
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 No.

1019
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 That's his house.

1021
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 Guys,

1022
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 while Reptor is chasing Tommy, Jack, and Mike,

1023
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
 let's attack them from the side.

1024
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 There are so many people.

1025
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
 That's why we don't have to fight.

1026
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 What's wrong with you, Sir?

1027
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
 This is for fishing.

1028
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
 Don't eat it.
