1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What's this, Prof?

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It seems like someone has changed the tool of victory into a tool of displacement

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What has that tool moved?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Somewhere else

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That we don't know where

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I found our professor behind the wall

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the room

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Behind the wall?

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The prince of darkness and darkness

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He even has a heart of gold

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Drink that, prince

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And get your power

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What is this?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The prince!

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to be defeated like my father and mother

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Father, mother

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please help me

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Father, mother

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please help me

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The prince of darkness and darkness

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The prince!

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Father, mother

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Help me

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We will help you, father

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The prince of darkness and darkness

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All of you want to fight me?

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Help me!

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Alpha, you better leave this place

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why do you have to help me now?

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Father, mother

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hurry, Alpha

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We can't hold on any longer

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Alpha, only you can save us

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We can't hold on any longer

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Alpha, only you can save us

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You have to jump now

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Only you can save the prince of darkness

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go, Alpha

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hurry!

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Help me, father

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mother

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Help me, father

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Alpha, help me

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
[music intensifies]

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:52,000
[yells]

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Ugh.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Again, that kid succeeded in you.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Angkara.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How far is the end of this cliff?

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know, sir.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But with this high cliff, he shouldn't be safe.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:30,000
[snores]

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Like a soldier.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Where are you going, Vega?

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where are you going, sir?

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Wait, I want to ask this telescope.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, Vega.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't you see?

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The teachers are busy.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not good to disturb them.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But you know what's dangerous.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You should be careful.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're right.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, you want to come with us?

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Vita, do you want to come with us?

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, let's go.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But what about the teacher?

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just leave him alone.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
[music intensifies]

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
[footsteps]

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why are you still awake?

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We can't sleep because we're thinking about Alfa.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, right.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Soldier.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Can you fix this telescope?

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The clothes are torn.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The damage is severe.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It can't be fixed.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Professor Purwa.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Is it possible for you to fix this?

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's none of your business.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's one person who can.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
His name is Panji.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's a magician repairman.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But his place is very far from here.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
In the bush.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's okay, Professor.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Even though it's far,

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the important thing is that the telescope can be fixed.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, because we want to find Alfa.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The bush is a dangerous place.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There are ball monsters there.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ball monsters can turn into anything.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He can absorb your fear.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We're not afraid, Professor.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We'll still fight him.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Because we want to save Alfa.

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right, guys?

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We're not afraid.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You are true friends.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Friends who are always there when your friends are in trouble.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You are always there when you are happy and sad.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm amazed and proud of you.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Professor.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let me accompany these children.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
To go to the bush that is very dangerous.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't, Megantara.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I need your help to build this school.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
To help the teachers.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We don't need an army.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We'll go alone.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The important thing is that we must always be united.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Right, guys?

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you sure?

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Professor.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will train them first.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The mantra to destroy the ball monsters.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Rai, Vega, Pelita.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Please pay attention.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
As soon as I open this bag.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A monster will come out.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Or something that will scare you.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How to make you not afraid?

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's easy.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't have any fear in you.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Understand?

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
In this lesson.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You must imagine something funny...

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
...when you see something scary.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You know?

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then, recite this mantra.

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When you recite this mantra.

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Something that scares you will become funny.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Very funny.

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And if you laugh, the monster will...

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
...defeat you.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Understand?

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Good.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
First, I will give you a chance.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Rai.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What will you see when you see this?

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This ball.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:58,000
My people.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why do I have to be afraid?

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Rai, don't be afraid. Just attack.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What should I do?

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why are you afraid?

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I told you.

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Imagine something funny.

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's so hard about that?

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Concentrate.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Mr. Medi.

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Good, Rai.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Look.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The people of Dangdutan.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's no Dangdutan monster.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I did it.

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You did it, Rai.

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Good.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Very good.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay.

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The second one.

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's your turn, Fiko.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes, sir.

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's see.

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What will come out of this bag?

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Professor Purwa.

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's easy. I'm not afraid.

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's good.

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Vega.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're my student.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Good.

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You won't pass my class.

195
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll make sure of that.

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, Professor Purwa.

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't want to leave the class.

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
When Professor Purwa came, you said it's easy.

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Now, you're saying it's easy.

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Come on.

201
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Concentrate.

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're the smartest student.

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You'll answer all the questions.

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes, Vega.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes, sir.

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Are you afraid?

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're not afraid of monsters.

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You're afraid of the value of money.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Imagine that.

210
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's funny.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Come on.

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Imagine it's funny.

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Vega.

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm scared.

216
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm a medic.

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Vega.

218
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Professor Purwa is a goddess.

219
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Professor Purwa is famous.

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He's cruel.

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He's teaching.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Now, he's weak.

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like a boneless meat.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You're the best.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay.

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Next.

227
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're a good boy.

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Come on.

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Move forward.

230
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Come on.

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I want to succeed.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's open the bag.

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What will you be afraid of?

234
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Concentrate.

235
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
[Vega, you're a monster.]

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:29,000
[You're a monster.]

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You're a monster.

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You won't have a friend.

239
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You'd better go there.

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You're in my family.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't want to.

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't want to leave my friends.

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't want to.

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Pelita.

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't cry, Pelita.

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Concentrate.

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Concentrate, Pelita.

248
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Focus. Remember.

249
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Imagine.

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's funny.

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Try to remember.

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Try to use your dark powers.

253
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's go.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Uncle Mendy.

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
[The Dark Knight]

256
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is how the dark knights become like this.

257
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What a sick, sick, loose, Jedi.

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Just like I said.

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
For you. Remember.

260
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There's a rat eating rice.

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Focus and concentrate.

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You'll succeed.

263
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you, soldier.

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But remember.

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You have to be careful.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And come back safe.

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Don't worry.

268
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We'll be safe, soldier.

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Rey can make a poem.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Good.

271
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I can do it, soldier.

272
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Pelita.

273
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You can make a poem like Uncle Megantara.

274
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Listen.

275
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's sweet.

276
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Don't cry. We'll be back safe.

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
[The Dark Knight]

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Good.

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The beautiful bird that can see the water.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The most beautiful is Pelita.

281
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
[The Dark Knight]

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Vega, keep this.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What's this, sir?

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's a magic lamp.

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
When you're in trouble or lost,

286
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you can turn on the lamp.

287
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And it can bring you back to your school.

288
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay, sir.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This is a magic map.

290
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This map will lead you to your destination.

291
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Keep it well.

292
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You three have to be careful and be careful.

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Remember.

294
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You have to focus and concentrate.

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Vega, this is the map.

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Rey, this is the map.

297
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay, sir.

298
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We'll go now.

299
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Kids, you have to be careful.

300
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Kids, hurry back.

301
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sir!

302
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
[The Dark Knight]

303
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Vega, can you take Pelita and the lamp?

304
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay, sir.

305
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Vega, I'll give it to you.

306
00:19:41,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Where are you going?

307
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll give it to you.

308
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
[The Dark Knight]

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why are they gone?

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm jealous.

311
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Look at me.

312
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm going to be your team.

313
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why do I have to be your team?

314
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey!

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Give it to me.

316
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay.

317
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I ran out of it.

318
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll fly to the sky.

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm going to fly to the sky.

320
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
[The Dark Knight]

321
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm flying.

322
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hey, I'm flying.

323
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Wait for me, Vega.

324
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey, Pelita.

325
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wait for me.

326
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
[The Dark Knight]

327
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Guys, we're going to fly over the forest.

328
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Get ready to fly zigzag.

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There are many tall trees.

330
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay, sir.

331
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:56,000
[The Dark Knight]

332
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Why are they flying zigzag?

333
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's like they're apologizing.

334
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Tole, you have to do it.

335
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There's a car.

336
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Look.

337
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There's a car.

338
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ouch.

339
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
My head is aching.

340
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It hurts.

341
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Help me.

342
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm tired.

343
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I have to fight.

344
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Wait for me.

345
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
[The Dark Knight]

346
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:24,000
With these 12 souls...

347
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I will split my soul into 12.

348
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And I will kill...

349
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
the ones who dare to challenge me.

350
00:24:33,000 --> 00:25:20,000
[The Dark Knight]

351
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I can change.

352
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go.

353
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Guys.

354
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We're at the swamp forest.

355
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Are you scared, Ray?

356
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No.

357
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm not scared.

358
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If I'm scared, why would I follow you?

359
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Let's go.

360
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Wait.

361
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I think we have to split.

362
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I and Vega will go to the right.

363
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You go to the left.

364
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
What do you think?

365
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Let's go.

366
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm scared.

367
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The forest is so deep.

368
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Ouch.

369
00:26:47,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Vega.

370
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Vlita.

371
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You guys are...

372
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm scared.

373
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:18,000
There are so many of you.

374
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm scared.

375
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
[The Dark Knight]

376
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Where am I?

377
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's so scary.

378
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This house is so scary.

379
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Maybe...

380
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
This house is the darkest.

381
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I have to escape from here.

382
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Ouch. It hurts.

383
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
[The Dark Knight]

384
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Thank God you're awake.

385
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Why?

386
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If you don't want to drink, it's okay.

387
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But don't blame me if you're getting weak.

388
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:29,000
[The Dark Knight]

389
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
My blood is not flowing anymore.

390
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's good.

391
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Then who is it?

392
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Sir, who are you?

393
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And where am I?

394
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
This is my house.

395
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I found you in the forest.

396
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And I think you're from a high place.

397
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes.

398
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Someone is evil to me.

399
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Wait for me.

400
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm coming.

401
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Alfa.

402
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You better get out of here.

403
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No. You have to jump now.

404
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Sir.

405
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Come on, sir.

406
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Hurry, Alfa.

407
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We can't hold it any longer.

408
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's why I jumped from the cliff.

409
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Where are you from?

410
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm from Sihir School.

411
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Do you know the way to Sihir School?

412
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I want to go home.

413
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm sorry. I don't know.

414
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I can't help you.

415
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because I can't leave here.

416
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
How about this?

417
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
For now, you stay here until you get better.

418
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
After you get better, I'll give you a map.

419
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And you can continue your journey home.

420
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yes, sir.

421
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Just think of this house as your own.

422
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Take what you want.

423
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But I only ask for one thing.

424
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
There's a grave next to this house.

425
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
With a black door.

426
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You can't go in there without any reason.

427
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I promise.

429
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Good.

430
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'll do as you say.

431
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Who is this guy?

432
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
He looks nice.

433
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But why is he living in a house like this?

434
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And there are so many people.

435
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Where are you going?

436
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We can do this.

437
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, guys.

438
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Lita.

439
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
How dare you?

440
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You're so stubborn.

441
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I've been waiting for you.

442
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What's that?

443
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Look.

444
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's my team.

445
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
(I'm going to beat you up)

446
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
(You're going to get in trouble)

447
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
(I'm going to beat you up)

448
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What are you thinking?

449
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Why are you so stubborn?

450
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You're so stubborn.

451
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Come here, Samper.

452
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Come here.

453
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

454
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I said, I'm sorry.

455
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You're so stubborn.

456
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You're just a foodie.

457
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You're so stubborn.

458
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's not that far.

459
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I think I heard someone.

460
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Me too.

461
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But, it can't be Tol.

462
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Maybe it's a trap.

463
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But I'm sure that it's Tol.

464
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think it's really Tol.

465
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's true.

466
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's go there.

467
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Come on.

468
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Wait.

469
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Wait for me.

470
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I promise.

471
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll be back.

472
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I think I heard Tol.

473
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'll go to bed.

474
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So, I can recover my energy.

475
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Let us go.

476
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Who's that?

477
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Let us go.

478
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Who's that?

479
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Help.

480
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let us go.

481
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Don't hurt us. Please let us go.

482
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Where are they coming from?

483
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Help.

484
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Let us go.

485
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Don't hurt us. Please let us go.

486
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Where are you going?

487
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Sir.

488
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I heard someone asking for help.

489
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
From that door.

490
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Maybe it's just your hallucination.

491
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You should go back to your room.

492
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Get some rest.

493
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Is it just my imagination?

494
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I think I heard someone.

495
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Okay.

496
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'll go back to my room.

497
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
"I'm sorry."

498
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Did you hear that?

499
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes, I heard it too.

500
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I think it's coming from that direction.

501
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Let's go.

502
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You should learn from your mistakes.

504
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You think that's all you can do?

505
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No.

506
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Who is that?

508
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Why is Tole so scared?

509
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It must be a ball monster.

510
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Tole, don't cry.

511
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Tole, you should focus.

513
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You should focus on that person.

514
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And use your over-medicine.

515
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Come on.

516
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm so tired.

517
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I don't want to attack my own mother.

518
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That's not your mother.

519
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That's a ball monster.

520
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yes, you're right.

521
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You should focus.

522
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And use your over-medicine.

523
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Come on.

524
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Concentrate.

525
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You can do it.

526
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And imagine that your mother is funny.

527
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You can do it.

528
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Come on.

529
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Concentrate.

530
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Over-medicine.

532
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
My mother is so beautiful.

533
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And funny.

534
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:54,000
My mother is funny.

535
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Why did you disappear?

536
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Where did you go?

537
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You guys...

538
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You disappeared.

539
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yes.

540
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
What are you doing here?

541
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I...

542
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm here to pick you up.

543
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I want to join you.

544
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You're scared of me, right?

545
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You were sleeping last night.

546
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yes.

547
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You were sleeping last night.

548
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You were snoring.

549
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Why?

550
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You woke me up.

551
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So, what are we going to do now?

552
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We're going to Mr. Panji's house.

553
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He can fix our telescope.

554
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The broken one.

555
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yes, you're right.

556
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Let's go.

557
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm bored in my room.

558
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
What should I do?

559
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, right.

560
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He helped me.

561
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I should pay him.

562
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But...

563
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What should I do?

564
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well...

565
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm here.

566
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Throw it.

Javatan, attack the labo.

569
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes, I did it.

570
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000

I'm so tired.

Javatan, throw the trash.

575
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Yes.

576
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's clean.

577
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It looks neat.

578
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It means, the labo is clean.

579
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Help!

580
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Let us go.

581
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Please, let us go.

582
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That voice again.

583
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I think I know that voice.

584
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But, why I don't know?

585
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It looks like they're building another school.

586
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Stop them.

587
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Help!

588
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Let us go.

589
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Please, let us go.

590
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That voice again.

591
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I think I know that voice.

592
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But, why I don't know?

593
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:53,000
[The next episode]

594
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
If I open this door,

595
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
he'll be mad.

596
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:16,000
[The next episode]

597
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Please, don't.

598
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Don't kill me.

599
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Go.

600
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Go away.

601
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That voice again.

602
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I think he's asking for help.

603
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I have to help him.

604
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'll pay him.

605
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I have to help him.

606
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Good morning, kids.

607
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Good morning, sir.

608
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Today, me and the teachers...

609
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
will build a school...

610
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
that was destroyed by the explosion.

611
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And this school's improvement...

612
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
will take time and energy...

613
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
from the teachers.

614
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
For the next 12 hours,

615
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
we will concentrate...

616
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
on the school's improvement.

617
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And as long as the process goes on,

618
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
it can't be stopped.

619
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
We ask you...

620
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
to be vigilant.

621
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Always be careful in school.

622
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Watch everything.

623
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Don't let anyone...

624
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
get into the school's page.

625
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Do you understand?

626
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We understand, sir.

627
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And while we prepare the energy,

628
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Professor Titan will teach you...

629
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
the Totok Mantra...

630
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
to fight the bad guys.

631
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You have to focus and concentrate.

632
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We have to fight together...

633
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
for our school.

634
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yes, sir.

635
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
What poem do we want to learn, sir?

636
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Hey!

637
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Smile!

638
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We will learn magic...

639
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
without using...

640
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
a magic wand.

641
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Magic wand?

642
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
How can we use a magic wand?

643
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Right? / Yes, sir.

644
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
How, sir?

645
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You just found out, right?

646
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Now, keep your magic wands.

647
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
All creatures have weak spots.

648
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
They are in the neck,

649
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
waist,

650
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and toes.

651
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Do you understand?

652
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Hey! Give me a smile.

653
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Come here, Jack.

654
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Try attacking me.

655
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Are you sure, sir?

656
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm not hurt. / Just attack me.

657
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Yes, Jack.

658
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yes, sir.

659
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Sir!

660
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Sir, help me!

661
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Sir!

662
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Please, open my eyes.

663
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
To open the eyes,

664
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
you have to press...

665
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
one of the cheekbones.

666
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Do you understand?

667
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes, sir.

668
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Now, you have to try...

669
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and find your partner.

670
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Do you understand?

671
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes, sir.

672
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Now, try to find your partner.

673
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Are you ready?

674
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
One, two, three.

675
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Sir!

676
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Help me!

677
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You found him!

678
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Sir!

679
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Sir! / Try to press it.

680
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Why can't I do it?

681
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Try to step back.

682
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Let the professor teach you.

683
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Like this, Tommy.

684
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The other one, please.

685
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
You, please.

686
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Are you ready?

687
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Let's build our school.

688
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yes, sir.

689
00:48:46,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It looks like they're building another school, sir.

690
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Stop them, Anggar.

691
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Doctor!

692
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Try to open your eyes.

693
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Hurry!

694
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Let's finish the other one.

695
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
What?

696
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Let's finish the other one.

697
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Where are you going?

698
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This forest is dangerous.

699
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You better not play here.

700
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We're going to this forest...

701
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
to find a resident here.

702
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
His name is Mr. Panji. Do you know him?

703
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yes, I do.

704
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't want to be a part of this.

705
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I want to live. Excuse me.

706
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
What does he mean?

707
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Why is he going?

708
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't know. He's running away.

709
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Let's go, sir.

710
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm scared.

711
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Where am I going?

712
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I have to help him.

713
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
What's that?

714
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm going to lock you up.

715
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Lock her up.

716
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:04,000
To be continued...

717
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
We can do it!

718
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
To be continued...

719
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
We can do it!

720
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Help!

721
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Professor!

722
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Can I help you for a moment?

723
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Yes, Gantara.

724
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The process of repairing the school has been completed.

725
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
If we stop it now, everything will be in vain.

726
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:07,000
To be continued...

727
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I told you not to come near this cave.

728
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Not to mention opening the door and entering.

729
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But what happened?

730
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You've violated my advice.

731
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And you've violated your own promise.

732
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
No.

733
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I heard a voice asking for help.

734
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Actually...

735
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
What is it?

736
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
That's none of your business.

737
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
If there's someone who's hiding there,

738
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
that's my business.

739
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That's my business so that people can be safe.

740
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Actually, who are you to hide people like that?

741
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You're probably...

742
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
a traitor!

743
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
If I'm a traitor, why would I save you?

744
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:27,000
If you're a traitor, why would I save you?

745
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Whatever! I should go home now.

746
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I should go home now.

747
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
The house is haunted.

748
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
The monsters are everywhere.

749
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:33,000
What's that?

750
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Excuse me.

751
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:58,000
What's wrong with her?

752
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Is this really Mr. Panji's house?

753
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes.

754
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I need your help.

755
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Can you fix this telescope?

756
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I can.

757
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But I don't want to fix it.

758
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Now, all of you leave.

759
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Hurry up!

760
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Ghost!

761
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Stop!

762
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Help me!

763
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We have to help him!

764
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But how?

765
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't know.

766
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:54,000
You're stupid.

767
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have helped him.

768
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
But luckily, he didn't get in this room.

769
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I have to change the key.

770
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
A painting patent.

771
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:26,000
From now on, if you want to open this door, you have to say the word.

772
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Alfa.

773
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
That's the...

774
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Alfa.

775
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:21,000
This is your food for the day.

776
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm hungry.

777
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I've chanted the door...

778
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
...with your names.

779
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I've chanted the door...

780
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
...with your names.

781
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I've chanted the door...

782
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
...with your names.

783
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I've chanted the door...

784
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
...with your names.

785
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I've chanted the door...

786
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
...with your names.

787
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I've chanted the door...

788
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
...with your names.

789
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I've chanted the door...

790
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
...with your names.

791
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I've chanted the door...

792
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
...with your names.

793
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Please don't kill us.

794
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Help!

795
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:40,000
We can do it!

796
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Stop!

797
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Guys, we have to help Jack.

798
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
We can't leave him.

799
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But how? The monster is too high.

800
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
You can fly.

801
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Use the poppy.

802
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Okay.

803
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Get ready.

804
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Fly!

805
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Boss!

806
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Help!

807
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Help us!

808
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Get ready to attack.

809
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Attack!

810
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Help!

811
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Attack!

812
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Tommy, help Jack!

813
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Jack!

814
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Jack, go!

815
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Jack!

816
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Jack, come on!

817
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
No!

818
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yes!

819
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Thank you, Boss!

820
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's too high.

821
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Wait!

822
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Hurry up!

823
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Attack!

824
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
We have to get out of here.

825
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Be careful, Nick!

826
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Watch out, Nick!

827
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Help!

828
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Tommy!

829
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Professor!

830
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Can I help Nick for a moment?

831
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Don't be reckless.

832
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
We're already focused.

833
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
The school is already happening.

834
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But Nick looks injured, Professor.

835
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Don't be reckless.

836
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Nick is a strong kid.

837
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
He can handle this.

838
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We have to trust the kids.

839
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
We have to be sure.

840
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
They can do it.

841
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:11,000
What's your next plan, Sir?

842
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I want to fight back.

843
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
There are people who have destroyed me.

844
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And the first one...

845
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
...is you.

846
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
What should I do, Sir?

847
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
We will do...

848
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
...the attack of the missile.

849
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Get ready.

850
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
[laughing]

851
01:04:38,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Sir!

852
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
What's wrong with him?

853
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
He's under attack.

854
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Attack?

855
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
What attack?

856
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Judging from his attack,

857
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I think he's under attack by a monster.

858
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Let's go.

859
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Monster?

860
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Don't tell me...

861
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Help!

862
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Is he under attack by a monster?

863
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yes, he is.

864
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Don't go to the house in the middle of the forest.

865
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
The owner is a monster.

866
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Be careful.

867
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Help!

868
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
The house in the middle of the forest?

869
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
No.

870
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's his house.

871
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
[music]

872
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Guys,

873
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
while Reptor is chasing Tommy, Jack, and Mike,

874
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
let's attack them from the side.

875
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
There are so many people.

876
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That's why we don't have to fight.

877
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
What's wrong with you, Sir?

878
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
This is for fishing.

879
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Don't eat it.

880
01:06:27,000 --> 01:07:38,260
