14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I was accepted to a magic school

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Three days until the full moon

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And if in the full moon, the dark lord gets the stone of eternity

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He will get unlimited power and will destroy the whole world

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will prove that I'm right

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just wait and see

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I won't let anyone disturb my mission

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:56,000
To take the stone of eternity

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And from now on, the school has decided

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If Alfa is not expelled from the school

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Good bye

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's eat together

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's eat

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You eat, don't be a spoiled kid

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why are you shaking?

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm afraid of getting a cold

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you're cold, just do it

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm afraid my food will be eaten by the drought

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, just do it

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Really?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, it will be cold there, hurry up

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hey, you're still down there

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm going to die

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to die, I'm going to die

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to die

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want to meet the guards

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Albert!

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let me go!

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Albert!

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You will regret it because you have caught me

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And don't you think that the dark prince won't wake up

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Because you have caught me

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The terror won't end here

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And in the end, you will lose

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This school will be destroyed!

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let me go!

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Watch him

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me go!

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't let the students hear his scream

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes, professor

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let me go!

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Albert!

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let me go!

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Students, now I will teach you how to use the enemy's weapon

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Pay attention, okay?

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Weapon's ready!

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Now it's time for you to practice

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Try Ray and...

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Where is Tole?

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I haven't seen Tole since yesterday

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know where Tole is

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What should we do?

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Professor Adni, I'm sorry, I'll cut the line

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Students, I've told you a thousand times

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Gorilla, dream of a giraffe

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you want to be a child, don't be a coward

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Throw the leftovers in the trash

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who is this?

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Huh?

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a cockroach

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Who is it?

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey, don't be a coward!

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, don't tell me that's Metal

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes, he's a chicken now

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's afraid of me

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Megantara, where did you get the chicken?

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Near the lake

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He ate it and then he ate my food

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Albert, that's a big cockroach

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Here, Garip

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a gift for your birthday

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why is it only for flowers?

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Here, Garip

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For you

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
For me?

90
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Be careful, Nick!

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You too, Garip

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Nick, Nick!

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you shaking?

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm not shaking

95
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Nick, Nick!

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why are you shaking?

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know either

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Garip!

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Professor!

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Garip!

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Garip, the tank has been kidnapped

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How did it go?

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So we ran away to the lake and

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There are some dogs following us

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And then Karin just disappeared

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, how?

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's so scary

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Calm down, kids

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Megantara

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's better if you take the kids back to school

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And tell the others

112
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't leave the school until it's safe

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, professor

114
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's go to the lake, follow me

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to go back to the lake

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who knows if I save Tole

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can be a hero like Alfa

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hey, there's a robber

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Come back to my friends

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
One by one, don't be late

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You guys

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Come on, come on, guys

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Come on, come on

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Help me

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And this is our savior this time

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Rey

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Who saved Tole and Karin from the attack

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:44,000
[Applause]

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ouch

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Rey

131
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hold it

132
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Where's Rey?

133
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Rey

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Where is she?

135
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's Rey

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why is she there?

137
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why isn't she far away?

138
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Wait, wait

139
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think there's something wrong

140
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's actually Rey, not like this

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Come on, let's follow her

142
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Maybe she has an idea that's not finished

143
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Come on

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't be afraid

145
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because I'm going to be a hero

146
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But

147
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know what the enemy is like

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What if the dog is fierce?

149
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What if I get bitten?

150
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
[Scream]

151
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Tommy

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are you doing here?

153
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're going to the lake

154
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We're going to beat the dog that stole your friend

155
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Tole

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's a good friend

157
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Good

158
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sorry

159
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We're not good

160
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We just want to be heroes

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a waste of your friend's fate

162
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Tole

163
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't be like me

164
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I also want to be a hero

165
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What if we go there together?

166
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Come on

167
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Where is it?

168
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Where?

169
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't be like that

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He's in the lake

171
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We have to find him

172
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Come on

173
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay, let's go

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Where are you going?

175
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
All students are ordered to stay silent in their respective dormitories

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The question is where are you going?

177
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Come back

178
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Or I will give you punishment

179
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What are you doing in the middle of the hill?

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
B U B U K A K B U K

181
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why do you have so many questions?

182
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
K K Karin

183
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm in the lake

184
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
My proof

185
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Karin

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Karin, wake up

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey

188
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wake up

189
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Where am I?

190
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't know either

191
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We must be rescued here by the eagle

192
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Mom, Dad

193
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm a kid

194
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Help

195
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Eh, where are you?

196
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Sorry, Tom, I'm scared

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Tom, it's really scary

198
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Where are you? Who are you looking for?

199
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We're all alone

200
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You all scared me

201
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If the eagle doesn't show up

202
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We'll fish for it to show up

203
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Then we catch it

204
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
How, Tom? The eagle is here

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes, Tom

206
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Someone must swim

207
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Please, Tom

208
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't swim

209
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You know I can't swim

210
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't tempt me

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
[Cough]

212
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't feel good, Tom

213
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
[Cough]

214
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, Tom

215
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You all are so annoying

216
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's it

217
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're all stupid

218
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If you want to lose, you have to swim to the middle

219
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yes

220
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The eagle is here

221
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hurry up, stupid

222
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
[Cough]

223
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll follow you

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If I get caught

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can't be angry

226
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You want to be expelled from this school?

227
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Huh?

228
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, Tom

229
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Om Pimpa Layum Gambreng

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
[Cheering]

231
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It means one of you has to swim

232
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Come on, swim again

233
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Om Pimpa Layum Gambreng

234
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes

235
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Two more

236
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It means you and Ray have to swim

237
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Whoever loses has to swim to the middle

238
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes, Kong

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It should be him

240
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Jack can't swim

241
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He's already drenched before he gets to the middle

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't waste time

243
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hurry up, stupid

244
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes

245
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
[Cow mooing]

246
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You have to swim to the middle

247
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Now I have to swim to the middle

248
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You want to be an expert, right?

249
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
[Cow mooing]

250
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The horse is coming

251
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Come on, Ray

252
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Come on

253
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You can't be fast

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You lose

255
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hurry up, Ray

256
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You're going to lose again

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Come on, hurry up

258
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't be far

259
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
To the middle, Ray

260
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm already in the middle

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're going to be in the middle

262
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You said you wanted to be an expert

263
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Come on, what are you going to do?

264
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Come on, guys

265
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Come on

266
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Help

267
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Help me first

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Help

269
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You think

270
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's easy to beat the ducklings

271
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You think you're all great

272
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The result is very bad

273
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
For some students

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Must be treated in a treatment clinic

275
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If there is a serious problem

276
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This school can be closed

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What do you want?

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No, Prof

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Now

280
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You all go back to the dormitory

281
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And no one can leave school

282
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Without any reason

283
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And without exception

284
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Understand?

285
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Understand, Prof

286
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You all I order to clean the school toilet

287
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Without magic

288
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you doing?

289
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Have you changed there?

290
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Now I want to talk to Professor Alubaran

291
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm with the professor

292
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sure

293
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The ducklings are only in war

294
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It seems there is a greater power

295
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That controls them

296
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I agree

297
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The ducklings are good

298
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Good

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They kidnap students

300
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And hurt students

301
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
True, Professor

302
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Nine people were injured

303
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And three were missing

304
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And if the parents of the students know

305
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This school can be closed

306
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In my opinion

307
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
We must take action

308
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
To the ducklings

309
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I disagree

310
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The ducklings are good

311
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If we don't take action

312
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
To the ducklings

313
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
More victims will fall

314
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We must take action

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Now

316
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Agree

317
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Get the doll

318
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Get the broom

319
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Bro

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
We attack

321
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes

322
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Attack

323
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Stop the attack

324
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
They can hurt the children

325
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The ducklings should be able to defeat us

326
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But we can't do anything

327
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They attack Karin, Tole and Rey

328
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Really

329
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Bro

330
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Rey was kidnapped by the ducklings

331
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We have to help her

332
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Basics

333
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Head-strong teachers

334
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I told you

335
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They don't want to hear

336
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The ducklings are good

337
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There must be a reason

338
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Soldier

339
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Why must be surprised

340
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What is it

341
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Sorry soldier

342
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Do you know if Rey was kidnapped by the ducklings

343
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes

344
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I know

345
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We want to free Rey

346
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Do you know what the ducklings' weakness is

347
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't know

348
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But the ducklings may know

349
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Come on

350
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Hey

351
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What

352
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Where are you going

353
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We want to find the ducklings

354
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yes

355
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Come on

356
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Ouch

357
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Alpha

358
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I will call the ducklings

359
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And you hide

360
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Because the ducklings don't like men

361
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Watch out Alpha

362
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What's up Vega

363
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Is there anything we can help

364
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Here's the girl from the army

365
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The ducklings attacked us

366
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And my friends were attacked by the ducklings

367
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I want to help the ducklings

368
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Weird

369
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
As far as I know, the ducklings are good

370
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Really

371
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But why did they attack my friends

372
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't know

373
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But as far as I know, the ducklings don't like to attack people

374
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
They prefer to mate

375
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And if they mate, it can last for hours

376
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Is that right, girls

377
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's right

378
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We got the weakness, Vega

379
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The ducklings like to watch

380
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So we have to make them reflect

381
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
There's another one

382
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Run

383
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Ouch Alpha

384
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
The ducklings are out

385
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
She's going to attack another one

386
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The ducklings are so fierce

387
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Vega, don't be sad anymore

388
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We're almost there

389
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Come on, Vega

390
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We got the weakness

391
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Finger snap

392
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You guys are so stubborn

393
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
If you want to be free

394
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Answer my question first

395
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You're our friends

396
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Why do you have to be alone with them

397
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's so late, Vega

398
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We'll ask him again tomorrow

399
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
What's that sound

400
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Let's go up there

401
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
A duck

402
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes

403
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's go

404
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Are you ready?

405
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes

406
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
This is perfect, Mike

407
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If we bring this duck to our tent

408
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We can be hunters

409
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yes, bro

410
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We can be famous than Tommy

411
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That's right

412
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Let's go

413
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's so heavy

414
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Mike, come here

415
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Just shut up

416
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's heavy

417
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Where is he, Jack?

418
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Hurry up

419
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Hey

420
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Why are you two being chased by the devil

421
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No, boss

422
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We're just chasing the duck

423
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Are you two crazy?

424
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The duck is in the back of the school

425
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Are you serious?

426
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yes, boss

427
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's why it's so dangerous

428
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We have to get out of this school

429
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll call my dad first

430
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Where are they going?

431
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
There must be something

432
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Mega

433
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
He's bleeding, Mega

434
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We have to help him

435
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Why did he run away?

436
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I don't know

437
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Maybe he's afraid of us

438
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Okay, Mega

439
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Give him a mirror

440
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
To calm him down

441
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Here

442
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Mirror

443
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Here's the medicine

444
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Here, Mega

445
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's not fair

446
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
They're friends with the duck

447
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Maybe

448
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They're the ones who planned the terror in the school

449
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I have to report this

450
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
He's smiling

451
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That means he's not angry anymore

452
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes

453
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Maybe he's aware

454
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
If we treat his face

455
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Maybe he wants to kiss you

456
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
[Laugh]

457
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Um

458
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Duck

459
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Now we're friends, right?

460
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
[Squeak]

461
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Answer me

462
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Where are my friends now?

463
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh

464
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The lake

465
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
[Squeak]

466
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
What's this for?

467
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
To eat

468
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
What's this, Mega?

469
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I read in a book

470
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
If the mirror is far from the duck

471
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It can make the person who eats it

472
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Breathe in the water

473
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Wow

474
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's cool

475
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Mega

476
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It feels weird

477
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes

478
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But

479
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We can breathe in the water now

480
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Right?

481
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Show your spirit

482
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Get ready to find friends

483
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Running, jumping, jumping

484
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Star

485
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Brave

486
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Unknown words

487
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Surrender

488
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Chase

489
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Hope and dreams

490
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Go, go, go

491
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Until everyone

492
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You're in jail

493
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They're in the water

494
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Don't

495
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You guys

496
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Attack my friends because you're forced

497
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So

498
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Where are our friends?

499
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You don't want to tell me

500
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Hey

501
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Where are you taking us?

502
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Don't do it

503
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Don't

504
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You guys are forced

505
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Don't do it

506
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You're in jail

507
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Briga

508
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Briga, wake up, Briga

509
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Briga

510
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Buy soap using a table

511
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Just play with your eyes

512
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Because of you

513
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Bro

514
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's better now we take Vega to the clinic

515
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Hurry up, Megantara

516
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Come on

517
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Huh

518
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Doctor

519
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Where's the doctor?

520
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Doctor

521
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Why are you here?

522
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I need a doctor

523
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Why are you here?

524
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Doctor ran away

525
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Why did you run away?

526
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Doctor ran away

527
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Professor Adebaran asked him to go to the village across

528
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
To treat people

529
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So I'm the one who's in charge

530
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay, okay, that's enough

531
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Now, please, please, Vega

532
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He's been possessed by Professor Purwa

533
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, that's a bad kid, Purwa

534
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Wow, that's a bad omen, it can't be

535
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I mean Professor Purwa

536
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yes, wait

537
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Mom

538
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Do you need to call 10 girls?

539
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Like when you cure Ray

540
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Uh, I don't think so

541
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This seems to be worse

542
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Uh, worse

543
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So what?

544
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
He must use the water of the butterfly

545
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Now the butterfly has run away

546
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
What should we do?

547
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Vega

548
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You wait

549
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I will definitely find the water of the butterfly for you

550
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Quiet

551
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The point is, me and my husband

552
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Don't want to hear any excuses

553
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And now I will bring my beloved son Tommy

554
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
To the village

555
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Because in my opinion, it's not safe here

556
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Right, daddy?

557
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Right, honey?

558
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Uncle

559
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Mike and I want to go with you

560
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Come on, uncle

561
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
We ride, uncle

562
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh, sure

563
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Uncle has prepared the ship, we go home

564
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Daddy, you can't invite your father

565
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I will not stop my father and mother

566
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
If you want to bring your son and mother home from this school

567
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And I, after I become the head of the school

568
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Apologize

569
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
For all the inconveniences that my parents have experienced

570
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I will try to solve this problem as soon as possible

571
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Think you

572
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Think

573
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Vega

574
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Sorry, professor, I didn't mean to

575
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's okay, Alfa

576
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
How's Vega?

577
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That's right, professor

578
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I want to tell you, professor

579
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The only way to save Vega

580
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Use the Eremata Duyung

581
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Eremata Duyung

582
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Okay, Alfa

583
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Let's go now

584
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Look for Eremata Duyung

585
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So Vega can be saved quickly

586
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Alfa, let me call the Duyung

587
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Don't, professor

588
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Later the Duyung is afraid

589
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Let me call

590
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Putri Duyung, where are you?

591
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Putri Duyung, I need your help

592
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Putri Duyung

593
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Until now, Vega is still unconscious

594
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Because of the magic of the ancient professor

595
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
He said the offer is your Eremata

596
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Can I ask for your Eremata for Vega?

597
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Daffa, hold on tight

598
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Alfa, put it here

599
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Thank you Putri Duyung

600
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You're so kind

601
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Duyung

602
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Who did that?

603
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I did it

604
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
What do you want?

605
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's none of your business

606
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You better go now

607
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Bring the Eremata and save your friend

608
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Hurry

609
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Alfa, you better bring the Eremata now

610
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Poor Vega

611
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I will make sure Putri Duyung will be fine

612
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Hurry up

613
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm sorry Putri Duyung

614
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I have to go

615
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But I will help you

616
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Daffa, hold on tight

617
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Vega, you're cured

618
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
You're cured

619
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I was bewitched by Professor Purwa

620
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
What about Duyung?

621
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
He ran away

622
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Thank God

623
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But he came back

624
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Why?

625
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Because the only way to make you realize

626
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That's Eremata Duyung

627
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
He came back just to help me?

628
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yes, because he's back

629
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
He was caught by Professor Purwa

630
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We have to help him

631
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I don't want him to get hurt

632
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Let's go

633
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I have caught Duyung

634
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And now we can interrogate him

635
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
To find out where the students are being held

636
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Let me show you

637
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's so delicious

638
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Let's go home

639
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Luckily, you came here quickly

640
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Or else we could have kidnapped Duyung

641
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Right?

642
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Of course, who's first?

643
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Tommy

644
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Alfa and Vega will be kidnapped by Duyung

645
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's right

646
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
What's going on?

647
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Tommy, help me

648
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Tommy

649
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Tommy, help me

650
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Help me

651
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
[Screaming]

652
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Tommy, help me

653
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Tommy

654
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Tommy, help me

655
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Tommy

656
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Tommy, help me

657
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Tommy

658
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
What's going on?

659
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
What's that?

660
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Tommy

661
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Why is he here?

662
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't know

663
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
[Screaming]

664
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Open the door

665
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
[Screaming]

666
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Open the door

667
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
[Screaming]

668
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Open the door

669
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
[Screaming]

670
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
He's been kidnapped

671
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Open the door, it's so heavy

672
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
[Screaming]

673
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Give me back my brother!

674
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Brother!

675
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Help!

676
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Brother!

677
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Two more children.

678
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Then your task will be done.

679
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And I will give you back your voice.

680
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Remember.

681
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
One of those children...

682
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
must be named Alfa.

683
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Alfa.

684
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I know that voice.

685
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yes, I feel like I know him too.

686
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
But who?

687
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yes, it's so weird.

688
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Why does that person know Alfa?

689
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Who is he?

690
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Alfa.

691
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You're wrong if you think I'm going to lose.

692
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I will never lose, Alfaro.

693
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I will never lose.

694
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Alfaro's voice.

695
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Where is he?

696
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Alfaro's voice.

697
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Alfaro.

698
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
The terror will continue.

699
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Until I get that chosen child.

700
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Take him to the lake.

701
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Everyone will attack the castle first.

702
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:55,000
We can do it.

703
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Now tell me where the students are hiding.

704
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Answer me.

705
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Don't be ridiculous.

706
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I will kill you.

707
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Calm down.

708
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Come in.

709
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Get out, professor.

710
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Get out.

711
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Come on.

712
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Tommy.

713
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Tommy, wake up.

714
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Help me.

715
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Tommy, wake up.

716
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm going to kill you.

717
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
What happened?

718
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
We were walking.

719
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
There was a big wave.

720
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Then the students appeared.

721
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
They pulled Tommy and his friends to the sea.

722
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Tommy.

723
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That's why we're here.

724
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
To ask for your help.

725
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
We have to find the students and destroy the castle.

726
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I agree.

727
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
We attack the students.

728
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
They are too much.

729
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I disagree.

730
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Is Duyung really a good person?

731
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Megatara is right.

732
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
He wants to give his power to Vega.

733
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
If Duyung is a good person, why did they kidnap the students?

734
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I agree.

735
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I will help them.

736
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
There must be something that forces them to do that.

737
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Megatara.

738
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
If you're afraid, you can stay here.

739
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But don't be too hasty.

740
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Everyone, get ready.

741
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We go to the castle first.

742
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Your friends have kidnapped the students.

743
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
We will attack your castle to free the students.

744
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Megatara, do you see where they are?

745
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They are going to attack the castle.

746
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Alfa, let's go to the lake.

747
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay.

748
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Alfa.

749
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Megatara.

750
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Why are our students in danger?

751
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Wait.

752
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You're wrong.

753
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Duyung is a good person.

754
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
They are bad people.

755
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Professor Purwoh.

756
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Did you hear what Alfa said?

757
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yes.

758
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I think we should stop this attack.

759
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Instead of doing stupid things and endangering people.

760
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
No.

761
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I have to find my daughter, Tobi.

762
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And I have to take revenge on Duyung.

763
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Because he has ruined my life.

764
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Alfa must have been brainwashed by Duyung.

765
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What should we do?

766
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
We're late.

767
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Let's just follow them.

768
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Okay.

769
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Alfa.

770
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Vega.

771
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
What are you doing?

772
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You can swim.

773
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You can attack.

774
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Palm trees.

775
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Turquoise trees.

776
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
You can't attack.

777
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You can only attack.

778
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We have no other choice.

779
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
We don't want to hurt Duyung.

780
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We will use this method.

781
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
This is the method.

782
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Daffatang.

783
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Bufa Bajo.

784
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Bufa Renang.

785
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Wow.

786
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That's cool.

787
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
By using this method.

788
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
We can breathe.

789
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And talk inside.

790
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay.

791
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Ready.

792
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
One.

793
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Two.

794
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Three.

795
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:07,000
That's where Duyung's palace is.

796
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Let's call them.

797
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Hey, Duyung.

798
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Come out.

799
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We have captured one of your friends.

800
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
If you don't come out and surrender.

801
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
We will punish your friend.

802
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Why aren't they coming out?

803
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Be patient.

804
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
We will wait a little longer.

805
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
They will come out to kill him.

806
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Be patient.

807
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You are a swine.

808
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Alfa, it's dangerous.

809
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We have no other choice.

810
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
No, Mama.

811
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I'm scared.

812
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
We are all scared.

813
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And hungry.

814
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Karim.

815
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Bufa.

816
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Shut up.

817
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Remember.

818
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
If you dare to do anything.

819
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I will make you become a swine.
