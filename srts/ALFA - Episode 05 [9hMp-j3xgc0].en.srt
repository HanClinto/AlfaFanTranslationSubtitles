Go, go, go, we can do it

I was accepted to a magic school

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Three days until the full moon

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And if in the full moon, the dark lord gets the stone of eternity

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He will get unlimited power and will destroy the whole world

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will prove that I'm right

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just wait and see

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I won't let anyone disturb my mission

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:56,000
To take the stone of eternity

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And from now on, the school has decided

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If Alva is not expelled from the school

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Good bye

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000

You will regret it because you have caught me

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And don't you think that the dark prince won't wake up

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Because you have caught me

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The terror won't end here

46

Yes, he's a chicken now

He's afraid of me

Megantara, where did you get the chicken?

Near the lake

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He ate it and then he ate my food

Albert, that's a big cockroach

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Or else we could have kidnapped Duyung

785
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Right?

786
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Of course, who's first?

787
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Tommy

788
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Alva and Vega will be kidnapped by Duyung

789
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's right

790
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
What's going on?

791
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Tommy, help me

792
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Tommy

793
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Tommy, help me

794
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000

Tommy

Tommy, help me

What's that?

809
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Tommy

810
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Why is he here?

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000

Brother!

Help!

825
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Brother!

826
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Two more children.

827
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Then your task will be done.

828
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And I will give you back your voice.

829
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Remember.

830
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
One of those children...

831
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
must be named Alva.

832
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Alva.

833
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I know that voice.

834
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yes, I feel like I know him too.

835
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
But who?

836
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yes, it's so weird.

837
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Why does that person know Alva?

838
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Who is he?

839
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Alva.

840
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You're wrong if you think I'm going to lose.

841
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I will never lose, Alvaro.

842
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I will never lose.

843
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Alvaro's voice.

844
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Where is he?

845
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Alvaro's voice.

846
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Alvaro.

847
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
The terror will continue.

848
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Until I get that chosen child.

849
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Take him to the lake.

850
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Everyone will attack the castle first.

851
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:55,000
We can do it.

852
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Now tell me where the students are hiding.

853
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Answer me.

854
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Don't be ridiculous.

855
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I will kill you.

856
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Calm down.

857
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Come in.

858
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Get out, professor.

859
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Get out.

860
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Come on.

861
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Tommy.

862
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Tommy, wake up.

863
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Help me.

864
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Tommy, wake up.

865
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm going to kill you.

866
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
What happened?

867
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
We were walking.

868
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
There was a big wave.

869
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Then the students appeared.

870
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
They pulled Tommy and his friends to the sea.

871
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Tommy.

872
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That's why we're here.

873
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
To ask for your help.

874
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
We have to find the students and destroy the castle.

875
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I agree.

876
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
We attack the students.

877
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
They are too much.

878
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I disagree.

879
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Is Duyung really a good person?

880
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Megatara is right.

881
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
He wants to give his power to Vega.

882
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
If Duyung is a good person, why did they kidnap the students?

883
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I agree.

884
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I will help them.

885
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
There must be something that forces them to do that.

886
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Megatara.

887
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
If you're afraid, you can stay here.

888
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But don't be too hasty.

889
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Everyone, get ready.

890
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We go to the castle first.

891
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Your friends have kidnapped the students.

892
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
We will attack your castle to free the students.

893
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Megatara, do you see where they are?

894
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They are going to attack the castle.

895
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Alva, let's go to the lake.

896
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay.

897
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Alva.

898
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Megatara.

899
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Why are our students in danger?

900
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Wait.

901
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You're wrong.

902
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Duyung is a good person.

903
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
They are bad people.

904
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Professor Purwoh.

905
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Did you hear what Alva said?

906
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yes.

907
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I think we should stop this attack.

908
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Instead of doing stupid things and endangering people.

909
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
No.

910
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I have to find my daughter, Tobi.

911
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And I have to take revenge on Duyung.

912
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Because he has ruined my life.

913
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Alva must have been brainwashed by Duyung.

914
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
What should we do?

915
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
We're late.

916
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Let's just follow them.

917
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Okay.

918
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Alva.

919
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Vega.

920
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
What are you doing?

921
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You can swim.

922
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You can attack.

923
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Palm trees.

924
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Turquoise trees.

925
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
You can't attack.

926
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You can only attack.

927
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We have no other choice.

928
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
We don't want to hurt Duyung.

929
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We will use this method.

930
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
This is the method.

931
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Daffatang.

932
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Bufa Bajo.

933
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Bufa Renang.

934
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Wow.

935
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That's cool.

936
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
By using this method.

937
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
We can breathe.

938
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And talk inside.

939
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay.

940
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Ready.

941
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
One.

942
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Two.

943
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Three.

944
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:07,000
That's where Duyung's palace is.

945
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Let's call them.

946
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Hey, Duyung.

947
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Come out.

948
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We have captured one of your friends.

949
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
If you don't come out and surrender.

950
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
We will punish your friend.

951
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Why aren't they coming out?

952
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Be patient.

953
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
We will wait a little longer.

954
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
They will come out to kill him.

955
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Be patient.

956
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You are a swine.

957
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Alva, it's dangerous.

958
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We have no other choice.

959
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
No, Mama.

960
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I'm scared.

961
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
We are all scared.

962
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And hungry.

963
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Karim.

964
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Bufa.

965
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Shut up.

966
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Remember.

967
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
If you dare to do anything.

968
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I will make you become a swine.

969
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
