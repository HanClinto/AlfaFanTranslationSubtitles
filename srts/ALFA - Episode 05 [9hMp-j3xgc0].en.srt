 Show your spirit, get your friends ready

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Be brave, don't give up

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000

 Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I was accepted to a magic school

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Three days until the full moon

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And if in the full moon, the dark lord gets the stone of eternity

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 He will get unlimited power and will destroy the whole world

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I will prove that I'm right

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Just wait and see

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I won't let anyone disturb my mission

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 To take the stone of eternity

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 To take the stone of eternity

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 To take the stone of eternity

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 To take the stone of eternity

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And from now on, the school has decided

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 If Alva is not expelled from the school

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Good bye

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Let's eat together

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Let's eat

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Okay

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 You eat, don't be a spoiled kid

34

 Why are you shaking?

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I'm afraid of getting a cold

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 If you're cold, just do it

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'm afraid my food will be eaten by the drought

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 No, just do it

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Really?

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Yes, it will be cold there, hurry up

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Hey, you're still down there

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I'm going to die

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I'm going to die, I'm going to die

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I want to meet the guards

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Let me go!

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Albert!

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You will regret it because you have caught me

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And don't you think that the dark prince won't wake up

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Because you have caught me

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 The terror won't end here

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And in the end, you will lose

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 This school will be destroyed!

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Let me go!

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Watch him

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Let me go!

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Don't let the students hear his scream

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Yes, professor

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000

 Let me go!

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Students, now I will teach you how to use the enemy's weapon

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Pay attention, okay?

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Weapon's ready!

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Now it's time for you to practice

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Try Ray and...

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Where is Tole?

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I haven't seen Tole since yesterday

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I don't know where Tole is

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 What should we do?

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Professor Adni, I'm sorry, I'll cut the line

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Students, I've told you a thousand times

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Gorilla, dream of a giraffe

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 If you want to be a child, don't be a coward

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Throw the leftovers in the trash

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Who is this?

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Huh?

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 It's a cockroach

 Hey, don't be a coward!

 Hey, don't tell me that's Metal

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Yes, he's a chicken now

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 He's afraid of me

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Megantara, where did you get the chicken?

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Near the lake

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 He ate it and then he ate my food

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Albert, that's a big cockroach

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Here, Garip

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 This is a gift for your birthday

 Until now, Vega is still unconscious

797
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Because of the magic of the ancient professor

798
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 He said the offer is your Eremata

799
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Can I ask for your Eremata for Vega?

 You're cured

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 I was bewitched by Professor Purwa

 What about Duyung?

 Why?

 Megatara is right.

959
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 He wants to give his power to Vega.

960
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 If Duyung is a good person, why did they kidnap the students?

961
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 I agree.

962
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 I will help them.

963
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 There must be something that forces them to do that.

964
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 Megatara.

965
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 If you're afraid, you can stay here.

966
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 But don't be too hasty.

967
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 Everyone, get ready.

968
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000

 Wait.

 You're wrong.

 Professor Purwoh.

983
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 Did you hear what Alva said?

984
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 Yes.

985
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 I think we should stop this attack.

986
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 Instead of doing stupid things and endangering people.

987
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 No.

988
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
 I have to find my daughter, Tobi.

989
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 And I have to take revenge on Duyung.

990
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 Because he has ruined my life.

991
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 Alva must have been brainwashed by Duyung.

992
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 What should we do?

993
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 We're late.

994
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 Let's just follow them.

995
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 Okay.

996
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 Alva.

997
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 Vega.

998
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 What are you doing?

999
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 You can swim.

1000
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 You can attack.

1001
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 Palm trees.

1002
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 Turquoise trees.

1003
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 You can't attack.

1004
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 You can only attack.

1005
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 We have no other choice.

1006
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 We don't want to hurt Duyung.

1007
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 We will use this method.

1008
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 This is the method.

1009
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 Daffatang.

1010
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 Bufa Bajo.

1011
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 Bufa Renang.

1012
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 Wow.

1013
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 That's cool.

1014
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 By using this method.

1015
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 We can breathe.

1016
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 And talk inside.

1017
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 Okay.

1018
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 Ready.

1019
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 One.

1020
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 Two.

1021
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 Three.

1022
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 That's where Duyung's palace is.

1023
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Let's call them.

1024
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
 Hey, Duyung.

1025
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 Come out.

1026
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 We have captured one of your friends.

1027
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 If you don't come out and surrender.

1028
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 We will punish your friend.

1029
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 Why aren't they coming out?

1030
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 Be patient.

1031
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 We will wait a little longer.

1032
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 They will come out to kill him.

1033
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 Be patient.

1034
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 You are a swine.

1035
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 You are a swine.

1036
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 Alva, it's dangerous.

1037
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 We have no other choice.

1038
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 No, Mama.

1039
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 I'm scared.

1040
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 We are all scared.

1041
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 And hungry.

1042
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 Karim.

1043
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
 Bufa.

1044
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,000
 Shut up.

1045
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 Remember.

1046
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 If you dare to do anything.

1047
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 I will make you become a swine.

1048
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
