1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How was it, Alfa?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What did they say?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I waited for them

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They said they could sense the blood of the 8th Prince

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You used Borgoni, Aldebaran's hand

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So he couldn't go anywhere

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The fire guard will come and take him away from the fire

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Catch him

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, sir

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me go

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you, sir

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm so happy, sir

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because from today, I'm the headmaster of this school

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Good, I called the school earlier

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I want to talk to Professor Aldebaran

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But first, who should I talk to?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Anggara

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Professor Anggara

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Soldiers, this is the Segai Sentara

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Soldiers, I'm thirsty

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Where's the river? I want to drink

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We have to keep flying

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We can't stop

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you're thirsty, use the water fang mantra

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That was given by our professor

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, soldiers

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Water fang

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's going on? Why are we gathered here in the morning?

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Maybe there's another selection

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We have to win

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, we have to win, Tom

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I agree, we have to win

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Love with a smile

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Good morning, kids

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good morning, sir

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We're all here because Professor Aldebaran gave me a letter

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He wants to give you all an important message

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Good morning, everyone

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Anggara, why are you here?

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not here to invite you to war

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I want to give you important information

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If we start today, I'll be the head of the school

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's not funny

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You better tell me where Professor Aldebaran is

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Aldebaran has retired

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's no longer the head of the school

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're lying

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You don't believe me?

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the truth

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's Professor Aldebaran's toxin, Brock

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes, Professor Jasmine

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right, it's Professor Aldebaran's

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This toxin is proof that Aldebaran is no longer the head of the school

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And he has resigned

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Impossible

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Professor Aldebaran would never resign to a cunning and evil person like you

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Resigning doesn't have to be a good thing

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But sometimes it's better to do it in a cruel way

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How dare you hurt Professor Aldebaran?

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll break you!

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Enough, Agni

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Just resign

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because the power you have is not as good as mine

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You lose

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you for the smile

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't let this go

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The magic of the devil

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wow, that's cool

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What is that?

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let me see

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Aaaaah

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Antara

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Attack me

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Our professor is good at dodging

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, he's good at dodging

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We meet again, Antara

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Watch this

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Look at that

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Professor Antara is now a fool

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Aaaaaah

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're too much, Antara

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's just a kid

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're too much, Antara

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's just a kid

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're too much, Antara

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's just a kid

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're too much, Antara

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He's just a kid

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're too much, Antara

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's just a kid

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're too much, Antara

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He's just a kid

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're too much, Antara

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's just a kid

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're too much, Antara

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's just a kid

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're too much, Antara

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's just a kid

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're too much, Antara

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He's just a kid

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're too much, Antara

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's just a kid

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're too much, Antara

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's just a kid

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're too much, Antara

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's just a kid

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're too much, Antara

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He's just a kid

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're too much, Antara

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's just a kid

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're too much, Antara

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He's just a kid

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're too much, Antara

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's just a kid

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're too much, Antara

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's just a kid

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're too much, Antara

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's just a kid

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're too much, Antara

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He's just a kid

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're too much, Antara

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He's just a kid

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're too much, Antara

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's just a kid

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're too much, Antara

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He's just a kid

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're too much, Antara

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's just a kid

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're too much, Antara

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's just a kid

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're too much, Antara

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's just a kid

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're too much, Antara

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He's just a kid

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're too much, Antara

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He's just a kid

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is everyone ready?

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes, sir

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, wait

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Where are you, Al?

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Answer my question, where are you, Alfa?

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry, Dad

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry, Al

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I failed to find the cure for the darkness

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I promise

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will get the cure for the darkness

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I will bring you both back to life

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mom, Dad

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry, Dad

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Alfa

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you really want to find the cure for the darkness?

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Then, go home with your parents

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Go back to your parents

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Go

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't want to

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I want to protect my parents

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
For that matter

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Trust me

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I will protect them

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Trust me

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Trust me, Alfa

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Even though you're still here

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It won't change anything

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They will never wake up, Alfa

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They will never wake up

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Except

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If you have the cure for the darkness

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's the key

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now, look at me

182
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Stay with me

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You have to go home

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Fight Ankara

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Defeat him with the other students

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you succeed in defeating him

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He will tell you how to fight the darkness

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now, go

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Goodbye, Dad

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Alfa

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm sorry, Dad

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's okay

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm here

194
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Realization that...

195
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I will look for a way out of this.

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because I will live a life of hate, jealous.

197
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm tired of asking her to go home.

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
If Alfa doesn't want to go home, let her stay here.

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's go home.

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wait, Bro.

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going home too.

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yes.

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And I ask you, teacher.

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Take good care of them.

205
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes!

206
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Alfa, you're lucky to be with us.

207
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If not, it's not crowded.

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, we have to act as five, right?

209
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

210
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes, Mommy.

211
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, good, Alfa.

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It turns out you still have a good mind.

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And you, Panji.

214
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You don't have to teach me.

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm their teacher.

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, kids.

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Everyone, get ready.

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Come on.

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't leave me and my mother.

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course, Alfa.

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Alfa.

222
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,760
Hi, I'm ready. See you soon, sir.

223
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,480
See you soon.

224
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,880
All together on three!

225
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,960
One, two, three, fly, fly!

226
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:59,360
Bye, sir!

227
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:12,640
Professor Aldebaran?

228
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Professor?

229
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:27,640
[music]

230
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Hello, Professor Agni.

231
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Angkara, why are you here?

232
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Now tell me where you hid Professor Aldebaran.

233
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Agni, don't be so rude.

234
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Isn't it obvious?

235
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,640
The head of the magic school is in my hands now.

236
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,640
And this means I'm the official head of the magic school.

237
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
No.

238
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Until this moment, Professor Aldebaran is still in office as the official head of the school.

239
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,640
And you, you're no one, Angkara.

240
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Agni, don't be mad like this.

241
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
If you're mad, you won't be pretty anymore.

242
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Agni, how about this?

243
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
How about we work together?

244
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Then I'll give you a position as the head of the school.

245
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
How about that?

246
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Thank you, Angkara.

247
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
But I don't want to work with a stupid traitor like you.

248
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
What did you say?

249
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,640
If it's not stupid, then what is it?

250
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,640
You want to work with me as the follower of the prince of darkness?

251
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Agni, it's up to you what you want to say.

252
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,640
What's clear is that I will follow you.

253
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,640
If I'm more worthy of being the head of the magic school here.

254
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Come on.

255
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Welcome to the fire prison.

256
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Once you enter it, you can't get out.

257
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm trapped.

258
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Let me go.

259
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Oh my God, it's so hot in here.

260
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Hurry up. Get in.

261
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Let me go.

262
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Please, I'm not guilty.

263
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Let me go.

264
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:53,640
From today, I officially work as the head of the magic school.

265
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,640
And Aldebaran has been locked up in the fire prison.

266
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
He can't get out of there.

267
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Good, Ambaran.

268
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Now Aldebaran is no longer in danger.

269
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,640
And your job is to teach the black magic to the children.

270
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
So they all join my team.

271
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Yes, sir.

272
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Finally, everyone in the magic school obeys my order.

273
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Good.

274
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,640
I can't wait to see the classroom and the classroom.

275
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
The color has changed to black.

276
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Just like the dark magic.

277
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Come on, kids. You're faster at doing the magic.

278
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Smile.

279
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,640
You have to finish this job.

280
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Yes, sir.

281
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
What's this?

282
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,640
How's the job?

283
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Is the professor satisfied with the paint?

284
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Satisfied with what?

285
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
I told you to paint it black.

286
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Why is it pink?

287
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes, yes.

288
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Give me a smile, professor.

289
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Pink is the color.

290
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
The job is done.

291
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Please see the result, sir.

292
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,640
You're a coward.

293
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I told you to paint it black, not pink.

294
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
What, sir?

295
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Give me a smile.

296
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Yellow, sir.

297
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
So the professor asked for yellow.

298
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
We're in the wrong, Professor Jasmine.

299
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
What are you going to do?

300
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Wait, wait.

301
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
You're playing with me.

302
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Then I'll tie you up.

303
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I'll put you in jail.

304
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
No, sir.

305
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,640
He's one of them.

306
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Kids, attack him.

307
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Vega, Plita.

308
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Let's go.

309
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Ray, Tole.

310
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Let's go.

311
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Alfa.

312
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Let's go.

313
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Let's attack together.

314
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
One, two, three.

315
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Let's go.

316
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
He's a coward.

317
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Alfa.

318
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Alfa again.

319
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
What's wrong with him?

320
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Is there anyone else?

321
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Let Professor Debaran go.

322
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,640
After that, leave this school.

323
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Don't come back.

324
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Yes, if he leaves, I'll make him sit on the grass.

325
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Let's go.

326
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
You can do it.

327
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm sorry, sir.

328
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
I'm sorry.

329
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:33,640
You're too late.

330
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Aldebaran is already somewhere.

331
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
And he's my enemy.

332
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,640
If you dare to attack me,

333
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
I'll make sure...

334
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Aldebaran will never come back here.

335
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,640
You're so arrogant.

336
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
You dare to attack me?

337
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Go ahead.

338
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
I'm sorry.

339
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
What should we do?

340
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Where should we go?

341
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Vivi.

342
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Alfa.

343
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Alfa is here.

344
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Where is he?

345
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Listen, everyone.

346
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,640
I'm the head of this school.

347
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640
So, you have to follow my order.

348
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
If you don't,

349
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,640
there will be only three of you in Aldebaran.

350
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Everyone.

351
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
You have to paint it black.

352
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Not pink.

353
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Yes, sir.

354
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,640
How far are we?

355
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Well.

356
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,640
We're only 10.000 km away.

357
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,640
That's still a long way, sir.

358
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
We're exhausted.

359
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
We're sleepy.

360
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Can we take a break?

361
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640
If you want to take a break,

362
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
you can take a nap.

363
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
You can.

364
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
As long as you sleep on the tolipop.

365
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,640
And don't fall.

366
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,640
If you fall, I won't be responsible.

367
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
What is that?

368
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:47,640
This is bad.

369
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Get up.

370
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Sleepyhead, wake up.

371
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Don't sleep.

372
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,640
What is that?

373
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Wake up. Don't sleep.

374
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Look.

375
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
It's dangerous in front of you.

376
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Wake up.

377
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Turn around.

378
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
It's dangerous.

379
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Turn around.

380
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Hurry up.

381
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
We're going to be surrounded.

382
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Watch out.

383
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
The rail is getting closer.

384
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Hurry up.

385
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
We're going to be surrounded.

386
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I got confused.

387
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
It's written in the book.

388
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Tornado, don't surround us.

389
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Please.

390
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,640
Help!

391
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Gamma.

392
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
I'm lost.

393
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
You're awake.

394
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,640
But, how?

395
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Panji, go.

396
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
What? Go?

397
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Go, Panji.

398
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Leave us.

399
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
But...

400
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Gamma is right.

401
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Go to the magic school.

402
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Save Alfa.

403
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,640
What if I'm left alone with you?

404
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
We'd better stay here...

405
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
so that Virgo can take care of us.

406
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Hurry up, Panji.

407
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Alfa is in danger.

408
00:28:38,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Don't.

409
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Alfa.

410
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
You said the right passport.

411
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Please, come in.

412
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:18,640
It's just a dream.

413
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm not sure if I can make it.

414
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,640
It's just a dream.

415
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,640
But, why does it feel so real?

416
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Why did Gamma and Aquila ask me to go to the magic school?

417
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Why did they ask me to protect Alfa?

418
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
What's really going on?

419
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:17,640
But, it's getting dark.

420
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
What should we do?

421
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
If we fight,

422
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
the professor will get hurt.

423
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I want to be an ice.

424
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Let's be an ice fairy...

425
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
so that I can eat.

426
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
The ice fairy's arm is so big.

427
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I thought we're going to the magic school.

428
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
I don't want to.

429
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
It's a must.

430
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm tired of being an ice fairy.

431
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
(The magic school)

432
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:02,640
What's wrong, Tole?

433
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Tole.

434
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
What are you doing?

435
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
What's wrong with you?

436
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,640
Tole, wake up!

437
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:31,640
I smell something.

438
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
It's like a chicken.

439
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
And a scorpion.

440
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm going to be an ice fairy.

441
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm tired.

442
00:31:42,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Virgo.

443
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm leaving.

444
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Please, protect Gamma and Aquila.

445
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Give them the pearl every day.

446
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Okay.

447
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,640
I'll give them to you.

448
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,640
I'll be back soon.

449
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:30,640
(The magic school)

450
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
That's a wound mark.

451
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:15,640
With this wound mark...

452
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,640
...Gamma and Aquila will be safe.

453
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
If someone tries to hurt me...

454
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
...I'll know.

455
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
And I'll come to their rescue.

456
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:42,640
I need water!

457
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
I'm thirsty!

458
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Guard!

459
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Help!

460
00:33:48,640 --> 00:34:02,640
(We can do it)

461
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Where are we going?

462
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
I don't know.

463
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Let's go.

464
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
You're so enthusiastic.

465
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
You were so weak.

466
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
I know.

467
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,640
I want to eat.

468
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Eat?

469
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Yes.

470
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Where are you going to eat?

471
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
We still have an hour.

472
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
I don't need to.

473
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
I'll eat.

474
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,640
With cookies.

475
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Eat a lot.

476
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
You're fat.

477
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
We'll eat everything.

478
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,640
I'll eat cookies.

479
00:34:51,640 --> 00:35:00,640
What's this?

480
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Who dares to eat my food?

481
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Who?

482
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
(I'm hungry)

483
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:22,640
This is called temptation.

484
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Who dares to eat my food?

485
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
This means...

486
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,640
...he's under heavy punishment.

487
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Yes.

488
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,640
No one dares to insult me as the head of the school.

489
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,640
This is scary.

490
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Luckily, I didn't eat it.

491
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,640
If I did, I could be thinned out.

492
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,640
This is scary.

493
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm falling.

494
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,640
I'm not a pig.

495
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,640
This is not a pig.

496
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,640
It's a cockroach.

497
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
What are you talking about?

498
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
I'll stab you.

499
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Why are you running?

500
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,640
I saw Professor Angkara was angry.

501
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,640
It was scary.

502
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Angry?

503
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Why?

504
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Attention, teachers and students.

505
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Gather in the classroom.

506
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Once again.

507
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
I'm Professor Angkara.

508
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,640
The head of the magic school.

509
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Gather in the classroom.

510
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,640
For all the students and teachers.

511
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Hurry.

512
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
What's the matter?

513
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
He's always angry.

514
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Let's go to the classroom.

515
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:17,640
What now?

516
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
We're not...

517
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
Oh my God.

518
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,640
This must be because of...

519
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Oh my God.

520
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
This is scary.

521
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
What should we do?

522
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
What's wrong?

523
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,640
I heard Professor Angkara was angry.

524
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Because the food was taken by someone.

525
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
It was eaten by someone else.

526
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
He said,

527
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,640
if anyone eats the food, they will be punished.

528
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,640
I prayed.

529
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
It's not you who ate it.

530
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Tole, it's not you, right?

531
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Yes, it's me.

532
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Be honest.

533
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Don't lie.

534
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
It's not me.

535
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Answer me.

536
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Tole.

537
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
It's not you, right?

538
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,640
It's not me.

539
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,640
I don't want you to be punished.

540
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Let's go to the classroom.

541
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Okay.

542
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Oh my God.

543
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
What should we do?

544
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
Please, Tole.

545
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,640
It's so hot in here.

546
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Water.

547
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
I'm thirsty.

548
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I need water.

549
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
I don't have a bucket.

550
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,640
I can't get water.

551
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Guard.

552
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Guard, please.

553
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm thirsty.

554
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,640
I need water.

555
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
I'm thirsty.

556
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Guard.

557
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,640
Please.

558
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm thirsty.

559
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Tole.

560
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Water.

561
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,640
It's useless to shout.

562
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,640
They will never come.

563
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Sir.

564
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
If I may know...

565
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
...why are you...

566
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,640
...able to stay in a place like this?

567
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,640
It's not hot.

568
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,640
For that...

569
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,640
...you have to master the knowledge of soul conservation.

570
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Knowledge of soul conservation?

571
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,640
What is that, sir?

572
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,640
There are two sides of life in this world.

573
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Good.

574
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Evil.

575
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Healthy.

576
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
Sick.

577
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Hot.

578
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
And cold.

579
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,640
When one of them is over...

580
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,640
...the result won't be good.

581
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Because of that...

582
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,640
...you need the balance of the soul.

583
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
A balanced soul...

584
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,640
...will release...

585
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,640
...the aura in your body.

586
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
So that...

587
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
...the heat won't be felt.

588
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,640
So, from that...

589
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,640
...you need the balance of the soul.

590
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
And you won't...

591
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,640
...feel the heat anymore.

592
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Sir.

593
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Can you...

594
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,640
...teach me the balance of the soul?

595
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,640
[The balance of the soul]

596
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Quiet!

597
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Listen, everyone.

598
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,640
I gathered you here...

599
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
...because there's a thief in this school.

600
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Thief?

601
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,640
That thief...

602
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
...has eaten my food.

603
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Because of that...

604
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,640
...I ask for the thief to confess and move forward.

605
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Yes, sir.

606
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,640
I will count to ten...

607
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,640
...and if no one confesses...

608
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,640
...then everyone will be punished.

609
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Confess, quick!

610
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
Yes, confess!

611
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,640
Confess!

612
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Who ate it?

613
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
You're always finding fault in me.

614
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
I don't know.

615
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,640
One.

616
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Two.

617
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Three.

618
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Four.

619
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,640
Confess.

620
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
This is a trivial matter.

621
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Just because of the food...

622
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,640
...I can ask you to cook a lot of food for the guests.

623
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,640
This is a school...

624
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
...that teaches discipline.

625
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Not to be a thief!

626
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Five.

627
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Confess!

628
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Six.

629
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Seven.

630
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Eight.

631
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,640
Confess!

632
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I ate it!

633
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:40,640
You ate it!

634
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Don't be weird.

635
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
You haven't eaten anything.

636
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,640
I'm sorry.

637
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
It's my fault.

638
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I'll cook now.

639
00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I'm sorry, professor.

640
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
I ate it.

641
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:54,640
How are you?

642
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
Are you okay?

643
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,640
I'm fine, soldier.

644
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,640
I'm a soldier.

645
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
How about you?

646
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,640
I'm just a soldier.

647
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
What about you?

648
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,640
I'm a soldier.

649
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,640
It's better if you're alone.

650
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Try me.

651
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
This is a supernatural phenomenon.

652
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Spontaneous, enchanting, romantic.

653
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Asmurat.

654
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,640
The disease lies here.

655
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,640
It's so bad.

656
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Soldier.

657
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
The cactus is so big.

658
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
It's scary.

659
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,640
This is a cactus.

660
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
I think the cactus is the one who's going to be the king.

661
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,640
If it's here, we can see it.

662
00:45:48,640 --> 00:46:02,640
I think it's not friendly.

663
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,640
Watch out. What is it throwing?

664
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Watch out.

665
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,640
It's moving.

666
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
The cactus is moving.

667
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:25,640
It's broken.

668
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
Soldier, what should we do?

669
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Our club is broken because of the cactus.

670
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,640
The cactus can talk.

671
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
It can talk.

672
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,640
The cactus has a cactus salon.

673
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
There's a lady on the table.

674
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,640
I'm sorry, cactus.

675
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
We didn't mean to.

676
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,640
Yes, we didn't mean to.

677
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,640
It's angry.

678
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,640
It's showing its tail.

679
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,640
Watch out.

680
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:18,640
I forgot that we have a fireman in our school.

681
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,640
I'm sorry, too.

682
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,640
But, Sir.

683
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
I'm sorry.

684
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:38,640
You like to eat, don't you?

685
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,640
Alright.

686
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,640
If that's the case, I'll give you a punishment that you like.

687
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,640
We'll cut the table.

688
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Please eat all of these, Alfa.

689
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
Why, Alfa?

690
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,640
Why did you admit that all of these are not poisoned?

691
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:46,640
If I knew that I was going to be eaten, I wouldn't have been punished.

692
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,640
But you have to listen to the rules.

693
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,640
You have to finish all of these.

694
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
No one is allowed to be left.

695
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,640
If anyone is left, you'll be punished severely.

696
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:33,640
Now, calm down.

697
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
Forget your worries.

698
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,640
And forget your fears, too.

699
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,640
Think about the beautiful things in your life.

700
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Now, take a deep breath.

701
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:53,640
Let out your breath.

702
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,640
Get rid of all the burdens.

703
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:13,640
How do you feel?

704
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,640
Better?

705
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,640
You're right.

706
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,640
I don't feel the heat anymore.

707
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,640
If it's like this, I think I can survive here.

708
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Thank you very much, sir.

709
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,640
They're coming soon!

710
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,640
Where are they?

711
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,640
It's already 9 o'clock. They'll be here soon.

712
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
Who are they, sir?

713
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,640
Hey! Let him go! Don't hurt him!

714
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,640
I can't interfere, professor.

715
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,640
Soon, your time will come.

716
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,640
Dad! Dad! Dad!

717
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,640
Alfa! Alfa!

718
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,640
Oh, no.

719
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,640
It's so hot.

720
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
It's so bad. What should we do?

721
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,640
Alfa, why did you stop?

722
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,640
If you stop and spit out all the food,

723
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,640
you'll get a worse punishment.

724
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Alfa, I'm sure he's full.

725
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,640
Alfa, we have to help Alfa.

726
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,640
But, he's starting to walk.

727
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:15,640
Hey, don't go! I'll take care of him.

728
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:38,640
Alfa, I'll take care of him.

729
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,640
Oh, so you want to be the leader of the lunatics, Tole.

730
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,640
Bro, let me go!

731
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,640
Come on.

732
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,640
Who else wants to be a hero like Tole?

733
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Then, he'll be fished.

734
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,640
And will be given to the raptor to be fed.

735
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,640
Come on, Alfa.

736
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,640
Stop, Alfa.

737
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,640
So, I can torture you.

738
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,640
Hey, who are you?

739
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,640
You, you!

740
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,640
Catch him!

741
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,640
You have to hold on.

742
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,640
Come on, get up.

743
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,640
Get up.

744
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,640
Eat this.

745
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Come on, eat.

746
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,640
Chocolate.

747
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,640
Chocolate will make you happy.

748
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,640
And will protect you from the attack of the Ruputala Guard and the Fire Police.

749
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,640
The Fire Police will take your good emotions.

750
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,640
Spend all your good emotions with this chocolate.

751
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,640
You will hold on.

752
00:55:53,640 --> 00:56:02,640
How is it?

753
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Thank you, Sir.

754
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:20,640
I'm not strong anymore.

755
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
I can't.

756
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,640
I can't finish all this food.

757
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,640
So, this is the meaning of Gama and Aguliela that I ordered to come.

758
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
Hakara.

759
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,640
You are really too much.

760
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,640
How dare you to betray Alfa.

761
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:57,640
It's okay.

762
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:12,640
What is this?

763
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,640
Why did I suddenly wake up?

764
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,640
And why am I hungry again?

765
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:34,640
Alfa.

766
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
Eat all of this.

767
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,640
Alfa.

768
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,640
Finish it.

769
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,640
Alfa.

770
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Your body is small, but your intestines are long.

771
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,640
And your intestines are amazing. Full of smile.

772
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,640
Shut up, all of you.

773
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,640
Alfa.

774
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,640
You won this time.

775
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,640
But next time, I will make you lose.

776
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,640
And I will give you a heavier punishment.

777
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,640
Buffet, pass me the rope.

778
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,640
Thank you, Sir.

779
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,640
Alfa.

780
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:15,640
Sir, don't.

781
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Don't touch me.

782
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Sir, why are you here?

783
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
I want to see your room, Hakara.

784
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,640
Why are you still keeping my bones?

785
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,640
As a souvenir, Sir.

786
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,640
Because I have defeated Panji.

787
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,640
How far have you taught your children?

788
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,640
To teach them, Sir.

789
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,640
But I have managed to persuade all the children and teachers...

790
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,640
...to paint the classroom and classroom walls black, Sir.

791
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,640
And starting tomorrow, I will teach them black science, Sir.

792
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,640
Why do you always delay the children?

793
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,640
I need the rope as soon as possible.

794
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,640
Teach the children right now.

795
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Yes, Sir.

796
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:15,640
Damn it.

797
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,640
He's coming.

798
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,640
Hey, who are you?

799
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Who are you?

800
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,640
I'm going to kill you.

801
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:31,640
No.

802
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Where is that person?

803
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,640
Turn around.

804
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,640
I'm going to break your bones.

805
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
Yes, me too.

806
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,640
There he is, Boss.

807
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Chase him.

808
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,640
What's this?

809
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:26,640
My head hurts.

810
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,640
What's wrong, Boss?

811
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:47,640
No, I don't want to.

812
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,640
What? Hurry up and do it.

813
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,640
No, I don't want to. He's my friend.

814
01:01:52,640 --> 01:02:09,640
We can do it.

815
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:32,640
What are you doing?

816
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,640
I'm sorry, Sir.

817
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,640
There was a thief who broke into our school, Sir.

818
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Yes, Sir.

819
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
He broke in there.

820
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,640
We chased him inside.

821
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,640
There were three heads inside, Sir.

822
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,640
Yes, Sir.

823
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
What did he look like?

824
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,640
He wore a red shirt.

825
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,640
He had a moustache.

826
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,640
He wore a black jacket, Sir.

827
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,640
He wore a orange shirt.

828
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
He was wearing a man's shirt.

829
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
A man's shirt?

830
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
Yes, Sir.

831
01:03:07,640 --> 01:08:11,640
We're going to break his bones.

832
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,640
He's my friend.

833
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,640
Your friend?

834
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,640
Alright.

835
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,640
Then, you stay here.

836
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:27,640
Tommy!

837
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,640
Come here.

838
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,640
Be careful.

839
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,640
What did you just do?

840
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,640
And where is your intention towards Alfa?

841
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:54,640
Angkara!

842
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,640
Stop!

843
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,640
I'm not going to do anything.

844
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,640
I'm going to kill you.

845
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,640
Stop!

846
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,640
Stop right here.

847
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,640
Don't force me to hurt you.

848
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,640
Sir, I don't like to be disturbed.

849
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,640
If you don't accept it,

850
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,640
it means you're letting me hurt Alfa.

851
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,640
Do you want that?

852
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,640
[Tommy is being tortured.]

853
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:43,640
Tommy, do it quickly.

854
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,640
Yes, Sir.

855
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,640
Let's go, Tommy.

856
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,640
Go!

857
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,640
Run!

858
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:32,640
[Tommy is being tortured.]

859
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,640
Angkara, it's impossible.

860
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,640
Angkara, calm down.

861
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:59,640
[Tommy is being tortured.]

862
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:23,640
[To be continued...]

863
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:34,280
Never give up, chase the passion and dreams

864
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,720
Go.. go.. go, achieve all your dreams

865
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,320
Go.. go.. go, never ever stop

866
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:47,560
Go.. go.. go, fight with your heart

867
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,480
Go.. go.. go, make yourself proud

868
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,080
Go.. go.. go, let's dream

869
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:00,040
Go.. go.. go, we will be sure
