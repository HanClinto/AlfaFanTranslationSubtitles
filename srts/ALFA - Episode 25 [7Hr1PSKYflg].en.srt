 To be continued...

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 To be continued...

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000

 To be continued...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 How was it, Alva?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 What did they say?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I waited for them

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 They said they could sense the blood of the 8th Prince

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You used Borgoni, Aldebaran's hand

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So he couldn't go anywhere

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 The fire guard will come and take him away from the fire

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Catch him

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Yes, sir

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Let me go

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Thank you, sir

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I'm so happy, sir

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Because from today, I'm the headmaster of this school

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Good, I called the school earlier

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And I want to talk to Professor Aldebaran

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But first, who should I talk to?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Anggara

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Professor Anggara

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Professor Anggara

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Soldiers, this is the Segai Sentara

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Soldiers, I'm thirsty

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Where's the river? I want to drink

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 We have to keep flying

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We can't stop

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 If you're thirsty, use the water fang mantra

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 That was given by our professor

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Okay, soldiers

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Water fang

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Water fang

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Water fang

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 What's going on? Why are we gathered here in the morning?

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Maybe there's another selection

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 We have to win

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Yes, we have to win, Tom

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I agree, we have to win

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Love with a smile

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Good morning, kids

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Good morning, sir

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We're all here because Professor Aldebaran gave me a letter

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 He wants to give you all an important message

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Good morning, everyone

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Anggara, why are you here?

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I'm not here to invite you to war

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 But I want to give you important information

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 If we start today, I'll be the head of the school

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 What?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 That's not funny

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 You better tell me where Professor Aldebaran is

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Aldebaran has retired

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 He's no longer the head of the school

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 You're lying

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You don't believe me?

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 This is the truth

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 That's Professor Aldebaran's toxin, Brock

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Yes, Professor Jasmine

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 That's right, it's Professor Aldebaran's

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 This toxin is proof that Aldebaran is no longer the head of the school

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And he has resigned

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Impossible

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Professor Aldebaran would never resign to a cunning and evil person like you

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Resigning doesn't have to be a good thing

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 But sometimes it's better to do it in a cruel way

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 How dare you hurt Professor Aldebaran?

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I'll break you!

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Enough, Agni

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Just resign

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Because the power you have is not as good as mine

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 You lose

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Thank you for the smile

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I can't let this go

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 The magic of the devil

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Wow, that's cool

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 What is that?

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Let me see

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Aaaaah

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Antara

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Attack me

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Our professor is good at dodging

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Yes, he's good at dodging

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 We meet again, Antara

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Watch this

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Look at that

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Professor Antara is now a fool

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Aaaaaah

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 You're too much, Antara

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 He's just a kid

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 You're too much, Antara

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 You're too much, Antara

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 He's just a kid

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You're too much, Antara

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 He's just a kid

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 You're too much, Antara

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 He's just a kid

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 You're too much, Antara

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 He's just a kid

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 You're too much, Antara

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 He's just a kid

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 You're too much, Antara

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 You're too much, Antara

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 He's just a kid

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 You're too much, Antara

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 He's just a kid

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You're too much, Antara

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 He's just a kid

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 You're too much, Antara

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 He's just a kid

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 You're too much, Antara

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 He's just a kid

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 You're too much, Antara

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 He's just a kid

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You're too much, Antara

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 He's just a kid

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 You're too much, Antara

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 He's just a kid

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 You're too much, Antara

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 He's just a kid

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 He's just a kid

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 You're too much, Antara

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 He's just a kid

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You're too much, Antara

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 He's just a kid

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 You're too much, Antara

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He's just a kid

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 You're too much, Antara

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 He's just a kid

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 You're too much, Antara

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 He's just a kid

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 You're too much, Antara

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 He's just a kid

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 You're too much, Antara

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 He's just a kid

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 You're too much, Antara

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000

 He's just a kid

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 You're too much, Antara

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 He's just a kid

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Is everyone ready?

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Yes, sir

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Okay, wait

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Where are you, Al?

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Answer my question, where are you, Alfa?

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I'm sorry, Dad

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I'm sorry, Dad

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I'm sorry, Al

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I failed to find the cure for the darkness

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 But I promise

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I will get the cure for the darkness

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And I will bring you both back to life

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Mom, Dad

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 I'm sorry, Dad

175
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I'm sorry, Dad

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I'm sorry, Dad

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I'm sorry, Dad

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Alfa

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Do you really want to find the cure for the darkness?

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yes

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Then, go home with your parents

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Go back to your parents

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Go

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 I don't want to

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I don't want to

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I want to protect my parents

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 For that matter

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Trust me

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I will protect them

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Trust me

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Trust me, Alfa

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Even though you're still here

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It won't change anything

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 They will never wake up, Alfa

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 They will never wake up

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Except

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 If you have the cure for the darkness

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 That's the key

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Now, look at me

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Stay with me

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000

 Fight Ankara

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Defeat him with the other students

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 If you succeed in defeating him

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 He will tell you how to fight the darkness

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Now, go

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000

 I'm sorry, Dad

 I'm sorry, Dad

 I'm sorry, Dad

 I'm sorry, Dad

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I'm sorry, Dad

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I will look for a way out of this.

 I'm tired of asking her to go home.

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 If Alva doesn't want to go home, let her stay here.

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Let's go home.

244
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Wait, Bro.

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I'm going home too.

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Yes.

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And I ask you, teacher.

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Take good care of them.

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Yes!

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Alva, you're lucky to be with us.

251
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 If not, it's not crowded.

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Yes, we have to act as five, right?

253
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Yes.

254
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Yes, Mommy.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Yes, good, Alva.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It turns out you still have a good mind.

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And you, Panji.

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 You don't have to teach me.

259
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I'm their teacher.

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Okay, kids.

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Everyone, get ready.

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Come on.

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Don't leave me and my mother.

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Of course, Alva.

 Alva.

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,760
 Hi, I'm ready. See you soon, sir.

267
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,480
 See you soon.

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,880

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:59,360
 Bye, sir!

271
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:12,640
 Professor Aldebaran?

272
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,640
 Professor?

273
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:27,640
 [music]

274
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
 Hello, Professor Agni.

275
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,640
 Angkara, why are you here?

276
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,640
 Now tell me where you hid Professor Aldebaran.

277
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,640
 Agni, don't be so rude.

278
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
 Isn't it obvious?

279
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,640
 The head of the magic school is in my hands now.

280
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,640
 And this means I'm the official head of the magic school.

281
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
 No.

282
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,640
 Until this moment, Professor Aldebaran is still in office as the official head of the school.

283
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,640
 And you, you're no one, Angkara.

284
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,640
 Agni, don't be mad like this.

285
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
 If you're mad, you won't be pretty anymore.

286
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,640
 Agni, how about this?

287
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
 How about we work together?

288
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
 Then I'll give you a position as the head of the school.

289
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
 How about that?

290
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
 Thank you, Angkara.

291
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 But I don't want to work with a stupid traitor like you.

292
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
 What did you say?

293
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,640
 If it's not stupid, then what is it?

294
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,640
 You want to work with me as the follower of the prince of darkness?

295
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 Agni, it's up to you what you want to say.

296
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,640
 What's clear is that I will follow you.

297
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,640
 If I'm more worthy of being the head of the magic school here.

298
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,640
 Come on.

299
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,640
 Welcome to the fire prison.

300
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 Once you enter it, you can't get out.

301
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,640
 I'm trapped.

302
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,640
 Let me go.

303
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,640
 Oh my God, it's so hot in here.

304
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
 Hurry up. Get in.

305
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,640
 Let me go.

306
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,640
 Please, I'm not guilty.

307
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,640
 Let me go.

308
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:53,640
 From today, I officially work as the head of the magic school.

309
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,640
 And Aldebaran has been locked up in the fire prison.

310
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
 He can't get out of there.

311
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
 Good, Ambaran.

312
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
 Now Aldebaran is no longer in danger.

313
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,640
 And your job is to teach the black magic to the children.

314
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
 So they all join my team.

315
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 Yes, sir.

316
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:30,640
 Finally, everyone in the magic school obeys my order.

317
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
 Good.

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,640
 I can't wait to see the classroom and the classroom.

319
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
 The color has changed to black.

320
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
 Just like the dark magic.

321
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 Come on, kids. You're faster at doing the magic.

322
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 Smile.

323
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,640
 You have to finish this job.

324
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
 Yes, sir.

325
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 What's this?

326
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 How's the job?

327
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
 Is the professor satisfied with the paint?

328
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
 Satisfied with what?

329
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
 I told you to paint it black.

330
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
 Why is it pink?

331
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 Yes, yes.

332
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
 Give me a smile, professor.

333
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
 Pink is the color.

334
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 The job is done.

335
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
 Please see the result, sir.

336
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,640
 You're a coward.

337
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
 I told you to paint it black, not pink.

338
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
 What, sir?

339
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
 Give me a smile.

340
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
 Yellow, sir.

341
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
 So the professor asked for yellow.

342
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
 We're in the wrong, Professor Jasmine.

343
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 What are you going to do?

344
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
 Wait, wait.

345
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
 You're playing with me.

346
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
 Then I'll tie you up.

347
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
 I'll put you in jail.

348
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
 No, sir.

349
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,640
 He's one of them.

350
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 Kids, attack him.

351
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
 Vega, Plita.

352
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
 Let's go.

353
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
 Ray, Tole.

354
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
 Let's go.

355
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,640
 Alva.

356
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
 Let's go.

357
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 Let's attack together.

358
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 One, two, three.

359
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
 Let's go.

360
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
 He's a coward.

361
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:57,640
 Alva.

362
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
 Alva again.

363
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
 What's wrong with him?

364
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
 Is there anyone else?

365
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,640
 Let Professor Debaran go.

366
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,640
 After that, leave this school.

367
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
 Don't come back.

368
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,640
 Yes, if he leaves, I'll make him sit on the grass.

369
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
 Let's go.

370
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
 You can do it.

371
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
 I'm sorry, sir.

372
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
 I'm sorry.

373
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:33,640
 You're too late.

374
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,640
 Aldebaran is already somewhere.

375
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
 And he's my enemy.

376
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,640
 If you dare to attack me,

377
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
 I'll make sure...

378
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,640
 Aldebaran will never come back here.

379
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,640
 You're so arrogant.

380
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
 You dare to attack me?

381
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
 Go ahead.

382
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 I'm sorry.

383
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
 What should we do?

384
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
 Where should we go?

385
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,640
 Vivi.

386
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
 Alva.

387
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
 Alva is here.

388
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
 Where is he?

389
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,640
 Listen, everyone.

390
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,640
 I'm the head of this school.

391
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640
 So, you have to follow my order.

392
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
 If you don't,

393
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,640
 there will be only three of you in Aldebaran.

394
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,640
 Everyone.

395
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
 You have to paint it black.

396
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
 Not pink.

397
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:57,640
 Yes, sir.

398
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,640
 How far are we?

399
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
 Well.

400
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,640
 We're only 10.000 km away.

401
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,640
 That's still a long way, sir.

402
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
 We're exhausted.

403
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
 We're sleepy.

404
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 Can we take a break?

405
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640
 If you want to take a break,

406
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
 you can take a nap.

407
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
 You can.

408
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
 As long as you sleep on the tolipop.

409
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,640
 And don't fall.

410
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,640
 If you fall, I won't be responsible.

411
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
 What is that?

412
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:47,640
 This is bad.

413
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
 Get up.

414
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
 Sleepyhead, wake up.

415
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
 Don't sleep.

416
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
 What is that?

417
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
 What is that?

418
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
 What is that?

419
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
 Wake up. Don't sleep.

420
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
 Look.

421
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
 It's dangerous in front of you.

422
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
 Wake up.

423
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:16,640
 Turn around.

424
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
 It's dangerous.

425
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,640
 Turn around.

426
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
 Hurry up.

427
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,640
 Hurry up.

428
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 We're going to be surrounded.

429
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
 Watch out.

430
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
 The rail is getting closer.

431
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,640
 Hurry up.

432
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
 Hurry up.

433
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
 We're going to be surrounded.

434
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
 I got confused.

435
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
 It's written in the book.

436
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,640
 Tornado, don't surround us.

437
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
 Please.

438
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
 Help!

439
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
 Help!

440
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
 Help!

441
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,640
 To be continued...

442
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,640
 To be continued...

443
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
 To be continued...

444
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,640
 To be continued...

445
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,640
 To be continued...

446
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,640
 To be continued...

447
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,640
 To be continued...

448
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,640
 To be continued...

449
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,640
 Gamma.

450
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
 I'm lost.

451
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
 You're awake.

452
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,640
 But, how?

453
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
 Panji, go.

454
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
 What? Go?

455
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 Go, Panji.

456
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
 Leave us.

457
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
 But...

458
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
 Gamma is right.

459
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 Go to the magic school.

460
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
 Save Alva.

461
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 What if I'm left alone with you?

462
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
 We'd better stay here...

463
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
 so that Virgo can take care of us.

464
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
 Hurry up, Panji.

465
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
 Alva is in danger.

466
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
 Don't.

467
00:28:40,640 --> 00:29:00,640
 Don't.

468
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
 Alva.

469
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
 You said the right passport.

470
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
 Please, come in.

471
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:18,640
 It's just a dream.

472
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,640
 I'm not sure if I can make it.

473
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 I'm not sure if I can make it.

474
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,640
 I'm not sure if I can make it.

475
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,640
 It's just a dream.

476
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,640
 But, why does it feel so real?

477
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:45,640
 Why did Gamma and Aquila ask me to go to the magic school?

478
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,640
 Why did they ask me to protect Alva?

479
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
 What's really going on?

480
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:17,640
 But, it's getting dark.

481
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
 What should we do?

482
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
 If we fight,

483
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 the professor will get hurt.

484
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,640
 I want to be an ice.

485
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,640
 Let's be an ice fairy...

486
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
 so that I can eat.

487
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
 The ice fairy's arm is so big.

488
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
 I thought we're going to the magic school.

489
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
 I don't want to.

490
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
 It's a must.

491
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,640
 I'm tired of being an ice fairy.

492
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
 (The magic school)

493
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:02,640
 What's wrong, Tole?

494
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,640
 Tole.

495
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
 What are you doing?

496
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
 What's wrong with you?

497
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,640
 Tole, wake up!

498
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:31,640
 I smell something.

499
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
 It's like a chicken.

500
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
 And a scorpion.

501
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,640
 I'm going to be an ice fairy.

502
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
 I'm tired.

503
00:31:42,640 --> 00:32:00,640
 Virgo.

504
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
 I'm leaving.

505
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
 Please, protect Gamma and Aquila.

506
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
 Give them the pearl every day.

507
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
 Okay.

508
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,640
 I'll give them to you.

509
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
 I'll be back soon.

510
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
 I'll be back soon.

511
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
 (The magic school)

512
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
 (The magic school)

513
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
 (The magic school)

514
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
 (The magic school)

515
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
 That's a wound mark.

516
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:15,640
 With this wound mark...

517
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,640
 ...Gamma and Aquila will be safe.

518
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
 If someone tries to hurt me...

519
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
 ...I'll know.

520
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
 And I'll come to their rescue.

521
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:42,640
 I need water!

522
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
 I'm thirsty!

523
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
 Guard!

524
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
 Help!

525
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,640
 (We can do it)

526
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,640
 (We can do it)

527
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,640
 (We can do it)

528
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,640
 Where are we going?

529
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
 I don't know.

530
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
 Let's go.

531
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
 You're so enthusiastic.

532
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
 You were so weak.

533
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
 I know.

534
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,640
 I want to eat.

535
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
 Eat?

536
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
 Yes.

537
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
 Where are you going to eat?

538
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
 We still have an hour.

539
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
 I don't need to.

540
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
 I'll eat.

541
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,640
 With cookies.

542
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,640
 Eat a lot.

543
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
 You're fat.

544
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
 We'll eat everything.

545
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 I'll eat cookies.

546
00:34:51,640 --> 00:35:00,640
 What's this?

547
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:08,640
 Who dares to eat my food?

548
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
 Who?

549
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
 (I'm hungry)

550
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:22,640
 This is called temptation.

551
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
 Who dares to eat my food?

552
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
 This means...

553
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,640
 ...he's under heavy punishment.

554
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,640
 Yes.

555
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,640
 No one dares to insult me as the head of the school.

556
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,640
 This is scary.

557
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
 Luckily, I didn't eat it.

558
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,640
 If I did, I could be thinned out.

559
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,640
 This is scary.

560
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
 I'm falling.

561
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,640
 I'm not a pig.

562
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,640
 This is not a pig.

563
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,640
 It's a cockroach.

564
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
 What are you talking about?

565
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
 I'll stab you.

566
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,640
 Why are you running?

567
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,640
 I saw Professor Angkara was angry.

568
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,640
 It was scary.

569
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,640
 Angry?

570
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
 Why?

571
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,640
 Attention, teachers and students.

572
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,640
 Gather in the classroom.

573
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
 Once again.

574
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
 I'm Professor Angkara.

575
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,640
 The head of the magic school.

576
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,640
 Gather in the classroom.

577
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,640
 For all the students and teachers.

578
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
 Hurry.

579
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
 What's the matter?

580
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
 He's always angry.

581
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,640
 Let's go to the classroom.

582
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:17,640
 What now?

583
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
 We're not...

584
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
 Oh my God.

585
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,640
 This must be because of...

586
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
 Oh my God.

587
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
 This is scary.

588
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
 What should we do?

589
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
 What's wrong?

590
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,640
 I heard Professor Angkara was angry.

591
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,640
 Because the food was taken by someone.

592
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
 It was eaten by someone else.

593
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
 He said,

594
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,640
 if anyone eats the food, they will be punished.

595
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,640
 I prayed.

596
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
 It's not you who ate it.

597
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,640
 Tole, it's not you, right?

598
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
 Yes, it's me.

599
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
 Be honest.

600
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
 Don't lie.

601
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
 It's not me.

602
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
 Answer me.

603
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
 Tole.

604
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
 Tole.

605
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
 It's not you, right?

606
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,640
 It's not me.

607
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,640
 I don't want you to be punished.

608
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,640
 Let's go to the classroom.

609
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
 Okay.

610
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,640
 Oh my God.

611
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
 What should we do?

612
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
 Please, Tole.

613
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,640
 It's so hot in here.

614
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,640
 Water.

615
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
 I'm thirsty.

616
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
 I need water.

617
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
 I don't have a bucket.

618
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,640
 I can't get water.

619
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,640
 Guard.

620
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,640
 Guard, please.

621
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
 I'm thirsty.

622
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,640
 I need water.

623
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
 I'm thirsty.

624
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,640
 Guard.

625
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
 Please.

626
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
 Please.

627
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,640
 I'm thirsty.

628
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
 Tole.

629
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,640
 Water.

630
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,640
 It's useless to shout.

631
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,640
 They will never come.

632
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,640
 Sir.

633
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
 If I may know...

634
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
 ...why are you...

635
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,640
 ...able to stay in a place like this?

636
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
 It's not hot.

637
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
 It's not hot.

638
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,640
 For that...

639
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,640
 ...you have to master the knowledge of soul conservation.

640
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,640
 Knowledge of soul conservation?

641
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,640
 What is that, sir?

642
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,640
 There are two sides of life in this world.

643
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
 Good.

644
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
 Evil.

645
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
 Healthy.

646
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
 Sick.

647
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
 Hot.

648
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
 And cold.

649
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,640
 When one of them is over...

650
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,640
 ...the result won't be good.

651
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,640
 Because of that...

652
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,640
 ...you need the balance of the soul.

653
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
 A balanced soul...

654
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,640
 ...will release...

655
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,640
 ...the aura in your body.

656
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
 So that...

657
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
 ...the heat won't be felt.

658
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,640
 So, from that...

659
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,640
 ...you need the balance of the soul.

660
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
 And you won't...

661
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,640
 ...feel the heat anymore.

662
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,640
 Sir.

663
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
 Can you...

664
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,640
 ...teach me the balance of the soul?

665
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,640
 [The balance of the soul]

666
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,640
 Quiet!

667
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:34,640
 Listen, everyone.

668
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,640
 I gathered you here...

669
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
 ...because there's a thief in this school.

670
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,640
 Thief?

671
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,640
 That thief...

672
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
 ...has eaten my food.

673
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,640
 Because of that...

674
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,640
 ...I ask for the thief to confess and move forward.

675
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
 Yes, sir.

676
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,640
 I will count to ten...

677
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,640
 ...and if no one confesses...

678
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,640
 ...then everyone will be punished.

679
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
 Confess, quick!

680
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
 Yes, confess!

681
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
 Confess!

682
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
 Confess!

683
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
 Confess!

684
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
 Who ate it?

685
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
 You're always finding fault in me.

686
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
 I don't know.

687
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,640
 One.

688
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,640
 Two.

689
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
 Three.

690
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
 Four.

691
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
 Confess.

692
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,640
 Confess.

693
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
 This is a trivial matter.

694
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
 Just because of the food...

695
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,640
 ...I can ask you to cook a lot of food for the guests.

696
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,640
 This is a school...

697
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
 ...that teaches discipline.

698
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
 Not to be a thief!

699
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,640
 Five.

700
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
 Confess!

701
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
 Six.

702
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
 Seven.

703
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,640
 Eight.

704
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
 Confess!

705
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
 Confess!

706
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
 Confess!

707
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,640
 I ate it!

708
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
 I ate it!

709
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:40,640
 You ate it!

710
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
 Don't be weird.

711
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
 You haven't eaten anything.

712
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,640
 I'm sorry.

713
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
 It's my fault.

714
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,640
 I'll cook now.

715
00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:03,640
 I'm sorry, professor.

716
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
 I ate it.

717
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,640
 To be continued...

718
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
 To be continued...

719
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,640
 To be continued...

720
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,640
 To be continued...

721
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,640
 To be continued...

722
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
 How are you?

723
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,640
 How are you?

724
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
 Are you okay?

725
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,640
 I'm fine, soldier.

726
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,640
 I'm a soldier.

727
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
 How about you?

728
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,640
 I'm just a soldier.

729
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
 What about you?

730
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,640
 I'm a soldier.

731
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,640
 It's better if you're alone.

732
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,640
 Try me.

733
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
 This is a supernatural phenomenon.

734
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,640
 Spontaneous, enchanting, romantic.

735
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
 Asmurat.

736
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,640
 The disease lies here.

737
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,640
 It's so bad.

738
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:36,640
 Soldier.

739
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
 The cactus is so big.

740
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
 It's scary.

741
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,640
 This is a cactus.

742
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
 I think the cactus is the one who's going to be the king.

743
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,640
 If it's here, we can see it.

744
00:45:48,640 --> 00:46:02,640
 I think it's not friendly.

745
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,640
 Watch out. What is it throwing?

746
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,640
 Watch out.

747
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,640
 It's moving.

748
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
 The cactus is moving.

749
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:25,640
 It's broken.

750
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
 Soldier, what should we do?

751
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,640
 Our club is broken because of the cactus.

752
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,640
 The cactus can talk.

753
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
 It can talk.

754
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,640
 The cactus has a cactus salon.

755
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
 There's a lady on the table.

756
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,640
 I'm sorry, cactus.

757
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
 We didn't mean to.

758
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,640
 Yes, we didn't mean to.

759
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,640
 It's angry.

760
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,640
 It's showing its tail.

761
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
 Watch out.

762
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,640
 Watch out.

763
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:18,640
 I forgot that we have a fireman in our school.

764
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,640
 I'm sorry, too.

765
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,640
 But, Sir.

766
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
 I'm sorry.

767
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:38,640
 You like to eat, don't you?

768
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,640
 Alright.

769
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,640
 If that's the case, I'll give you a punishment that you like.

770
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,640
 We'll cut the table.

771
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,640
 Please eat all of these, Alva.

772
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
 Why, Alva?

773
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,640
 Why did you admit that all of these are not poisoned?

774
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:46,640
 If I knew that I was going to be eaten, I wouldn't have been punished.

775
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,640
 But you have to listen to the rules.

776
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,640
 You have to finish all of these.

777
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
 No one is allowed to be left.

778
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,640
 If anyone is left, you'll be punished severely.

779
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,640
 To be continued...

780
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,640
 To be continued...

781
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,640
 To be continued...

782
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:33,640
 Now, calm down.

783
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
 Forget your worries.

784
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,640
 And forget your fears, too.

785
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,640
 Think about the beautiful things in your life.

786
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,640
 Now, take a deep breath.

787
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:53,640
 Let out your breath.

788
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,640
 Get rid of all the burdens.

789
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,640
 To be continued...

790
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:13,640
 How do you feel?

791
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,640
 Better?

792
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,640
 You're right.

793
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,640
 I don't feel the heat anymore.

794
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,640
 If it's like this, I think I can survive here.

795
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,640
 Thank you very much, sir.

796
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,640
 They're coming soon!

797
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,640
 Where are they?

798
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,640
 It's already 9 o'clock. They'll be here soon.

799
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
 Who are they, sir?

800
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,640
 To be continued...

801
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,640
 To be continued...

802
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,640
 To be continued...

803
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,640
 To be continued...

804
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,640
 Hey! Let him go! Don't hurt him!

805
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,640
 I can't interfere, professor.

806
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,640
 Soon, your time will come.

807
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,640
 To be continued...

808
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,640
 Dad! Dad! Dad!

809
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,640
 Alva! Alva!

810
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,640
 Oh, no.

811
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,640
 It's so hot.

812
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
 It's so bad. What should we do?

813
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,640
 Alva, why did you stop?

814
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,640
 If you stop and spit out all the food,

815
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,640
 you'll get a worse punishment.

816
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:40,640
 To be continued...

817
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,640
 Alva, I'm sure he's full.

818
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,640
 Alva, we have to help Alva.

819
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,640
 But, he's starting to walk.

820
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,640
 To be continued...

821
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:15,640
 Hey, don't go! I'll take care of him.

822
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,640
 To be continued...

823
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:38,640
 Alva, I'll take care of him.

824
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,640
 Oh, so you want to be the leader of the lunatics, Tole.

825
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,640
 To be continued...

826
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,640
 To be continued...

827
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,640
 Bro, let me go!

828
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,640
 Come on.

829
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,640
 Who else wants to be a hero like Tole?

830
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,640
 Then, he'll be fished.

831
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,640
 And will be given to the raptor to be fed.

832
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,640
 To be continued...

833
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,640
 Come on, Alva.

834
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,640
 Stop, Alva.

835
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,640
 So, I can torture you.

836
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,640
 To be continued...

837
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,640
 To be continued...

838
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:40,640
 To be continued...

839
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,640
 Hey, who are you?

840
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,640
 You, you!

841
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,640
 Catch him!

842
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,640
 To be continued...

843
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,640
 To be continued...

844
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,640
 You have to hold on.

845
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,640
 Come on, get up.

846
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,640
 Get up.

847
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,640
 Eat this.

848
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,640
 Come on, eat.

849
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,640
 Chocolate.

850
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,640
 Chocolate will make you happy.

851
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,640
 And will protect you from the attack of the Ruputala Guard and the Fire Police.

852
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,640
 The Fire Police will take your good emotions.

853
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,640
 Spend all your good emotions with this chocolate.

854
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,640
 You will hold on.

855
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:53,640
 To be continued...

856
00:55:53,640 --> 00:56:02,640
 How is it?

857
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,640
 Thank you, Sir.

858
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:13,640
 To be continued...

859
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:20,640
 I'm not strong anymore.

860
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
 I can't.

861
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,640
 I can't finish all this food.

862
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,640
 So, this is the meaning of Gama and Aguliela that I ordered to come.

863
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
 Hakara.

864
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,640
 You are really too much.

865
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,640
 How dare you to betray Alva.

866
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:57,640
 It's okay.

867
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,640
 To be continued...

868
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:12,640
 What is this?

869
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,640
 Why did I suddenly wake up?

870
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,640
 And why am I hungry again?

871
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,640
 Alva.

872
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,640
 Alva.

873
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,640
 Alva.

874
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
 Eat all of this.

875
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,640
 Alva.

876
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,640
 Finish it.

877
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,640
 Alva.

878
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,640
 Your body is small, but your intestines are long.

879
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,640
 And your intestines are amazing. Full of smile.

880
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,640
 Shut up, all of you.

881
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,640
 Alva.

882
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,640
 You won this time.

883
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,640
 But next time, I will make you lose.

884
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,640
 And I will give you a heavier punishment.

885
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,640
 To be continued...

886
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,640
 Buffet, pass me the rope.

887
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,640
 Thank you, Sir.

888
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,640
 Alva.

889
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,640
 To be continued...

890
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:54,640
 To be continued...

891
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:00,640
 To be continued...

892
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:15,640
 Sir, don't.

893
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
 Don't touch me.

894
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,640
 Sir, why are you here?

895
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
 I want to see your room, Hakara.

896
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,640
 Why are you still keeping my bones?

897
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,640
 As a souvenir, Sir.

898
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,640
 Because I have defeated Panji.

899
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,640
 How far have you taught your children?

900
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,640
 To teach them, Sir.

901
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,640
 But I have managed to persuade all the children and teachers...

902
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,640
 ...to paint the classroom and classroom walls black, Sir.

903
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,640
 And starting tomorrow, I will teach them black science, Sir.

904
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,640
 Why do you always delay the children?

905
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,640
 I need the rope as soon as possible.

906
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,640
 Teach the children right now.

907
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,640
 Yes, Sir.

908
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:15,640
 Damn it.

909
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,640
 He's coming.

910
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,640
 Hey, who are you?

911
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
 Who are you?

912
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,640
 I'm going to kill you.

913
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:31,640
 No.

914
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,640
 Where is that person?

915
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,640
 Turn around.

916
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,640
 I'm going to break your bones.

917
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
 Yes, me too.

918
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,640
 There he is, Boss.

919
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,640
 Chase him.

920
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,640
 What's this?

921
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:26,640
 My head hurts.

922
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,640
 What's wrong, Boss?

923
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:47,640
 No, I don't want to.

924
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,640
 What? Hurry up and do it.

925
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,640
 No, I don't want to. He's my friend.

926
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,640
 We can do it.

927
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:07,640
 We can do it.

928
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,640
 We can do it.

929
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:32,640
 What are you doing?

930
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,640
 I'm sorry, Sir.

931
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,640
 There was a thief who broke into our school, Sir.

932
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,640
 Yes, Sir.

933
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
 He broke in there.

934
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,640
 We chased him inside.

935
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,640
 There were three heads inside, Sir.

936
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,640
 Yes, Sir.

937
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
 What did he look like?

938
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,640
 He wore a red shirt.

939
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,640
 He had a moustache.

940
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,640
 He wore a black jacket, Sir.

941
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,640
 He wore a orange shirt.

942
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
 He was wearing a man's shirt.

943
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
 A man's shirt?

944
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
 Yes, Sir.

945
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,640
 We're going to break his bones.

946
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,640
 We're going to break his bones.

947
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,640
 We're going to break his bones.

948
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,640
 We're going to break his bones.

949
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,640
 We're going to break his bones.

950
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,640
