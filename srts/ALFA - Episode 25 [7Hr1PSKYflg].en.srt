1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How was it, Alva?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What did they say?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I waited for them

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They said they could sense the blood of the 8th Prince

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You used Borgoni, Aldebaran's hand

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So he couldn't go anywhere

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The fire guard will come and take him away from the fire

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Catch him

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, sir

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me go

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you, sir

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm so happy, sir

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because from today, I'm the headmaster of this school

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Good, I called the school earlier

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I want to talk to Professor Aldebaran

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But first, who should I talk to?

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Anggara

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Professor Anggara

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Soldiers, this is the Segai Sentara

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Soldiers, I'm thirsty

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Where's the river? I want to drink

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We have to keep flying

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We can't stop

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you're thirsty, use the water fang mantra

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That was given by our professor

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, soldiers

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Water fang

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's going on? Why are we gathered here in the morning?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Maybe there's another selection

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We have to win

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, we have to win, Tom

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I agree, we have to win

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Love with a smile

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Good morning, kids

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good morning, sir

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We're all here because Professor Aldebaran gave me a letter

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He wants to give you all an important message

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Good morning, everyone

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Anggara, why are you here?

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not here to invite you to war

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I want to give you important information

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If we start today, I'll be the head of the school

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's not funny

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You better tell me where Professor Aldebaran is

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Aldebaran has retired

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's no longer the head of the school

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're lying

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You don't believe me?

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the truth

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's Professor Aldebaran's toxin, Brock

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes, Professor Jasmine

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right, it's Professor Aldebaran's

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This toxin is proof that Aldebaran is no longer the head of the school

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And he has resigned

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Impossible

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Professor Aldebaran would never resign to a cunning and evil person like you

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Resigning doesn't have to be a good thing

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But sometimes it's better to do it in a cruel way

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How dare you hurt Professor Aldebaran?

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll break you!

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Enough, Agni

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Just resign

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because the power you have is not as good as mine

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You lose

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you for the smile

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't let this go

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The magic of the devil

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wow, that's cool

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What is that?

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let me see

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Aaaaah

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Antara

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Attack me

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Our professor is good at dodging

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, he's good at dodging

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We meet again, Antara

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Watch this

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Look at that

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Professor Antara is now a fool

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Aaaaaah

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're too much, Antara

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's just a kid

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're too much, Antara

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's just a kid

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're too much, Antara

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's just a kid

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're too much, Antara

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He's just a kid

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're too much, Antara

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's just a kid

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're too much, Antara

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He's just a kid

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're too much, Antara

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's just a kid

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're too much, Antara

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's just a kid

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're too much, Antara

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's just a kid

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're too much, Antara

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He's just a kid

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're too much, Antara

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's just a kid

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're too much, Antara

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's just a kid

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're too much, Antara

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's just a kid

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're too much, Antara

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He's just a kid

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're too much, Antara

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's just a kid

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're too much, Antara

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He's just a kid

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're too much, Antara

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's just a kid

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're too much, Antara

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's just a kid

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're too much, Antara

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's just a kid

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're too much, Antara

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He's just a kid

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're too much, Antara

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He's just a kid

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're too much, Antara

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's just a kid

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're too much, Antara

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He's just a kid

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're too much, Antara

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's just a kid

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're too much, Antara

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's just a kid

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're too much, Antara

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's just a kid

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're too much, Antara

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He's just a kid

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're too much, Antara

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He's just a kid

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is everyone ready?

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes, sir

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, wait

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Where are you, Al?

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Answer my question, where are you, Alfa?

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry, Dad

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry, Al

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I failed to find the cure for the darkness

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I promise

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will get the cure for the darkness

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I will bring you both back to life

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mom, Dad

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry, Dad

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Alfa

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you really want to find the cure for the darkness?

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Then, go home with your parents

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Go back to your parents

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Go

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't want to

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I want to protect my parents

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
For that matter

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Trust me

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I will protect them

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Trust me

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Trust me, Alfa

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Even though you're still here

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It won't change anything

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They will never wake up, Alfa

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They will never wake up

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Except

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If you have the cure for the darkness

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's the key

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now, look at me

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Stay with me

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You have to go home

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Fight Ankara

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Defeat him with the other students

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you succeed in defeating him

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He will tell you how to fight the darkness

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now, go

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Goodbye, Dad

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Alfa

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm sorry, Dad

193
00:13:14,000 --> 00:14:08,000
[Music]

194
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's okay

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm here

196
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Realization that...

197
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I will look for a way out of this.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because I will live a life of hate, jealous.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm tired of asking her to go home.

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
If Alva doesn't want to go home, let her stay here.

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's go home.

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wait, Bro.

203
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going home too.

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yes.

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And I ask you, teacher.

206
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Take good care of them.

207
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes!

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Alva, you're lucky to be with us.

209
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If not, it's not crowded.

210
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, we have to act as five, right?

211
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes, Mommy.

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, good, Alva.

214
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It turns out you still have a good mind.

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And you, Panji.

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You don't have to teach me.

217
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm their teacher.

218
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, kids.

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Everyone, get ready.

220
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Come on.

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't leave me and my mother.

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course, Alva.

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Alva.

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,760
Hi, I'm ready. See you soon, sir.

225
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,480
See you soon.

226
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,880
All together on three!

227
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,960
One, two, three, fly, fly!

228
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:59,360
Bye, sir!

229
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:12,640
Professor Aldebaran?

230
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Professor?

231
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:27,640
[music]

232
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Hello, Professor Agni.

233
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Angkara, why are you here?

234
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Now tell me where you hid Professor Aldebaran.

235
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Agni, don't be so rude.

236
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Isn't it obvious?

237
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,640
The head of the magic school is in my hands now.

238
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,640
And this means I'm the official head of the magic school.

239
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
No.

240
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Until this moment, Professor Aldebaran is still in office as the official head of the school.

241
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,640
And you, you're no one, Angkara.

242
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Agni, don't be mad like this.

243
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
If you're mad, you won't be pretty anymore.

244
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Agni, how about this?

245
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
How about we work together?

246
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Then I'll give you a position as the head of the school.

247
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
How about that?

248
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Thank you, Angkara.

249
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
But I don't want to work with a stupid traitor like you.

250
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
What did you say?

251
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,640
If it's not stupid, then what is it?

252
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,640
You want to work with me as the follower of the prince of darkness?

253
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Agni, it's up to you what you want to say.

254
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,640
What's clear is that I will follow you.

255
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,640
If I'm more worthy of being the head of the magic school here.

256
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Come on.

257
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Welcome to the fire prison.

258
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Once you enter it, you can't get out.

259
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm trapped.

260
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Let me go.

261
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Oh my God, it's so hot in here.

262
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Hurry up. Get in.

263
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Let me go.

264
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Please, I'm not guilty.

265
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Let me go.

266
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:53,640
From today, I officially work as the head of the magic school.

267
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,640
And Aldebaran has been locked up in the fire prison.

268
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
He can't get out of there.

269
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Good, Ambaran.

270
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Now Aldebaran is no longer in danger.

271
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,640
And your job is to teach the black magic to the children.

272
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
So they all join my team.

273
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Yes, sir.

274
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Finally, everyone in the magic school obeys my order.

275
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Good.

276
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,640
I can't wait to see the classroom and the classroom.

277
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
The color has changed to black.

278
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Just like the dark magic.

279
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Come on, kids. You're faster at doing the magic.

280
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Smile.

281
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,640
You have to finish this job.

282
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Yes, sir.

283
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
What's this?

284
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,640
How's the job?

285
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Is the professor satisfied with the paint?

286
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Satisfied with what?

287
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
I told you to paint it black.

288
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Why is it pink?

289
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes, yes.

290
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Give me a smile, professor.

291
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Pink is the color.

292
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
The job is done.

293
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Please see the result, sir.

294
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,640
You're a coward.

295
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I told you to paint it black, not pink.

296
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
What, sir?

297
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Give me a smile.

298
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Yellow, sir.

299
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
So the professor asked for yellow.

300
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
We're in the wrong, Professor Jasmine.

301
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
What are you going to do?

302
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Wait, wait.

303
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
You're playing with me.

304
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Then I'll tie you up.

305
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I'll put you in jail.

306
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
No, sir.

307
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,640
He's one of them.

308
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Kids, attack him.

309
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Vega, Plita.

310
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Let's go.

311
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Ray, Tole.

312
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Let's go.

313
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Alva.

314
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Let's go.

315
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Let's attack together.

316
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
One, two, three.

317
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Let's go.

318
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
He's a coward.

319
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Alva.

320
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Alva again.

321
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
What's wrong with him?

322
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Is there anyone else?

323
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Let Professor Debaran go.

324
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,640
After that, leave this school.

325
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Don't come back.

326
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Yes, if he leaves, I'll make him sit on the grass.

327
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Let's go.

328
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
You can do it.

329
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm sorry, sir.

330
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:33,640
You're too late.

332
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Aldebaran is already somewhere.

333
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
And he's my enemy.

334
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,640
If you dare to attack me,

335
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
I'll make sure...

336
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Aldebaran will never come back here.

337
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,640
You're so arrogant.

338
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
You dare to attack me?

339
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Go ahead.

340
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
What should we do?

342
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Where should we go?

343
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Vivi.

344
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Alva.

345
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Alva is here.

346
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Where is he?

347
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Listen, everyone.

348
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,640
I'm the head of this school.

349
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640
So, you have to follow my order.

350
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
If you don't,

351
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,640
there will be only three of you in Aldebaran.

352
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Everyone.

353
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
You have to paint it black.

354
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Not pink.

355
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Yes, sir.

356
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,640
How far are we?

357
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Well.

358
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,640
We're only 10.000 km away.

359
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,640
That's still a long way, sir.

360
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
We're exhausted.

361
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
We're sleepy.

362
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Can we take a break?

363
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640
If you want to take a break,

364
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
you can take a nap.

365
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
You can.

366
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
As long as you sleep on the tolipop.

367
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,640
And don't fall.

368
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,640
If you fall, I won't be responsible.

369
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
What is that?

370
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:47,640
This is bad.

371
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Get up.

372
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Sleepyhead, wake up.

373
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Don't sleep.

374
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,640
What is that?

375
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Wake up. Don't sleep.

376
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Look.

377
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
It's dangerous in front of you.

378
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Wake up.

379
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Turn around.

380
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
It's dangerous.

381
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Turn around.

382
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Hurry up.

383
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
We're going to be surrounded.

384
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Watch out.

385
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
The rail is getting closer.

386
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Hurry up.

387
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
We're going to be surrounded.

388
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I got confused.

389
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
It's written in the book.

390
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Tornado, don't surround us.

391
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Please.

392
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,640
Help!

393
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:52,640
To be continued...

394
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Gamma.

395
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
I'm lost.

396
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
You're awake.

397
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,640
But, how?

398
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Panji, go.

399
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
What? Go?

400
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Go, Panji.

401
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
Leave us.

402
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
But...

403
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Gamma is right.

404
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Go to the magic school.

405
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Save Alva.

406
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,640
What if I'm left alone with you?

407
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
We'd better stay here...

408
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
so that Virgo can take care of us.

409
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Hurry up, Panji.

410
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Alva is in danger.

411
00:28:38,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Don't.

412
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Alva.

413
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
You said the right passport.

414
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Please, come in.

415
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:18,640
It's just a dream.

416
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm not sure if I can make it.

417
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,640
It's just a dream.

418
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,640
But, why does it feel so real?

419
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Why did Gamma and Aquila ask me to go to the magic school?

420
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Why did they ask me to protect Alva?

421
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
What's really going on?

422
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:17,640
But, it's getting dark.

423
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
What should we do?

424
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
If we fight,

425
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
the professor will get hurt.

426
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I want to be an ice.

427
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Let's be an ice fairy...

428
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
so that I can eat.

429
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
The ice fairy's arm is so big.

430
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I thought we're going to the magic school.

431
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
I don't want to.

432
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
It's a must.

433
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm tired of being an ice fairy.

434
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
(The magic school)

435
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:02,640
What's wrong, Tole?

436
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Tole.

437
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
What are you doing?

438
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
What's wrong with you?

439
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,640
Tole, wake up!

440
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:31,640
I smell something.

441
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
It's like a chicken.

442
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
And a scorpion.

443
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm going to be an ice fairy.

444
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm tired.

445
00:31:42,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Virgo.

446
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm leaving.

447
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Please, protect Gamma and Aquila.

448
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Give them the pearl every day.

449
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Okay.

450
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,640
I'll give them to you.

451
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,640
I'll be back soon.

452
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:30,640
(The magic school)

453
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
That's a wound mark.

454
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:15,640
With this wound mark...

455
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,640
...Gamma and Aquila will be safe.

456
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
If someone tries to hurt me...

457
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
...I'll know.

458
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
And I'll come to their rescue.

459
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:42,640
I need water!

460
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
I'm thirsty!

461
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Guard!

462
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Help!

463
00:33:48,640 --> 00:34:02,640
(We can do it)

464
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Where are we going?

465
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
I don't know.

466
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Let's go.

467
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
You're so enthusiastic.

468
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
You were so weak.

469
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
I know.

470
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,640
I want to eat.

471
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Eat?

472
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Yes.

473
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Where are you going to eat?

474
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
We still have an hour.

475
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
I don't need to.

476
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
I'll eat.

477
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,640
With cookies.

478
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Eat a lot.

479
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
You're fat.

480
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
We'll eat everything.

481
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,640
I'll eat cookies.

482
00:34:51,640 --> 00:35:00,640
What's this?

483
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Who dares to eat my food?

484
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Who?

485
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
(I'm hungry)

486
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:22,640
This is called temptation.

487
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Who dares to eat my food?

488
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
This means...

489
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,640
...he's under heavy punishment.

490
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Yes.

491
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,640
No one dares to insult me as the head of the school.

492
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,640
This is scary.

493
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Luckily, I didn't eat it.

494
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,640
If I did, I could be thinned out.

495
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,640
This is scary.

496
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm falling.

497
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,640
I'm not a pig.

498
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,640
This is not a pig.

499
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,640
It's a cockroach.

500
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
What are you talking about?

501
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
I'll stab you.

502
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Why are you running?

503
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,640
I saw Professor Angkara was angry.

504
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,640
It was scary.

505
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Angry?

506
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Why?

507
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Attention, teachers and students.

508
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Gather in the classroom.

509
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Once again.

510
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
I'm Professor Angkara.

511
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,640
The head of the magic school.

512
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Gather in the classroom.

513
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,640
For all the students and teachers.

514
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Hurry.

515
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
What's the matter?

516
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
He's always angry.

517
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Let's go to the classroom.

518
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:17,640
What now?

519
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
We're not...

520
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
Oh my God.

521
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,640
This must be because of...

522
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Oh my God.

523
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
This is scary.

524
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
What should we do?

525
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
What's wrong?

526
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,640
I heard Professor Angkara was angry.

527
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Because the food was taken by someone.

528
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
It was eaten by someone else.

529
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
He said,

530
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,640
if anyone eats the food, they will be punished.

531
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,640
I prayed.

532
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
It's not you who ate it.

533
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Tole, it's not you, right?

534
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Yes, it's me.

535
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Be honest.

536
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Don't lie.

537
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
It's not me.

538
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Answer me.

539
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Tole.

540
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
It's not you, right?

541
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,640
It's not me.

542
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,640
I don't want you to be punished.

543
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Let's go to the classroom.

544
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Okay.

545
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Oh my God.

546
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
What should we do?

547
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
Please, Tole.

548
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,640
It's so hot in here.

549
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Water.

550
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
I'm thirsty.

551
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I need water.

552
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
I don't have a bucket.

553
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,640
I can't get water.

554
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Guard.

555
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Guard, please.

556
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm thirsty.

557
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,640
I need water.

558
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
I'm thirsty.

559
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Guard.

560
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,640
Please.

561
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm thirsty.

562
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Tole.

563
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Water.

564
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,640
It's useless to shout.

565
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,640
They will never come.

566
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Sir.

567
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
If I may know...

568
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
...why are you...

569
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,640
...able to stay in a place like this?

570
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,640
It's not hot.

571
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,640
For that...

572
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,640
...you have to master the knowledge of soul conservation.

573
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Knowledge of soul conservation?

574
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,640
What is that, sir?

575
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,640
There are two sides of life in this world.

576
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Good.

577
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Evil.

578
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Healthy.

579
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
Sick.

580
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Hot.

581
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
And cold.

582
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,640
When one of them is over...

583
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,640
...the result won't be good.

584
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Because of that...

585
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,640
...you need the balance of the soul.

586
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
A balanced soul...

587
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,640
...will release...

588
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,640
...the aura in your body.

589
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
So that...

590
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
...the heat won't be felt.

591
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,640
So, from that...

592
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,640
...you need the balance of the soul.

593
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
And you won't...

594
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,640
...feel the heat anymore.

595
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Sir.

596
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Can you...

597
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,640
...teach me the balance of the soul?

598
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,640
[The balance of the soul]

599
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Quiet!

600
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Listen, everyone.

601
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,640
I gathered you here...

602
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
...because there's a thief in this school.

603
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Thief?

604
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,640
That thief...

605
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
...has eaten my food.

606
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Because of that...

607
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,640
...I ask for the thief to confess and move forward.

608
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Yes, sir.

609
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,640
I will count to ten...

610
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,640
...and if no one confesses...

611
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,640
...then everyone will be punished.

612
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Confess, quick!

613
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
Yes, confess!

614
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,640
Confess!

615
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Who ate it?

616
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
You're always finding fault in me.

617
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
I don't know.

618
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,640
One.

619
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Two.

620
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Three.

621
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Four.

622
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,640
Confess.

623
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
This is a trivial matter.

624
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Just because of the food...

625
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,640
...I can ask you to cook a lot of food for the guests.

626
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,640
This is a school...

627
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
...that teaches discipline.

628
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Not to be a thief!

629
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Five.

630
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Confess!

631
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Six.

632
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Seven.

633
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Eight.

634
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,640
Confess!

635
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I ate it!

636
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:40,640
You ate it!

637
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Don't be weird.

638
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
You haven't eaten anything.

639
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,640
I'm sorry.

640
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
It's my fault.

641
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I'll cook now.

642
00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I'm sorry, professor.

643
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
I ate it.

644
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:22,640
To be continued...

645
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:54,640
How are you?

646
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
Are you okay?

647
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,640
I'm fine, soldier.

648
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,640
I'm a soldier.

649
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
How about you?

650
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,640
I'm just a soldier.

651
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
What about you?

652
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,640
I'm a soldier.

653
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,640
It's better if you're alone.

654
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Try me.

655
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
This is a supernatural phenomenon.

656
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Spontaneous, enchanting, romantic.

657
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Asmurat.

658
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,640
The disease lies here.

659
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,640
It's so bad.

660
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Soldier.

661
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
The cactus is so big.

662
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
It's scary.

663
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,640
This is a cactus.

664
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
I think the cactus is the one who's going to be the king.

665
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,640
If it's here, we can see it.

666
00:45:48,640 --> 00:46:02,640
I think it's not friendly.

667
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,640
Watch out. What is it throwing?

668
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Watch out.

669
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,640
It's moving.

670
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
The cactus is moving.

671
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:25,640
It's broken.

672
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
Soldier, what should we do?

673
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Our club is broken because of the cactus.

674
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,640
The cactus can talk.

675
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
It can talk.

676
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,640
The cactus has a cactus salon.

677
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
There's a lady on the table.

678
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,640
I'm sorry, cactus.

679
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
We didn't mean to.

680
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,640
Yes, we didn't mean to.

681
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,640
It's angry.

682
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,640
It's showing its tail.

683
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,640
Watch out.

684
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:18,640
I forgot that we have a fireman in our school.

685
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,640
I'm sorry, too.

686
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,640
But, Sir.

687
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
I'm sorry.

688
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:38,640
You like to eat, don't you?

689
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,640
Alright.

690
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,640
If that's the case, I'll give you a punishment that you like.

691
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,640
We'll cut the table.

692
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Please eat all of these, Alva.

693
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
Why, Alva?

694
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,640
Why did you admit that all of these are not poisoned?

695
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:46,640
If I knew that I was going to be eaten, I wouldn't have been punished.

696
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,640
But you have to listen to the rules.

697
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,640
You have to finish all of these.

698
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
No one is allowed to be left.

699
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,640
If anyone is left, you'll be punished severely.

700
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:12,640
To be continued...

701
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:33,640
Now, calm down.

702
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
Forget your worries.

703
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,640
And forget your fears, too.

704
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,640
Think about the beautiful things in your life.

705
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Now, take a deep breath.

706
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:53,640
Let out your breath.

707
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,640
Get rid of all the burdens.

708
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,640
To be continued...

709
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:13,640
How do you feel?

710
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,640
Better?

711
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,640
You're right.

712
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,640
I don't feel the heat anymore.

713
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,640
If it's like this, I think I can survive here.

714
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Thank you very much, sir.

715
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,640
They're coming soon!

716
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,640
Where are they?

717
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,640
It's already 9 o'clock. They'll be here soon.

718
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
Who are they, sir?

719
00:50:49,640 --> 00:51:09,640
To be continued...

720
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,640
Hey! Let him go! Don't hurt him!

721
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,640
I can't interfere, professor.

722
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,640
Soon, your time will come.

723
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,640
To be continued...

724
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,640
Dad! Dad! Dad!

725
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,640
Alva! Alva!

726
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,640
Oh, no.

727
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,640
It's so hot.

728
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,640
It's so bad. What should we do?

729
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,640
Alva, why did you stop?

730
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,640
If you stop and spit out all the food,

731
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,640
you'll get a worse punishment.

732
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:40,640
To be continued...

733
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Alva, I'm sure he's full.

734
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,640
Alva, we have to help Alva.

735
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,640
But, he's starting to walk.

736
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,640
To be continued...

737
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:15,640
Hey, don't go! I'll take care of him.

738
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,640
To be continued...

739
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:38,640
Alva, I'll take care of him.

740
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,640
Oh, so you want to be the leader of the lunatics, Tole.

741
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:51,640
To be continued...

742
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,640
Bro, let me go!

743
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,640
Come on.

744
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,640
Who else wants to be a hero like Tole?

745
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Then, he'll be fished.

746
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,640
And will be given to the raptor to be fed.

747
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,640
To be continued...

748
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,640
Come on, Alva.

749
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,640
Stop, Alva.

750
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,640
So, I can torture you.

751
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:40,640
To be continued...

752
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,640
Hey, who are you?

753
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,640
You, you!

754
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,640
Catch him!

755
00:54:47,640 --> 00:55:02,640
To be continued...

756
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,640
You have to hold on.

757
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,640
Come on, get up.

758
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,640
Get up.

759
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,640
Eat this.

760
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Come on, eat.

761
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,640
Chocolate.

762
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,640
Chocolate will make you happy.

763
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,640
And will protect you from the attack of the Ruputala Guard and the Fire Police.

764
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,640
The Fire Police will take your good emotions.

765
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,640
Spend all your good emotions with this chocolate.

766
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,640
You will hold on.

767
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:53,640
To be continued...

768
00:55:53,640 --> 00:56:02,640
How is it?

769
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Thank you, Sir.

770
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:13,640
To be continued...

771
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:20,640
I'm not strong anymore.

772
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
I can't.

773
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,640
I can't finish all this food.

774
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,640
So, this is the meaning of Gama and Aguliela that I ordered to come.

775
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,640
Hakara.

776
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,640
You are really too much.

777
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,640
How dare you to betray Alva.

778
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:57,640
It's okay.

779
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,640
To be continued...

780
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:12,640
What is this?

781
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,640
Why did I suddenly wake up?

782
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,640
And why am I hungry again?

783
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:34,640
Alva.

784
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
Eat all of this.

785
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,640
Alva.

786
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,640
Finish it.

787
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,640
Alva.

788
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Your body is small, but your intestines are long.

789
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,640
And your intestines are amazing. Full of smile.

790
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,640
Shut up, all of you.

791
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,640
Alva.

792
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,640
You won this time.

793
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,640
But next time, I will make you lose.

794
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,640
And I will give you a heavier punishment.

795
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,640
To be continued...

796
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,640
Buffet, pass me the rope.

797
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,640
Thank you, Sir.

798
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,640
Alva.

799
00:58:42,640 --> 00:59:00,640
To be continued...

800
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:15,640
Sir, don't.

801
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Don't touch me.

802
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,640
Sir, why are you here?

803
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
I want to see your room, Hakara.

804
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,640
Why are you still keeping my bones?

805
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,640
As a souvenir, Sir.

806
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,640
Because I have defeated Panji.

807
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,640
How far have you taught your children?

808
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,640
To teach them, Sir.

809
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,640
But I have managed to persuade all the children and teachers...

810
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,640
...to paint the classroom and classroom walls black, Sir.

811
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,640
And starting tomorrow, I will teach them black science, Sir.

812
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,640
Why do you always delay the children?

813
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,640
I need the rope as soon as possible.

814
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,640
Teach the children right now.

815
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Yes, Sir.

816
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:15,640
Damn it.

817
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,640
He's coming.

818
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,640
Hey, who are you?

819
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Who are you?

820
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,640
I'm going to kill you.

821
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:31,640
No.

822
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Where is that person?

823
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,640
Turn around.

824
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,640
I'm going to break your bones.

825
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,640
Yes, me too.

826
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,640
There he is, Boss.

827
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Chase him.

828
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,640
What's this?

829
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:26,640
My head hurts.

830
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,640
What's wrong, Boss?

831
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:47,640
No, I don't want to.

832
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,640
What? Hurry up and do it.

833
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,640
No, I don't want to. He's my friend.

834
01:01:52,640 --> 01:02:09,640
We can do it.

835
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:32,640
What are you doing?

836
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,640
I'm sorry, Sir.

837
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,640
There was a thief who broke into our school, Sir.

838
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Yes, Sir.

839
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
He broke in there.

840
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,640
We chased him inside.

841
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,640
There were three heads inside, Sir.

842
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,640
Yes, Sir.

843
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
What did he look like?

844
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,640
He wore a red shirt.

845
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,640
He had a moustache.

846
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,640
He wore a black jacket, Sir.

847
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,640
He wore a orange shirt.

848
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
He was wearing a man's shirt.

849
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
A man's shirt?

850
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
Yes, Sir.

851
01:03:07,640 --> 01:08:11,640
We're going to break his bones.

852
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,640
He's my friend.

853
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,640
Your friend?

854
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,640
Alright.

855
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,640
Then, you stay here.

856
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:27,640
Tommy!

857
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,640
Come here.

858
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,640
Be careful.

859
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,640
What did you just do?

860
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,640
And where is your intention towards Alva?

861
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:54,640
Angkara!

862
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,640
Stop!

863
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,640
I'm not going to do anything.

864
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,640
I'm going to kill you.

865
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,640
Stop!

866
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,640
Stop right here.

867
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,640
Don't force me to hurt you.

868
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,640
Sir, I don't like to be disturbed.

869
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,640
If you don't accept it,

870
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,640
it means you're letting me hurt Alva.

871
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,640
Do you want that?

872
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,640
[Tommy is being tortured.]

873
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:43,640
Tommy, do it quickly.

874
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,640
Yes, Sir.

875
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,640
Let's go, Tommy.

876
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,640
Go!

877
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,640
Run!

878
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:32,640
[Tommy is being tortured.]

879
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,640
Angkara, it's impossible.

880
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,640
Angkara, calm down.

881
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:59,640
[Tommy is being tortured.]

882
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:23,640
[To be continued...]

883
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:34,280
Never give up, chase the passion and dreams

884
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,720
Go.. go.. go, achieve all your dreams

885
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,320
Go.. go.. go, never ever stop

886
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:47,560
Go.. go.. go, fight with your heart

887
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,480
Go.. go.. go, make yourself proud

888
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,080
Go.. go.. go, let's dream

889
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:00,040
Go.. go.. go, we will be sure
