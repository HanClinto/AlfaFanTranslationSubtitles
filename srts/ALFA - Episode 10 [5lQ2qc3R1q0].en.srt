 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, prepare it, friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 To be continued...

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 To be continued...

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 To be continued...

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 We're not done, Megantar

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We still have to close the cave with a mantra

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 So that the spirit will not appear again forever

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I only had a father when I was a kid

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Now my father is gone

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm alone

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Melinta, you're not alone

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 We're still here, just us

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 You joined us to school

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Now you're free

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You're not a servant of anyone

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Free?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I'm free!

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I have to get that life fluid

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I have to lose everything so I can live again

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And remember, that life fluid is very rare

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Only one person can get that very rare life fluid

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 No one can beat Raya

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 He's so beautiful

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I'm not afraid of you

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I'm so mad

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 He's so clingy

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Just admit it, I'm going to make him lose

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I have to win, I have to

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 What's wrong, Pegah?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I don't know

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Guys, Pegah

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 You've been in the toilet for so long

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I'm sorry, I met a ghost

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 A ghost?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 That's scary

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 It's not scary anymore

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But it's annoying

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 It's annoying, and it sings

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It's on purpose, it's scaring the participants

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 So that they fail

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Oh yeah, there were a few kids who gave up

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And threw away the white flag

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And then they were returned

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 That's why we have to be careful

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And remember, we can't give up

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Let's go

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Ray, don't

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Don't

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Ray, did you hear the jury?

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We can't eat this

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 If we eat it, we'll fail

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 No way

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But I really want to

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 It looks good

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I'm hungry

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Ray, you're going to fail

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I don't think so

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Let's go

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I'm hungry

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 I have to seduce them

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So that they want to eat

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 If I do this, I'll be like a normal kid

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 This is good

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Hi, do you want some?

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Just eat it

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's really good

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But they said you can't eat it

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Who said that?

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Just eat it

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Just a little

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I won't be caught by the jury

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Come on, eat it

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Ray, don't

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Ray, don't

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Ray, don't

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Ray, don't

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Ray, don't

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Ray, don't

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I'm going to be caught

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I'm going to be caught

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I'm going to be caught

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Hi

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I'm Ray

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I'm Ray

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 The ice cream you saw is really good

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 It looks good

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Just eat it

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 If I eat it later

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm going to fail

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Who said that?

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I've tried it

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 You've run

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Really? Just eat it

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Come on, you'll regret it

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I'm going to fail

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 [The judge is very nervous]

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Just eat it

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I'm going to fail

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 What are you doing?

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 [The judges are very nervous]

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 What are you doing here?

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 You made me lose

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 So what?

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I'm sorry

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Listen, I'm a candidate for the winner

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I'm going to get the life-saving potion

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So, you're a candidate for the contestant too?

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 We're also a candidate for the winner

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 We're going to win against you

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So, are you going to win against me?

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Just give up

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Just give up

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 I'm going to win, I'm not giving up

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yes

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But it's up to you

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 If you lose, don't cry

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 What are you doing?

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 We're doing our homework

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Let's play

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 No, we don't want to play

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 We're doing our homework

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Let's play

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I'm not confident

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 You're the one who's not confident

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Come on

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I'm sorry

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I'm going to call Vega

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Let's do it

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 No

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Just do it

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Let's go

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Why are you wasting our time?

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Let's go

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Vega doesn't care about me

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 He cares about you

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I'm sorry

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I'm sorry

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I'm sorry

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I'm sorry

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I miss you, dad

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I'm alone

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 I'm lonely, dad

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I'm lonely, dad

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I'm lonely, dad

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I'm lonely, dad

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 I'm lonely, dad

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 A rat?

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 What should I do?

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I'm getting more scared

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I'm scared

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I'm scared

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I'm scared

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Don't

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Just a little

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I can't

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Just a little, don't be scared

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I'm scared

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I'm scared

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I'm scared

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I'm scared

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Alva, wake up!

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 What did I do?

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 You bit my hand

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Oh my god

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I'm sorry, Rey

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Are you okay?

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Yes, I'm okay

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 It hurts a little

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Don't be scared, Rey

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I can eat this

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 We're here to win the match

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 For Alva

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I feel sorry for Rey and Vega

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Because of me

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 They're in trouble

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Let's go

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 To save the life

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Let's go

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Rita

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Don't

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Don't touch me

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 What's wrong with you?

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Are you sick?

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Come here, I'll help you

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 No, I'm okay

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Let's go

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 There are many candies in this park

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Your task is to collect 100 candies in 30 minutes

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 In a bucket

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 The one who succeed will be sent to the next round

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 The one who fail will be eliminated and sent home

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Get ready

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Start

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Go, go, go

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Remember

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 The candies you collect

219
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Can't be eaten

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 If you eat it, you'll be sent home

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 The candies that fall from the bucket

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Will not be counted

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I got it

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Go, go, go

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Achieve all your dreams

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Go, go, go

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Never stop

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Go, go, go

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Fight with all your might

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Go, go, go

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Make your dream come true

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Go, go, go

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Let's dream

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Go, go, go

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 We can do it

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Go, go, go

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Go, go, go

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Go, go, go

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Show your spirit

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Get ready to find your friends

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Go, Raya

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Why are you so slow? I'm first

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 You're the first one

244
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Raya

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Watch out, Raya

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Go, go, go

247
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Achieve all your dreams

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Go, go, go

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Never stop

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Go, go, go

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Fight with all your might

252
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Go, go, go

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

254
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 4, 5 too

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 4, 5

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Fight with all your might

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Go, go, go

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Look at this, I got 20 candies

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 You're so slow, you're so arrogant

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Never stop

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I got it, let's go

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Let's look for more

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Go, go, go

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Fight with all your might

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Go, go, go

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Fight with all your might

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Go, go, go

268
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Fight with all your might

269
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Go, go, go

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Achieve all your dreams

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Go, go, go

272
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Raya

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Oops, sorry

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I did it on purpose

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Watch out

276
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Raya

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Miss, miss

278
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Watch out

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 You're so slow

280
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Watch out

281
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Enough

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's better to collect your candies

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 You're cheating

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 How come?

285
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Rayga

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I just remembered

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Maybe we can find the jury

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 If the candies are not there

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Does that mean

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 It's because of Raya

291
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Yay, Raya

292
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Rayga, Ray

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Calm down

294
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 There's still time

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 To exchange

296
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 What? There's no time

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 There's only 5 minutes left

298
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Where are you going?

299
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Rayga and I will be executed

300
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 No, not him

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 If we lose because of him

302
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I won't forgive him

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Where's your camera?

304
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Where's my camera?

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Where's my camera?

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Here it is

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Let me try

308
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 It's not broken

309
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 There's two

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 There's two

311
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Try again

312
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000

 We're not finished yet

 Try again

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Try again

 Let's try again

331

 You win

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000

 You win

336
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000

 Friends forever

344
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Friends forever

345
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Yes

 Friends forever

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Friends forever

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Yeah

351
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I think they're the heaviest

352
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I have to beat them

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And win their trust

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Because that's the only way I can live again

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 You lose

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 You lose

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 You win

358
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You win

359
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Hello

360
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Hello

361
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Alpha

362
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 I'm coming

363
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Hello, I'm coming

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Where are you?

365
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I'm coming

366
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I'm coming to meet my friend

367
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Why are you calling me?

368
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I'm a handsome guy

369
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 If you call me again

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I'll make you a boy

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 I'm coming

372
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Okay, where are you?

373
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I want to meet you

374
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I'm looking for medicine

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 With Vega

376
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Alpha is sick

377
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 They're looking for medicine

378
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Why are you not invited?

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I'm not invited

380
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 What is that?

381
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 A new mantra?

382
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I don't know

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 That means I don't know

384
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 That's a fairy

385
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 I'd rather talk to pretty people

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Than talk to ugly people

387
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I'm coming

388
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I'm coming

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I'm coming

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000

 I'm coming

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Hello, Pelita

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 You still remember me, right?

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I'm the handsome guy, Alpha's friend

396
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Yes, I still remember

397
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You don't want to accept my handshake?

398
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I'm sorry, I can't

399
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Why?

400
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 You're not polite

401
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Leave me alone, I want to be alone

402
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Because I'm ugly

403
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 You don't want to shake my hand?

404
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 You're arrogant

405
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 No, I'm not

406
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I'm not arrogant

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I still have self-worth as a cat

408
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I feel like I'm being stepped on by you

409
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 You have to shake my hand

410
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 No, you have to leave

411
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Leave, I'm not arrogant

412
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I'll force you

413
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 I'm sorry, I can't

414
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Popo!

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 No one can know about this

416
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 If they find out, I'll be expelled from school

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Pelita!

418
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 We can do this!

419
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000

 We can do this!

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Thank you, Popo

423
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I'm sorry, Popo

424
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I've been hiding you here

425
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 I'm sorry, I'm late

426
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I'm sorry, I'm late

427
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 It's a key

429
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 How can you do this?

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 How can you do this?

431
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 This is the key

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 No, there's another attack

433
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 We have to report this to the professor

434
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Okay

435
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 This is weird

436
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I feel like the weather is changing

437
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 A few hours ago, the temperature was 30 degrees

438
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Now it's 17 degrees

439
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Yes, you're right

440
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 How can this school be attacked again?

441
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 I don't feel any negative energy from this

442
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 I feel like it's an attack

443
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 What is this, Professor?

444
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 This is a special power

445
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 that one of the students in this school has

446
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Who is he?

447
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 He's a student of Professor Mokyam

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 He's a student of Professor Mokyam

449
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 He's a student of Professor Mokyam

450

 Who is he?

451
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 I don't know

452
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 But we have to find him

453
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 If this power is not controlled, it can be dangerous

454
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Now I'm wearing gloves

455
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 If my friends touch me

456
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I'll be in trouble

457
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Dita!

458
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Dita, come here

459
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 No, I don't want to

460
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 You're wearing gloves

461
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 But I don't want to

462
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 He's so rude

463
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 He's just like his friends, Alva, Vega, and Ray

464
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 They're both rude

465

 Don't call them Alva, Vega, and Ray

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 They're good friends

468
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 The best friends in the world?

469
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I'm the best

470
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Help!

471
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Help!

472
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Help!

473
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000

 He's a monster!

477

 What are you doing?

478
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I'm not a professor

479
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I don't know what's going on

480
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 He's lying!

 He's lying!

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I saw him with my own eyes

483
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Throw him out of the school!

484
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Or just kick him out!

485
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I'm not wrong

486
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Don't kick me out of the school

487
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000

488
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 He's a monster!

 Don't be close to him!

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Don't kick him out of the school!

 Maybe Tommy was right

493
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I can't be here

494
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Because I can hurt people who are innocent

495
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000

496
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Nurita!

 Now you have to walk through that bridge

501
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 You have to use your own power

502
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 No magic

503
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000

 Don't forget, you have to be careful

 Wait, friends. Do you know how to use it?

 Why can't you come back to this world?

628

 All of this is because of Ullah Aldebaran.

 He always blocks me.

 If so, I have to surrender.

 But sir, your strength hasn't recovered yet.

 You won't be able to fight Aldebaran.

 I wish you all the best.

 Because you have passed the first gate,

647
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,400
 which is the gate of dreams.

648
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,400
 This second gate is called the gate of patience.

 As the name implies,

650
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
 in this gate you will be tested for your patience.

 In this gate, you can't be angry,

 can't be selfish,

 But, are you afraid of me?

768
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,400
 I have a strange power.

769
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
 I can make everyone freeze.

770
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
 Now the school is frozen.

771
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,400
 But who did it, Professor?

772
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
 The one who did it is Prita.

773
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,400
 Prita?

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:41,400
