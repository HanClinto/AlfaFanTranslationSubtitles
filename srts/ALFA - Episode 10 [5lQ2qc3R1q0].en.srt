1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, prepare it, friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're not done, Megantar

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We still have to close the cave with a mantra

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So that the spirit will not appear again forever

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I only had a father when I was a kid

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now my father is gone

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm alone

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Melinta, you're not alone

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're still here, just us

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You joined us to school

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now you're free

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're not a servant of anyone

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Free?

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm free!

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have to get that life fluid

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have to lose everything so I can live again

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And remember, that life fluid is very rare

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Only one person can get that very rare life fluid

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No one can beat Raya

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's so beautiful

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not afraid of you

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm so mad

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He's so clingy

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Just admit it, I'm going to make him lose

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have to win, I have to

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's wrong, Pegah?

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Guys, Pegah

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You've been in the toilet for so long

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry, I met a ghost

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A ghost?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's scary

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not scary anymore

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But it's annoying

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's annoying, and it sings

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's on purpose, it's scaring the participants

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So that they fail

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh yeah, there were a few kids who gave up

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And threw away the white flag

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then they were returned

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's why we have to be careful

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And remember, we can't give up

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ray, don't

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ray, did you hear the jury?

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We can't eat this

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If we eat it, we'll fail

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No way

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I really want to

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It looks good

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm hungry

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ray, you're going to fail

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't think so

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm hungry

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have to seduce them

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that they want to eat

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If I do this, I'll be like a normal kid

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is good

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hi, do you want some?

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just eat it

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's really good

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But they said you can't eat it

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who said that?

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Just eat it

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Just a little

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I won't be caught by the jury

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come on, eat it

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ray, don't

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to be caught

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hi

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm Ray

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The ice cream you saw is really good

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It looks good

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Just eat it

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If I eat it later

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm going to fail

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who said that?

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've tried it

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You've run

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Really? Just eat it

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come on, you'll regret it

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm going to fail

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
[The judge is very nervous]

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:49,000
[The judges are very nervous]

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Just eat it

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going to fail

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you doing?

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
[The judges are very nervous]

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You made me lose

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So what?

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Listen, I'm a candidate for the winner

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm going to get the life-saving potion

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, you're a candidate for the contestant too?

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We're also a candidate for the winner

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We're going to win against you

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, are you going to win against me?

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just give up

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to win, I'm not giving up

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But it's up to you

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you lose, don't cry

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're doing our homework

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's play

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, we don't want to play

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We're doing our homework

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's play

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm not confident

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're the one who's not confident

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Come on

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm going to call Vega

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's do it

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Just do it

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why are you wasting our time?

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Let's go

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Vega doesn't care about me

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He cares about you

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I miss you, dad

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm alone

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm lonely, dad

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A rat?

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What should I do?

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm getting more scared

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm scared

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Just a little

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can't

145
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Just a little, don't be scared

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm scared

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Alfa, wake up!

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What did I do?

149
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You bit my hand

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh my god

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry, Rey

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Are you okay?

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, I'm okay

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It hurts a little

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't be scared, Rey

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can eat this

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We're here to win the match

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For Alfa

159
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I feel sorry for Rey and Vega

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because of me

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They're in trouble

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's go

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To save the life

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Rita

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't

167
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't touch me

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What's wrong with you?

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Are you sick?

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Come here, I'll help you

171
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, I'm okay

172
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's go

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There are many candies in this park

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Your task is to collect 100 candies in 30 minutes

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In a bucket

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The one who succeed will be sent to the next round

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The one who fail will be eliminated and sent home

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Get ready

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Start

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Go, go, go

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Remember

182
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The candies you collect

183
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can't be eaten

184
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you eat it, you'll be sent home

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The candies that fall from the bucket

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Will not be counted

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I got it

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Go, go, go

189
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Achieve all your dreams

190
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Go, go, go

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Never stop

192
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Go, go, go

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Fight with all your might

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Go, go, go

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Make your dream come true

196
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Go, go, go

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Let's dream

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Go, go, go

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We can do it

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Go, go, go

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Show your spirit

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Get ready to find your friends

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Go, Raya

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why are you so slow? I'm first

205
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're the first one

206
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Raya

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Watch out, Raya

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Go, go, go

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Achieve all your dreams

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Go, go, go

211
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Never stop

212
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Go, go, go

213
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Fight with all your might

214
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Go, go, go

215
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

216
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
4, 5 too

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
4, 5

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Fight with all your might

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Go, go, go

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Look at this, I got 20 candies

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're so slow, you're so arrogant

222
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Never stop

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I got it, let's go

224
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's look for more

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Go, go, go

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Fight with all your might

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Go, go, go

228
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Fight with all your might

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Go, go, go

230
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Fight with all your might

231
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Go, go, go

232
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Achieve all your dreams

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Go, go, go

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Raya

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oops, sorry

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I did it on purpose

237
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Watch out

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Raya

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Miss, miss

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Watch out

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're so slow

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Watch out

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Enough

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's better to collect your candies

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're cheating

246
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How come?

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Rayga

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I just remembered

249
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Maybe we can find the jury

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If the candies are not there

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Does that mean

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's because of Raya

253
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yay, Raya

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Rayga, Ray

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Calm down

256
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There's still time

257
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
To exchange

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What? There's no time

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's only 5 minutes left

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where are you going?

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Rayga and I will be executed

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, not him

263
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If we lose because of him

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I won't forgive him

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Where's your camera?

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Where's my camera?

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Here it is

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Let me try

269
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's not broken

270
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's two

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Try again

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Here

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We're not finished yet

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's try again

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We're not finished yet

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's try again

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Try again

278
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's try again

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Try again

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's try again

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You win

282
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes

283
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You win

284
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes

285
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You win

286
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes

287
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You win

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes

289
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You win

290
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Friends forever

292
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes

293
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Friends forever

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah

295
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think they're the heaviest

296
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I have to beat them

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And win their trust

298
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Because that's the only way I can live again

299
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You lose

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You win

301
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hello

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Alpha

303
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm coming

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hello, I'm coming

305
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Where are you?

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm coming

307
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm coming to meet my friend

308
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why are you calling me?

309
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm a handsome guy

310
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If you call me again

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll make you a boy

312
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm coming

313
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay, where are you?

314
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I want to meet you

315
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm looking for medicine

316
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
With Vega

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Alpha is sick

318
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They're looking for medicine

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why are you not invited?

320
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not invited

321
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What is that?

322
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
A new mantra?

323
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't know

324
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That means I don't know

325
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's a fairy

326
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'd rather talk to pretty people

327
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Than talk to ugly people

328
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm coming

329
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hello, Pelita

330
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You still remember me, right?

331
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm the handsome guy, Alpha's friend

332
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes, I still remember

333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You don't want to accept my handshake?

334
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry, I can't

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why?

336
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You're not polite

337
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Leave me alone, I want to be alone

338
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Because I'm ugly

339
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You don't want to shake my hand?

340
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're arrogant

341
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
No, I'm not

342
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm not arrogant

343
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I still have self-worth as a cat

344
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I feel like I'm being stepped on by you

345
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You have to shake my hand

346
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, you have to leave

347
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Leave, I'm not arrogant

348
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll force you

349
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry, I can't

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Popo!

351
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No one can know about this

352
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If they find out, I'll be expelled from school

353
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Pelita!

354
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We can do this!

355
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank you, Popo

356
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm sorry, Popo

357
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I've been hiding you here

358
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm sorry, I'm late

359
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What's that?

360
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's a key

361
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
How can you do this?

362
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This is the key

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
No, there's another attack

364
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We have to report this to the professor

365
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Okay

366
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is weird

367
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I feel like the weather is changing

368
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A few hours ago, the temperature was 30 degrees

369
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Now it's 17 degrees

370
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes, you're right

371
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How can this school be attacked again?

372
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't feel any negative energy from this

373
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I feel like it's an attack

374
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What is this, Professor?

375
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is a special power

376
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that one of the students in this school has

377
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Who is he?

378
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,000
He's a student of Professor Mokyam

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Who is he?

380
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know

381
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But we have to find him

382
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If this power is not controlled, it can be dangerous

383
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Now I'm wearing gloves

384
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If my friends touch me

385
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll be in trouble

386
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Dita!

387
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Dita, come here

388
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
No, I don't want to

389
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You're wearing gloves

390
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But I don't want to

391
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He's so rude

392
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
He's just like his friends, Alfa, Vega, and Ray

393
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
They're both rude

394
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Don't call them Alfa, Vega, and Ray

395
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
They're good friends

396
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Really?

397
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The best friends in the world?

398
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm the best

399
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Help!

400
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What's going on?

401
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
He's a monster!

402
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What are you doing?

403
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm not a professor

404
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't know what's going on

405
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
He's lying!

406
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I saw him with my own eyes

407
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Throw him out of the school!

408
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Or just kick him out!

409
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm not wrong

410
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Don't kick me out of the school

411
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because I don't have anyone else

412
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He's a monster!

413
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Don't be close to him!

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't kick him out of the school!

415
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Throw him out!

416
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Maybe Tommy was right

417
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I can't be here

418
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Because I can hurt people who are innocent

419
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Like Popo

420
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Nurita!

421
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I didn't mean to

422
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Nurita!

423
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Now you have to walk through that bridge

424
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You have to use your own power

425
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No magic

426
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No flying

427
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No magic

428
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't forget, you have to be careful

429
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because if you fall, you can be carried by the smoke

430
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm sorry

431
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,400
If I can fly, I will be number one.

432
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,400
But I can't. I can't let other kids fall.

433
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,400
But, the camera is for photography.

434
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Then, what is this cover for?

435
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Let's try it.

436
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
I have to win. I can't lose.

437
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
That's the sound of the wind.

438
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Apparently, this thing can hear people's heart.

439
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Later, when it passes, I will send Go Vega, Ava, and Ray.

440
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Let them fall and then bring smoke.

441
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Just watch. I will make them lose.

442
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Wait, friends. Do you know how to use it?

443
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,400
I know. It can hear people's heart.

444
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I heard Raya was trying to attack us.

445
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Are you serious?

446
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,400
We have to be careful. Raya is behind us.

447
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Okay.

448
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,400
[Scream]

449
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,400
I can't fall. If I fall, I will fail.

450
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,400
What should I do? I can't fly. If I fly, I will fail.

451
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Friends, let's just leave him.

452
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Let's just throw him.

453
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
But, poor Vega. What if he really falls?

454
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Poor him. He's already a ghost.

455
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,400
He's gone, Alfa. It's useless to help him.

456
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Yes, if he falls, he won't die again.

457
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,400
But we can't just stay still. We have to help him.

458
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Let's go.

459
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
No, Vega. We have to help him.

460
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Wait here. I won't be long.

461
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Alfa. / Raya.

462
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Come on, Raya. Hold my hand.

463
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,400
You are my brother.

464
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Yes, we are rivals.

465
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
That's fair.

466
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Come on, hold my hand.

467
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Thank you, Alfa. If you don't help me, I will fail.

468
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
You're welcome, Raya.

469
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Alfa, what's wrong?

470
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Alfa.

471
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
It's because of you, Raya.

472
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Alfa.

473
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
What should we do?

474
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,400
In the next five minutes, you have to arrive at the next destination.

475
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,400
The one who arrives late will be sent back to the flight attendant.

476
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
What should we do?

477
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Oh my God.

478
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,400
So, this is what the girl named Pelita did?

479
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,400
I've heard a power that changes everything into ice.

480
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Freezing.

481
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Even a small child can't handle it.

482
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
And make this school freeze.

483
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Ice.

484
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,400
And she can freeze herself.

485
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
I can speed up. Dangerous.

486
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
You three can continue to the next flight.

487
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Yes.

488
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Thank you, Ray, for helping me.

489
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Now we're in the first flight.

490
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
And there's one more flight left that we have to pass.

491
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
I want to tell Pelita that we're on a adventure today.

492
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Here.

493
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Eh, the light is on.

494
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Maybe Pelita is calling me again.

495
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
What happened?

496
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Pelita.

497
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Pelita, are you calling me?

498
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Answer me, Pelita.

499
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Answer me.

500
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:58,400
[Crying]

501
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:15,400
My friend.

502
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
My friend, let's go.

503
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Why are you wasting time with him?

504
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
If my brother saw my hand like this,

505
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,400
he would be afraid to be friends with me.

506
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
We can't give up.

507
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Ray has already fallen.

508
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
So we have to hold on.

509
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
All of this is because of one thing.

510
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,400
My strength is normal.

511
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Sir.

512
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Sir, help me.

513
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:38,400
[Screaming]

514
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Where did you come from, Angkara?

515
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Why can't you come back to this world?

516
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,400
All of this is because of Ullah Aldebaran.

517
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
He always blocks me.

518
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,400
And all my plans failed because of him, sir.

519
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,400
If so, I have to surrender.

520
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
But sir, your strength hasn't recovered yet.

521
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
You won't be able to fight Aldebaran.

522
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,400
But now I have a great weapon that can defeat Aldebaran.

523
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,400
And I will get my chosen child.

524
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,400
[Laughter]

525
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Nede, why can't you answer?

526
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Maybe he's playing with his friends.

527
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
It's possible.

528
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Okay, I'll tell him later.

529
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
It's better if we continue our journey.

530
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Okay, let's go.

531
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Welcome back, children.

532
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
I wish you all the best.

533
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Because you have passed the first gate,

534
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,400
which is the gate of dreams.

535
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,400
This second gate is called the gate of patience.

536
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
As the name implies,

537
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
in this gate you will be tested for your patience.

538
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
In this gate, you can't be angry,

539
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
can't be selfish,

540
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,400
and can't force your own will.

541
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Do you understand?

542
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,400
That's right, this is the canteen.

543
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Now you can eat first.

544
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Yes, yes, I didn't think we could eat.

545
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes, yes, yes.

546
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Surely the food is better than the first room.

547
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
That's right.

548
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Yes, there must be a grill.

549
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
Where is the food?

550
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Wow.

551
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Congratulations.

552
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
This must be delicious food.

553
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Food.

554
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Let's open it.

555
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
One, two, three.

556
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Ta-da.

557
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Wow, the food is like this.

558
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
The food is like this.

559
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
It's really delicious.

560
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Vegetables.

561
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Because I don't like vegetables.

562
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I want to eat.

563
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Me too.

564
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I really want to eat vegetables.

565
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I'm not a goat, I eat vegetables.

566
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Rih.

567
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
As I said earlier.

568
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
This place is to test and practice patience.

569
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,400
You have to finish the vegetables and you can't be angry.

570
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,400
If you are angry or give up, you will return to the first flight.

571
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,400
And if you finish eating, you are considered to have fallen and returned to the first flight.

572
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Oh my God.

573
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
We can't give up.

574
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Rih has already fallen.

575
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
So we have to hold on.

576
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Yes, we have to be patient.

577
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Even though I don't like tomatoes, but I have to hold on.

578
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
I have to eat this tomato.

579
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,400
As long as I have the nature of a snake in my body, I want to eat meat.

580
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Especially this.

581
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
We have to be patient, Fah.

582
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,400
You have to control your emotions.

583
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Because we have to go through all this.

584
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Yes, Vega.

585
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
There is no other way.

586
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Only the fire of the firefly can warm this room.

587
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I emphasize once again.

588
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,400
If the power owned by this snake is very dangerous.

589
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,400
It can endanger the magic school and students.

590
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,400
And the temperature in the room is already below 20 degrees, Professor.

591
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
This is dangerous.

592
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Let's check the children.

593
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,400
You concentrate and read body warming mantras.

594
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,400
So that your condition remains stable.

595
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Oh my God.

596
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,400
They must be cold and faint.

597
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
It's better to lift them up with a pole.

598
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
It's broken.

599
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Why is the magic useless?

600
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Magic can't work.

601
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Because the air here is too cold.

602
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Now, how can we save them?

603
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
We lift them one by one.

604
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,400
It's bad, Professor.

605
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Jack and Hit are weakening.

606
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,400
Mike too.

607
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
This child too, Professor.

608
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
We have to hurry.

609
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,400
If we are late, these children can die.

610
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Wow.

611
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Ray, you're out too?

612
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Yes.

613
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
I don't want to eat vegetables.

614
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Don't want to eat vegetables?

615
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Vegetables are good for your health.

616
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Is it because of your vegetables?

617
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
It's not good.

618
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Ray.

619
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,400
How about Alfa?

620
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Alfa has been in a coma twice.

621
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
It's still that long?

622
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
It's better if you're exciting, Dep.

623
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
I'm sure I win.

624
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,400
This is called winning in a battle.

625
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
I'm excited.

626
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,400
What if we become friends?

627
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,400
But, are you afraid of me?

628
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,400
I have a strange power.

629
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
I can make everyone freeze.

630
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Now the school is frozen.

631
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,400
But who did it, Professor?

632
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
The one who did it is Prita.

633
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,400
Prita?
