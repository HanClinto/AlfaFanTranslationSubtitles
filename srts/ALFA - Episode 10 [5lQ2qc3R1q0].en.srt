1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, prepare it, friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:29,000
To be continued...

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're not done, Megantar

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We still have to close the cave with a mantra

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So that the spirit will not appear again forever

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I only had a father when I was a kid

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now my father is gone

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm alone

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Melinta, you're not alone

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're still here, just us

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You joined us to school

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now you're free

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're not a servant of anyone

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Free?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm free!

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have to get that life fluid

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have to lose everything so I can live again

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And remember, that life fluid is very rare

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Only one person can get that very rare life fluid

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No one can beat Raya

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's so beautiful

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not afraid of you

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm so mad

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He's so clingy

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Just admit it, I'm going to make him lose

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have to win, I have to

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's wrong, Pegah?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Guys, Pegah

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You've been in the toilet for so long

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry, I met a ghost

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A ghost?

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's scary

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not scary anymore

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But it's annoying

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's annoying, and it sings

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's on purpose, it's scaring the participants

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So that they fail

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh yeah, there were a few kids who gave up

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And threw away the white flag

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then they were returned

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's why we have to be careful

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And remember, we can't give up

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ray, don't

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ray, did you hear the jury?

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We can't eat this

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If we eat it, we'll fail

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No way

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I really want to

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It looks good

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm hungry

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ray, you're going to fail

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't think so

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm hungry

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have to seduce them

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that they want to eat

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If I do this, I'll be like a normal kid

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is good

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hi, do you want some?

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just eat it

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's really good

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But they said you can't eat it

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who said that?

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Just eat it

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Just a little

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I won't be caught by the jury

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come on, eat it

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ray, don't

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to be caught

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hi

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm Ray

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The ice cream you saw is really good

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It looks good

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Just eat it

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If I eat it later

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm going to fail

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who said that?

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've tried it

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You've run

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Really? Just eat it

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come on, you'll regret it

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm going to fail

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
[The judge is very nervous]

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:49,000
[The judges are very nervous]

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Just eat it

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going to fail

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you doing?

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
[The judges are very nervous]

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What are you doing here?

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You made me lose

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So what?

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Listen, I'm a candidate for the winner

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm going to get the life-saving potion

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, you're a candidate for the contestant too?

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We're also a candidate for the winner

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We're going to win against you

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, are you going to win against me?

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just give up

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to win, I'm not giving up

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But it's up to you

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you lose, don't cry

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're doing our homework

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's play

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, we don't want to play

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We're doing our homework

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's play

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm not confident

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're the one who's not confident

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Come on

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm going to call Vega

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's do it

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Just do it

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why are you wasting our time?

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Let's go

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Vega doesn't care about me

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He cares about you

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I miss you, dad

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm alone

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm lonely, dad

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A rat?

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What should I do?

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm getting more scared

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm scared

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Just a little

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can't

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Just a little, don't be scared

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm scared

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Alfa, wake up!

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What did I do?

151
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You bit my hand

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh my god

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry, Rey

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Are you okay?

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, I'm okay

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It hurts a little

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't be scared, Rey

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can eat this

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We're here to win the match

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For Alfa

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I feel sorry for Rey and Vega

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because of me

163
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They're in trouble

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's go

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To save the life

166
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Rita

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't touch me

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What's wrong with you?

171
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Are you sick?

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Come here, I'll help you

173
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, I'm okay

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's go

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There are many candies in this park

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Your task is to collect 100 candies in 30 minutes

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In a bucket

178
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The one who succeed will be sent to the next round

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The one who fail will be eliminated and sent home

180
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Get ready

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Start

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Go, go, go

183
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Remember

184
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The candies you collect

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can't be eaten

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you eat it, you'll be sent home

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The candies that fall from the bucket

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Will not be counted

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I got it

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Go, go, go

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Achieve all your dreams

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Go, go, go

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Never stop

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Go, go, go

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Fight with all your might

196
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Go, go, go

197
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Make your dream come true

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Go, go, go

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Let's dream

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Go, go, go

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We can do it

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Go, go, go

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Show your spirit

204
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Get ready to find your friends

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Go, Raya

206
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why are you so slow? I'm first

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're the first one

208
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Raya

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Watch out, Raya

210
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Go, go, go

211
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Achieve all your dreams

212
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Go, go, go

213
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Never stop

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Go, go, go

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Fight with all your might

216
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Go, go, go

217
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

218
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
4, 5 too

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
4, 5

220
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Fight with all your might

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Go, go, go

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Look at this, I got 20 candies

223
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're so slow, you're so arrogant

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Never stop

225
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I got it, let's go

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's look for more

227
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Go, go, go

228
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Fight with all your might

229
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Go, go, go

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Fight with all your might

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Go, go, go

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Fight with all your might

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Go, go, go

234
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Achieve all your dreams

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Go, go, go

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Raya

237
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oops, sorry

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I did it on purpose

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Watch out

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Raya

241
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Miss, miss

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Watch out

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're so slow

244
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Watch out

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Enough

246
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's better to collect your candies

247
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're cheating

248
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How come?

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Rayga

250
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I just remembered

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Maybe we can find the jury

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If the candies are not there

253
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Does that mean

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's because of Raya

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yay, Raya

256
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Rayga, Ray

257
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Calm down

258
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There's still time

259
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
To exchange

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What? There's no time

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's only 5 minutes left

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where are you going?

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Rayga and I will be executed

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, not him

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If we lose because of him

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I won't forgive him

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Where's your camera?

268
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Where's my camera?

269
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Here it is

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Let me try

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's not broken

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's two

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Try again

274
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Here

275
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We're not finished yet

276
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's try again

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We're not finished yet

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's try again

279
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Try again

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's try again

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Try again

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's try again

283
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You win

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You win

286
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes

287
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You win

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes

289
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You win

290
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes

291
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You win

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes

293
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Friends forever

294
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Friends forever

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah

297
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I think they're the heaviest

298
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I have to beat them

299
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And win their trust

300
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Because that's the only way I can live again

301
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You lose

302
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You win

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hello

304
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Alpha

305
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm coming

306
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hello, I'm coming

307
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Where are you?

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm coming

309
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm coming to meet my friend

310
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why are you calling me?

311
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm a handsome guy

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If you call me again

313
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll make you a boy

314
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm coming

315
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay, where are you?

316
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I want to meet you

317
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm looking for medicine

318
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
With Vega

319
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Alpha is sick

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They're looking for medicine

321
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why are you not invited?

322
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not invited

323
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What is that?

324
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
A new mantra?

325
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't know

326
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That means I don't know

327
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's a fairy

328
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'd rather talk to pretty people

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Than talk to ugly people

330
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm coming

331
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hello, Pelita

332
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You still remember me, right?

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm the handsome guy, Alpha's friend

334
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes, I still remember

335
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You don't want to accept my handshake?

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry, I can't

337
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why?

338
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You're not polite

339
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Leave me alone, I want to be alone

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Because I'm ugly

341
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You don't want to shake my hand?

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're arrogant

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
No, I'm not

344
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm not arrogant

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I still have self-worth as a cat

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I feel like I'm being stepped on by you

347
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You have to shake my hand

348
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, you have to leave

349
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Leave, I'm not arrogant

350
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll force you

351
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry, I can't

352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Popo!

353
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No one can know about this

354
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If they find out, I'll be expelled from school

355
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Pelita!

356
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We can do this!

357
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank you, Popo

358
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm sorry, Popo

359
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I've been hiding you here

360
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm sorry, I'm late

361
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What's that?

362
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's a key

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
How can you do this?

364
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This is the key

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
No, there's another attack

366
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We have to report this to the professor

367
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Okay

368
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is weird

369
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I feel like the weather is changing

370
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A few hours ago, the temperature was 30 degrees

371
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Now it's 17 degrees

372
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes, you're right

373
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How can this school be attacked again?

374
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't feel any negative energy from this

375
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I feel like it's an attack

376
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What is this, Professor?

377
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is a special power

378
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that one of the students in this school has

379
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Who is he?

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,000
He's a student of Professor Mokyam

381
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Who is he?

382
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know

383
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But we have to find him

384
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If this power is not controlled, it can be dangerous

385
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Now I'm wearing gloves

386
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If my friends touch me

387
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000

No, I don't want to

They're both rude

Don't call them Alfa, Vega, and Ray

They're good friends

399
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000

He's a monster!

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm not a professor

I saw him with my own eyes

409
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Throw him out of the school!

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000

Don't be close to him!

I can't be here

420
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Because I can hurt people who are innocent

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000

575
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Wow.

576
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Congratulations.

577
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
This must be delicious food.

578
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Food.

579
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Let's open it.

580
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
One, two, three.

581
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Ta-da.

Wow, the food is like this.

584
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
The food is like this.

585
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
It's really delicious.

586
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Vegetables.

587
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Because I don't like vegetables.

588
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I want to eat.

589
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Me too.

590
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I really want to eat vegetables.

591
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
I'm not a goat, I eat vegetables.

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
As I said earlier.

602
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
This place is to test and practice patience.

603
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,400
You have to finish the vegetables and you can't be angry.

604
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,400
If you are angry or give up, you will return to the first flight.

605
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,400
And if you finish eating, you are considered to have fallen and returned to the first flight.

We can't give up.

609
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Rih has already fallen.

610
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
So we have to hold on.

611
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Yes, we have to be patient.

613
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Even though I don't like tomatoes, but I have to hold on.

614
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
I have to eat this tomato.

615
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,400
As long as I have the nature of a snake in my body, I want to eat meat.

616
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Especially this.

617
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
We have to be patient, Fah.

618
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,400
You have to control your emotions.

619
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Because we have to go through all this.

620
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Yes, Vega.

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
There is no other way.

623
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Only the fire of the firefly can warm this room.

625
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I emphasize once again.

626
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,400
If the power owned by this snake is very dangerous.

627
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,400
It can endanger the magic school and students.

628
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,400
And the temperature in the room is already below 20 degrees, Professor.

629
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
This is dangerous.

630
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Let's check the children.

You concentrate and read body warming mantras.

633
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,400
So that your condition remains stable.

Oh my God.

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,400
They must be cold and faint.

637
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
It's better to lift them up with a pole.

Magic can't work.

643
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Because the air here is too cold.

644
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Now, how can we save them?

645
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
We lift them one by one.

I don't want to eat vegetables.

Don't want to eat vegetables?

00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Vegetables are good for your health.

661
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Is it because of your vegetables?

00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
It's not good.

It's better if you're exciting, Dep.

I'm sure I win.

I have a strange power.
