1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To be continued...

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh my God, this wound is very bad

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And must be treated immediately with energy transfer

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The sword of the savior

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sword of the savior?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Defatambarga

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Destroy them all, Bar

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't let them enter the castle

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let me go

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to remember Alfa

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Vega, Ray, Soleh, have you got the sword?

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not yet, bro, now Alfa is the one who is wrong to be the sword

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alfa?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They will definitely meet

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If the dark lord will catch and finish Alfa

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will finish them all

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The head of the headless school, Aldubaran

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But don't worry for me

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will infuse Aldubaran, I will help you

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just that, what I will infuse is not the dragon to Alubaran

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But poison

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Poison, poison, where is the poison?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I need help

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where is the poison?

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I need help

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Alfa, wake up Alfa

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Alfa, wake up

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are the one who has been missing for two years

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why do you come to my dream?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alfa, do you know who that kid is?

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who?

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That kid is you

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Alfa, you are the one who has been missing for two years

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You and my father, right?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If they are my father's servants

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If I am not taken care of

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then where are they now?

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Of course they don't take care of you

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because they are old

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They are not your children

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Even if they don't take care of you

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because they are both dead

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Dead?

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why is the rain so heavy?

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ketomi, please, sir

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Professor Ankara is attacking Professor Alubaran

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What?

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Kau Vega, Kare, and Katole are fighting him

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I don't know if they are strong enough or not

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have to do something

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Jack, wait for the kids

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We have to save Professor Alubaran

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, sir

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you, Ketomi

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Guys!

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We have to help Professor Alubaran

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He is fighting Professor Ankara

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Boss!

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Have you got it?

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I have

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's find the other eggs

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's wrong?

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a monster!

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Run!

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's wrong?

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a monster!

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Run!

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ankara!

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Kids!

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Stop them!

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Kids!

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Stop them!

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Say it!

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Feel it!

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Dad!

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are you here?

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We want to help you

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Guys, let's get ready

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey!

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you think you can defeat me?

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You underestimated me

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Even though you have 1.000

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You still can't defeat me

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Professor Ankara, don't be too cocky

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, we are special

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you want to know why they died?

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Guys!

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't hurt them

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let them go

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Guys!

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's go

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go

Let's go

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Guys!

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's go

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Guys!

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's go

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Guys!

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Guys!

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Guys!

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's go

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Guys!

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's go

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Guys!

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's go

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Guys!

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's go

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Guys!

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Guys!

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's go

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Guys!

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's go

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Guys!

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's go

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Guys!

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Guys!

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's go

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Guys!

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's go

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:10:57,000
To be continued...

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A drop of water from a chosen child

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Can bring back my power

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mr. Bonda!

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me go!

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mr. Hipok, the teeth can kill

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But you can kill it through the teeth

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The string is his weakness

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What did I teach you?

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You've killed your monster

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now listen to me

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Boku!

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Kids, you're all great

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Going to Egypt to buy turtles

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The magic children are really great

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah!

165
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
To be continued...

166
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Only your blood status left

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then my power is perfect

168
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Because your blood status

169
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Can bring back my power

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I don't give up

171
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't give up

172
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My blood is for a monster like you

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I fight to the death

174
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So you can't

175
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Take my blood anymore

176
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Who do you think you are?

177
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you know who you're facing?

178
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm the Dark Lord

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Your power

180
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can't beat mine

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I don't need your permission

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will take your blood

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For real

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Take his blood!

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Watch out!

186
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No!

187
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Watch out!

188
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Soon, the power that you've been hiding

189
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Will be back

190
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And it's all because of you, Alfa

191
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please go home, Alfa

192
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because your job is done

193
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I won't let the Dark Lord

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Come back!

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You've made me so angry, Alfa

196
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Feel this

00:16:37,000 --> 00:17:09,000
(Music)

198
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you know what this means?

199
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That is the torture mantra

200
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
(Laugh)

201
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
After you enter this room

202
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You will feel our torture

203
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Very amazing

204
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And you will ask your parents

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
(Laugh)

206
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Dad, Mom

207
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What is this time I met you?

208
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
(Laugh)

209
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,760

210
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:58,300

211
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,480
Alpha

212
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,120
Bro

213
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Mom

214
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,440
Now

215
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,200
I know who you are

216
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
Dad

217
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,780
Mom

218
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,220
I've been fighting

219
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,360
But I lost

220
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,340
Like this

221
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,480
I will meet you both

222
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,960
No, Ango

223
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,600
You can't give up

224
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,640
Yes, Ang. There will be a time when we meet again.

225
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,640
You must defeat the darkness.

226
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,140
You are our only hope.

227
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,820
How?

228
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,860
He's so strong. He has the power of a star.

229
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,620
Only with the determination and love that's in you can you defeat all evil, Alpha.

230
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,040
You must believe in yourself. You can do it.

231
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
(Epic music)

232
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,100
Okay

233
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,360
I won't give up.

234
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,180
Be patient, Alpha. There will be a time when we meet again.

235
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
(Epic music)

236
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:43,100
I can't give up. If the darkness gets my blood, it will get stronger. It will hurt a lot of people.

237
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,100
I must resist. For Sega, for Ray, for the stars, and for Tenara.

238
00:19:50,100 --> 00:20:01,320
Megazord

239
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:09,580
Red Bird, help me.

240
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:20,840
(Scream)

241
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:37,340
We can do it

242
00:20:37,340 --> 00:21:01,060
[Beep]

244
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,860
why weird, why can he suddenly disappear?

245
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,400
even though he followed

246
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,260
so our effort is in vain

247
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,760
hey

248
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
don't say in vain

249
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,760
there is a white chicken climbing a tree

250
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,260
don't be sad

251
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,160
because you have defeated Ankara

252
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,960
right, Ankara has escaped

253
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,660
you all managed to save professor Aldebaran

254

[music]

255
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
now

256
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,560
it's better for you to find and save Alfa

257
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,960
Vega

258
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160

260
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,960
you save Alfa

261
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
you go, save Alfa

262
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,460
and you can also bring the head of the dragon

263
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
yes, sir

264
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:28,260

265
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,760
wow, this is a big dragon

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
wow, it's so big

267
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Vega

268
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
next time

269
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
we will go to the forest

270
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm not afraid

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,760

281
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
What happened to me?

282
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Why am I here?

283
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,640
I thought I was swimming in the nature?

284
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm confused!

285
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Thank you, Garuda bird!

286
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm gone!

287
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:33,640
I have to find the sword

288
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
and go back to school.

289
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Why did you come here, Alfa?

290
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Are you looking for the sword?

291
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Yes.

292
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,640
The sword is not here.

293
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
It's my plan to trap you.

294
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,640
But...

295
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Doctor Pertiwi said that...

296
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Doctor Pertiwi?

297
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,640
He's been affected by hypnotism.

298
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
He will talk to you as I want.

299
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
You're a bad person!

300
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Enough, Alfa!

301
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
It's better...

302
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
if you join me...

303
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
than you die in vain.

304
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
You can be my guardian.

305
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,640
And we will rule this world!

306
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,640
No, I don't want to work with you!

307
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
You're a bad person!

308
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
You're a murderer!

309
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
You're so rude, Alfa!

310
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
How dare you to come to the dark side!

311
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,640
I'm focused!

312
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Ankara...

313
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,640
failed to get your blood.

314
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,640
But not with the help of darkness.

315
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640

316
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:22,640
It hurts!

317
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm Alfa.

318
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
You're Bil.

319
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
You want to be my guardian?

320
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
No!

321
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
I won't give up!

322
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,640
It hurts!

323
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Help!

324
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I think I hear Alfa's voice.

325
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Alfa, please show yourself to me.

326
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Alfa?

327
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Enough, Alfa!

328
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
It's useless to fight!

329
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
You're sick!

330
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Bite him!

331
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Let him go!

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Why are you here?

335
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
You want to give me your heart?

336
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Right?

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,640
Open your eyes, Alfa.

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm talking through your heart.

340
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Because only you can hear it.

341
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Come on, open your eyes.

Do you know what the task of a star is?

344
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,640
The task of a star is to increase my power!

345
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Wrong.

346
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
The task of a star is...

The darkness wants to sweat, tears, and my blood.

We can do it!

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,640
It's Alfa!

Yes, just take it as my reward.

Because you helped me to go back to the sky.

How are the kids?

Dr. Pertiwi is not lying.

395
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,640
He was just hypnotized by Professor Angkara.

396
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:43,640
It's true, guys.

397
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,640
It's true.

It's scary.

402
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Now, Pertiwi, how do we save Professor Aldebaran?

403
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
This kind of energy transmission is the best.

404
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Now, Professor Aldebaran can rest in the clinic.

405
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,640
In 1x24 hours, Professor Aldebaran will be back.

406

For the sake of Professor Aldebaran's safety,

411
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I will enchant this door.

412

I, Reng Vega, can defeat it.

Of course, I'm the strongest.

But there's more.

426
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Centaurus has a white tiger.

427
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,640
Its body is huge.

428
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,640
I almost got kicked.

He killed my parents.

Because of him, I became a orphan.

Because of him, I don't know who my parents are.

But one thing is clear.

462

No matter how strong the evil is,

463
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,640
at some point, it will be destroyed by good.

464

With this ring, you will not be defeated.

Your only weakness is if the ring is detached from you.

Now, destroy that skull.
