Oh my God, this wound is very bad

And must be treated immediately with energy transfer

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The sword of the savior

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sword of the savior?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Defatambarga

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Destroy them all, Bar

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't let them enter the castle

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let me go

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to remember Alfa

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Vega, Ray, Soleh, have you got the sword?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not yet, bro, now Alfa is the one who is wrong to be the sword

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alfa?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They will definitely meet

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If the dark lord will catch and finish Alfa

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will finish them all

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The head of the headless school, Aldubaran

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But don't worry for me

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will infuse Aldubaran, I will help you

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just that, what I will infuse is not the dragon to Alubaran

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But poison

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Poison, poison, where is the poison?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I need help

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where is the poison?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I need help

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Alfa, wake up Alfa

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Alfa, wake up

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are the one who has been missing for two years

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why do you come to my dream?

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alfa, do you know who that kid is?

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who?

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That kid is you

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Alfa, you are the one who has been missing for two years

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You and my father, right?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If they are my father's servants

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If I am not taken care of

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then where are they now?

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Of course they don't take care of you

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because they are old

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They are not your children

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Even if they don't take care of you

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because they are both dead

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Dead?

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why is the rain so heavy?

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ketomi, please, sir

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Professor Ankara is attacking Professor Alubaran

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What?

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Kau Vega, Kare, and Katole are fighting him

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I don't know if they are strong enough or not

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have to do something

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Jack, wait for the kids

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We have to save Professor Alubaran

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, sir

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you, Ketomi

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Guys!

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We have to help Professor Alubaran

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He is fighting Professor Ankara

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Boss!

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Have you got it?

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I have

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's find the other eggs

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's wrong?

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a monster!

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Run!

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's wrong?

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a monster!

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Run!

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ankara!

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Kids!

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Stop them!

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Kids!

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Stop them!

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Say it!

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Feel it!

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Dad!

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are you here?

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We want to help you

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Guys, let's get ready

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey!

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you think you can defeat me?

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You underestimated me

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Even though you have 1.000

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You still can't defeat me

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Professor Ankara, don't be too cocky

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, we are special

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you want to know why they died?

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Guys!

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't hurt them

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let them go

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000

Let's go

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Guys!

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's go

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Guys!

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Guys!

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's go

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Guys!

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Guys!

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's go

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Guys!

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's go

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A drop of water from a chosen child

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Can bring back my power

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mr. Bonda!

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me go!

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mr. Hipok, the teeth can kill

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But you can kill it through the teeth

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The string is his weakness

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What did I teach you?

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You've killed your monster

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now listen to me

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Boku!

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Kids, you're all great

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Going to Egypt to buy turtles

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The magic children are really great

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah!

165
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Only your blood status left

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then my power is perfect

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Because your blood status

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Can bring back my power

169
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I don't give up

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't give up

171
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My blood is for a monster like you

172
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I fight to the death

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So you can't

174
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Take my blood anymore

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Who do you think you are?

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you know who you're facing?

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm the Dark Lord

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Your power

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can't beat mine

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I don't need your permission

181
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will take your blood

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For real

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Take his blood!

184
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Watch out!

185
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No!

186
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Watch out!

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Soon, the power that you've been hiding

188
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Will be back

189
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And it's all because of you, Alfa

190
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please go home, Alfa

191
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because your job is done

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I won't let the Dark Lord

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Come back!

194
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You've made me so angry, Alfa

195
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Feel this

196
00:16:37,000 --> 00:17:09,000
(Music)

197
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you know what this means?

198
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That is the torture mantra

199
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
(Laugh)

200
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
After you enter this room

201
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You will feel our torture

202
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Very amazing

203
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And you will ask your parents

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
(Laugh)

205
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Dad, Mom

206
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What is this time I met you?

207
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
(Laugh)

208
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,760
(Evil laugh)

209
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:58,300
(elloquial voice)

210
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,480
Alpha

211
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,120
Bro

212
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Mom

213
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,440
Now

214
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,200
I know who you are

215
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
Dad

216
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,780
Mom

217
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,220
I've been fighting

218
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,360
But I lost

219
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,340
Like this

220
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,480
I will meet you both

221
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,960
No, Ango

222
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,600
You can't give up

223
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,640
Yes, Ang. There will be a time when we meet again.

224
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,640
You must defeat the darkness.

225
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,140
You are our only hope.

226
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,820
How?

227
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,860
He's so strong. He has the power of a star.

228
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,620
Only with the determination and love that's in you can you defeat all evil, Alpha.

229
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,040
You must believe in yourself. You can do it.

230
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
(Epic music)

231
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,100
Okay

232
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,360
I won't give up.

233
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,180
Be patient, Alpha. There will be a time when we meet again.

234
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
(Epic music)

235
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:43,100
I can't give up. If the darkness gets my blood, it will get stronger. It will hurt a lot of people.

236
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,100
I must resist. For Sega, for Ray, for the stars, and for Tenara.

237
00:19:50,100 --> 00:20:01,320
Megazord

238
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:09,580
Red Bird, help me.

239
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:20,840
(Scream)

240
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:37,340
We can do it

241
00:20:37,340 --> 00:21:01,060
[Beep]

242
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:22,260

243
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,860
why weird, why can he suddenly disappear?

244
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,400
even though he followed

245
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,260
so our effort is in vain

246
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,760
hey

247
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
don't say in vain

248
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,760
there is a white chicken climbing a tree

249
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,260
don't be sad

250
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,160
because you have defeated Ankara

251
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,960
right, Ankara has escaped

252
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,660
you all managed to save professor Aldebaran

253

[music]

254
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
now

255
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,560
it's better for you to find and save Alfa

256
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,960
Vega

257
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160

Tole

259
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,960
you save Alfa

260
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
you go, save Alfa

261
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,460
and you can also bring the head of the dragon

262
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
yes, sir

263
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:28,260

264
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,760
wow, this is a big dragon

265
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
wow, it's so big

266
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Vega

267
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
next time

268
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
we will go to the forest

269
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm not afraid

270

271
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,760

!@#$%^&*(

280
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
What happened to me?

281
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Why am I here?

282
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,640
I thought I was swimming in the nature?

283
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm confused!

284
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Thank you, Garuda bird!

285
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm gone!

286
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:33,640
I have to find the sword

287
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
and go back to school.

288
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Why did you come here, Alfa?

289
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Are you looking for the sword?

290
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Yes.

291
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,640
The sword is not here.

292
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
It's my plan to trap you.

293
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,640
But...

294
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Doctor Pertiwi said that...

295
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Doctor Pertiwi?

296
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,640
He's been affected by hypnotism.

297
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
He will talk to you as I want.

298
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
You're a bad person!

299
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Enough, Alfa!

300
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
It's better...

301
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
if you join me...

302
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
than you die in vain.

303
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
You can be my guardian.

304
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,640
And we will rule this world!

305
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,640
No, I don't want to work with you!

306
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
You're a bad person!

307
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
You're a murderer!

308
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
You're so rude, Alfa!

309
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
How dare you to come to the dark side!

310
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,640
I'm focused!

311
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Ankara...

312
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,640
failed to get your blood.

313
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,640
But not with the help of darkness.

314
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640

315
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:22,640
It hurts!

316
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm Alfa.

317
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
You're Bil.

318
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
You want to be my guardian?

319
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
No!

320
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
I won't give up!

321
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,640
It hurts!

322
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Help!

323
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I think I hear Alfa's voice.

324
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Alfa, please show yourself to me.

325
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Alfa?

326
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Enough, Alfa!

327
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
It's useless to fight!

328
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
You're sick!

329
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Bite him!

330
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Let him go!

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Why are you here?

334
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
You want to give me your heart?

335
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Right?

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,640
Open your eyes, Alfa.

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm talking through your heart.

339
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Because only you can hear it.

340
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Come on, open your eyes.

Do you know what the task of a star is?

343
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,640
The task of a star is to increase my power!

344
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Wrong.

345
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
The task of a star is...

The darkness wants to sweat, tears, and my blood.

We can do it!

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,640
It's Alfa!

Yes, just take it as my reward.

Because you helped me to go back to the sky.

388

There's no sword.

389
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
This is just a trick.

390
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
This is a trap.

Dr. Pertiwi can't be lying.

Dr. Pertiwi is not lying.

394
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,640
He was just hypnotized by Professor Angkara.

395
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:43,640
It's true, guys.

396
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,640
It's true.

397
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640

Then I met Professor Angkara.

399

00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
It's scary.

401
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Now, Pertiwi, how do we save Professor Aldebaran?

402
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
This kind of energy transmission is the best.

403
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Now, Professor Aldebaran can rest in the clinic.

404
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,640
In 1x24 hours, Professor Aldebaran will be back.

405

For the sake of Professor Aldebaran's safety,

410
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I will enchant this door.

411
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,640

I, Reng Vega, can defeat it.

Of course, I'm the strongest.

But there's more.

425
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Centaurus has a white tiger.

426
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,640
Its body is huge.

427
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,640
I almost got kicked.

You can defeat Centaurus by yourself.

He killed my parents.

Because of him, I became a orphan.

Because of him, I don't know who my parents are.

But one thing is clear.

461

No matter how strong the evil is,

462
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,640
at some point, it will be destroyed by good.

463

With this ring, you will not be defeated.

Your only weakness is if the ring is detached from you.

Now, destroy that skull.

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,640
