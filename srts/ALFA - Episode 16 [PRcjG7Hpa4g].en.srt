1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh my God, this wound is very bad

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And must be treated immediately with energy transfer

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The sword of the savior

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sword of the savior?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Defatambarga

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Destroy them all, Bar

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't let them enter the castle

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let me go

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to remember Alfa

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Vega, Ray, Soleh, have you got the sword?

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not yet, bro, now Alfa is the one who is wrong to be the sword

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alfa?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They will definitely meet

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If the dark lord will catch and finish Alfa

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will finish them all

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The head of the headless school, Aldubaran

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But don't worry for me

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will infuse Aldubaran, I will help you

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just that, what I will infuse is not the dragon to Alubaran

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But poison

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Poison, poison, where is the poison?

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I need help

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where is the poison?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I need help

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Alfa, wake up Alfa

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Alfa, wake up

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are the one who has been missing for two years

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why do you come to my dream?

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alfa, do you know who that kid is?

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who?

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That kid is you

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Alfa, you are the one who has been missing for two years

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You and my father, right?

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If they are my father's servants

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If I am not taken care of

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then where are they now?

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Of course they don't take care of you

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because they are old

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They are not your children

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Even if they don't take care of you

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because they are both dead

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Dead?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why is the rain so heavy?

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ketomi, please, sir

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Professor Ankara is attacking Professor Alubaran

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Kau Vega, Kare, and Katole are fighting him

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I don't know if they are strong enough or not

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have to do something

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Jack, wait for the kids

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We have to save Professor Alubaran

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, sir

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you, Ketomi

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Guys!

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We have to help Professor Alubaran

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He is fighting Professor Ankara

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Boss!

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Have you got it?

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I have

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's find the other eggs

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's wrong?

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a monster!

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Run!

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's wrong?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a monster!

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Run!

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ankara!

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Kids!

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Stop them!

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Kids!

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Stop them!

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Say it!

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Feel it!

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Dad!

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are you here?

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We want to help you

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Guys, let's get ready

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey!

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you think you can defeat me?

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You underestimated me

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Even though you have 1.000

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You still can't defeat me

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Professor Ankara, don't be too cocky

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, we are special

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you want to know why they died?

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Guys!

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't hurt them

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let them go

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Guys!

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's go

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000

Let's go

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000

Let's go

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Guys!

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's go

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's go

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Guys!

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's go

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Guys!

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's go

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Guys!

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Guys!

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Guys!

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's go

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Guys!

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's go

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Guys!

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's go

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Guys!

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's go

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Guys!

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Guys!

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's go

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Guys!

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's go

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Guys!

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's go

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Guys!

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Guys!

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's go

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Guys!

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's go

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A drop of water from a chosen child

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Can bring back my power

147
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mr. Bonda!

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me go!

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mr. Hipok, the teeth can kill

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But you can kill it through the teeth

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The string is his weakness

152
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What did I teach you?

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You've killed your monster

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now listen to me

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Boku!

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Kids, you're all great

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Going to Egypt to buy turtles

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The magic children are really great

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah!

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Only your blood status left

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then my power is perfect

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Because your blood status

165
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Can bring back my power

166
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I don't give up

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't give up

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My blood is for a monster like you

169
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I fight to the death

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So you can't

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Take my blood anymore

172
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Who do you think you are?

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you know who you're facing?

174
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm the Dark Lord

175
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Your power

176
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can't beat mine

177
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I don't need your permission

178
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will take your blood

179
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For real

180
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Take his blood!

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Watch out!

182
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No!

183
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Watch out!

184
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Soon, the power that you've been hiding

185
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Will be back

186
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And it's all because of you, Alfa

187
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please go home, Alfa

188
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because your job is done

189
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I won't let the Dark Lord

190
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Come back!

191
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You've made me so angry, Alfa

192
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Feel this

193
00:16:37,000 --> 00:17:09,000
(Music)

194
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you know what this means?

195
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That is the torture mantra

196
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
(Laugh)

197
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
After you enter this room

198
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You will feel our torture

199
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Very amazing

200
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And you will ask your parents

201
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
(Laugh)

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Dad, Mom

203
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What is this time I met you?

204
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
(Laugh)

205
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,760
(Evil laugh)

206
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:58,300
(elloquial voice)

207
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,480
Alpha

208
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,120
Bro

209
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Mom

210
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,440
Now

211
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,200
I know who you are

212
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
Dad

213
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,780
Mom

214
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,220
I've been fighting

215
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,360
But I lost

216
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,340
Like this

217
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,480
I will meet you both

218
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,960
No, Ango

219
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,600
You can't give up

220
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,640
Yes, Ang. There will be a time when we meet again.

221
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,640
You must defeat the darkness.

222
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,140
You are our only hope.

223
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,820
How?

224
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,860
He's so strong. He has the power of a star.

225
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,620
Only with the determination and love that's in you can you defeat all evil, Alpha.

226
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,040
You must believe in yourself. You can do it.

227
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
(Epic music)

228
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,100
Okay

229
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,360
I won't give up.

230
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,180
Be patient, Alpha. There will be a time when we meet again.

231
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
(Epic music)

232
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:43,100
I can't give up. If the darkness gets my blood, it will get stronger. It will hurt a lot of people.

233
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,100
I must resist. For Sega, for Ray, for the stars, and for Tenara.

234
00:19:50,100 --> 00:20:01,320
Megazord

235
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:09,580
Red Bird, help me.

236
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:20,840
(Scream)

237
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:37,340
We can do it

238
00:20:37,340 --> 00:21:01,060
[Beep]

239
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:22,260
[music]

240
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,860
why weird, why can he suddenly disappear?

241
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,400
even though he followed

242
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,260
so our effort is in vain

243
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,760
hey

244
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
don't say in vain

245
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,760
there is a white chicken climbing a tree

246
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,260
don't be sad

247
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,160
because you have defeated Ankara

248
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,960
right, Ankara has escaped

249
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,660
you all managed to save professor Aldebaran

250
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,460
[music]

251
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
now

252
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,560
it's better for you to find and save Alfa

253
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,960
Vega

254
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160

Tole

256
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,960
you save Alfa

257
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
you go, save Alfa

258
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,460
and you can also bring the head of the dragon

259
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
yes, sir

260
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:28,260
[music]

261
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,760
wow, this is a big dragon

262
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
wow, it's so big

263
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Vega

264
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
next time

265
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
we will go to the forest

266
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm not afraid

267
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760

268
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,760

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,760
wow, it's so big

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,760
it's so big

!@#$%^&*(

277
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
What happened to me?

278
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Why am I here?

279
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,640
I thought I was swimming in the nature?

280
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm confused!

281
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Thank you, Garuda bird!

282
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm gone!

283
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:33,640
I have to find the sword

284
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
and go back to school.

285
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Why did you come here, Alfa?

286
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Are you looking for the sword?

287
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Yes.

288
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,640
The sword is not here.

289
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
It's my plan to trap you.

290
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,640
But...

291
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Doctor Pertiwi said that...

292
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Doctor Pertiwi?

293
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,640
He's been affected by hypnotism.

294
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
He will talk to you as I want.

295
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
You're a bad person!

296
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Enough, Alfa!

297
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
It's better...

298
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
if you join me...

299
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
than you die in vain.

300
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
You can be my guardian.

301
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,640
And we will rule this world!

302
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,640
No, I don't want to work with you!

303
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
You're a bad person!

304
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
You're a murderer!

305
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
You're so rude, Alfa!

306
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
How dare you to come to the dark side!

307
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,640
I'm focused!

308
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Ankara...

309
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,640
failed to get your blood.

310
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,640
But not with the help of darkness.

311
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
[laughing]

312
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:22,640
It hurts!

313
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm Alfa.

314
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
You're Bil.

315
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
You want to be my guardian?

316
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
No!

317
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
I won't give up!

318
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,640
It hurts!

319
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Help!

320
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I think I hear Alfa's voice.

321
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Alfa, please show yourself to me.

322
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Alfa?

323
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Enough, Alfa!

324
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
It's useless to fight!

325
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
You're sick!

326
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Bite him!

327
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Let him go!

00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,640
My dear daughter.

330
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Why are you here?

331
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
You want to give me your heart?

332
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Right?

333
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640

334
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,640
Open your eyes, Alfa.

335
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm talking through your heart.

336
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Because only you can hear it.

337
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Come on, open your eyes.

339
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Do you know what the task of a star is?

340
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,640
The task of a star is to increase my power!

341
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Wrong.

342
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
The task of a star is...

343
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,640
to shine!

The darkness wants to sweat, tears, and my blood.

351
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:32,640
We can do it!

352
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,640
It's Alfa!

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,640

I can't even use my power!

Yes, just take it as my reward.

366
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Because you helped me to go back to the sky.

367
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Yes, you're welcome!

00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Come with me.

How are the kids?

384
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Did you get the sword?

385
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,640
There's no sword.

386
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
This is just a trick.

387
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
This is a trap.

388
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
The Dark Lord just wants to sweat, tears, and my blood.

Dr. Pertiwi is not lying.

391
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,640
He was just hypnotized by Professor Angkara.

392
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:43,640

393
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,640

It's scary.

398
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Now, Pertiwi, how do we save Professor Aldebaran?

399
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
This kind of energy transmission is the best.

Now, Professor Aldebaran can rest in the clinic.

401
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,640
In 1x24 hours, Professor Aldebaran will be back.

For the sake of Professor Aldebaran's safety,

407
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I will enchant this door.

But there's more.

422
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Centaurus has a white tiger.

423
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,640
Its body is huge.

424
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,640

But one thing is clear.

No matter how strong the evil is,

459
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,640
at some point, it will be destroyed by good.

With this ring, you will not be defeated.
