 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 To be continued...

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Oh my God, this wound is very bad

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And must be treated immediately with energy transfer

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 The sword of the savior

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 The sword of the savior?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Defatambarga

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Destroy them all, Bar

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Don't let them enter the castle

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Let me go

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I want to remember Alva

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Vega, Ray, Soleh, have you got the sword?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Not yet, bro, now Alva is the one who is wrong to be the sword

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Alva?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 They will definitely meet

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 If the dark lord will catch and finish Alva

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I will finish them all

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 The head of the headless school, Aldubaran

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 But don't worry for me

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I will infuse Aldubaran, I will help you

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Just that, what I will infuse is not the dragon to Alubaran

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But poison

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Poison, poison, where is the poison?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I need help

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Where is the poison?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I need help

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Alva, wake up Alva

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Alva, wake up

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 You are the one who has been missing for two years

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Why do you come to my dream?

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Alva, do you know who that kid is?

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Who?

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 That kid is you

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Alva, you are the one who has been missing for two years

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 You and my father, right?

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 That's right

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 If they are my father's servants

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 If I am not taken care of

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Then where are they now?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Of course they don't take care of you

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Because they are old

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 They are not your children

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Even if they don't take care of you

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Because they are both dead

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Dead?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Why is the rain so heavy?

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Ketomi, please, sir

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Professor Ankara is attacking Professor Alubaran

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 What?

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Kau Vega, Kare, and Katole are fighting him

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But I don't know if they are strong enough or not

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 We have to do something

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Jack, wait for the kids

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 We have to save Professor Alubaran

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Okay, sir

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Thank you, Ketomi

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Guys!

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 We have to help Professor Alubaran

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 He is fighting Professor Ankara

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Let's go

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Boss!

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Have you got it?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Yes, I have

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Let's find the other eggs

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 What's wrong?

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It's a monster!

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Run!

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 What's wrong?

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 It's a monster!

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Run!

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Ankara!

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Kids!

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Stop them!

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Kids!

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Stop them!

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Say it!

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Feel it!

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Dad!

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Dad!

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Dad!

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Why are you here?

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 We want to help you

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Guys, let's get ready

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Hey!

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Do you think you can defeat me?

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 You underestimated me

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Even though you have 1.000

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 You still can't defeat me

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Professor Ankara, don't be too cocky

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Yes, we are special

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Do you want to know why they died?

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Guys!

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Don't hurt them

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Let them go

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 To be continued...

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 A drop of water from a chosen child

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Can bring back my power

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Mr. Bonda!

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Let me go!

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Let me go!

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Mr. Hipok, the teeth can kill

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 But you can kill it through the teeth

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 The string is his weakness

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Yes

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 What?

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 What did I teach you?

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 You've killed your monster

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Now listen to me

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Boku!

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Kids, you're all great

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Going to Egypt to buy turtles

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 The magic children are really great

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Yeah!

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 To be continued...

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 To be continued...

191
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Only your blood status left

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Then my power is perfect

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Because your blood status

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Can bring back my power

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 No, I don't give up

196
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I don't give up

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 My blood is for a monster like you

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I fight to the death

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So you can't

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Take my blood anymore

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Who do you think you are?

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Do you know who you're facing?

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I'm the Dark Lord

204
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Your power

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Can't beat mine

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And I don't need your permission

207
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I will take your blood

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 For real

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Take his blood!

210
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Watch out!

211
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Watch out!

212
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Watch out!

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Watch out!

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Watch out!

215
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 No!

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Watch out!

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Soon, the power that you've been hiding

218
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Will be back

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And it's all because of you, Alva

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Please go home, Alva

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Because your job is done

222
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I won't let the Dark Lord

223
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Come back!

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 You've made me so angry, Alva

225
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Feel this

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Do you know what this means?

243
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 That is the torture mantra

244
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 (Laugh)

245
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 After you enter this room

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 You will feel our torture

247
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Very amazing

248
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And you will ask your parents

249
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 (Laugh)

250
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000

251
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 (Laugh)

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Dad, Mom

255
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 What is this time I met you?

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 (Laugh)

257
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,760
 (Evil laugh)

258
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:58,300
 (elloquial voice)

259
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,480
 Alpha

260
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,120
 Bro

261
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
 Mom

262
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,440
 Now

263
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,200
 I know who you are

264
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
 Dad

265
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,780
 Mom

266
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,220
 I've been fighting

267
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,360
 But I lost

268
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,340
 Like this

269
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,480
 I will meet you both

270
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,960
 No, Ango

271
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,600
 You can't give up

272
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,640
 Yes, Ang. There will be a time when we meet again.

273
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,640
 You must defeat the darkness.

274
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,140
 You are our only hope.

275
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,820
 How?

276
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,860
 He's so strong. He has the power of a star.

277
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,620
 Only with the determination and love that's in you can you defeat all evil, Alpha.

278
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,040
 You must believe in yourself. You can do it.

279
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
 (Epic music)

280
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,100
 Okay

281
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,360
 I won't give up.

282
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,180
 Be patient, Alpha. There will be a time when we meet again.

283
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
 (Epic music)

284
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:43,100
 I can't give up. If the darkness gets my blood, it will get stronger. It will hurt a lot of people.

285
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,100
 I must resist. For Sega, for Ray, for the stars, and for Tenara.

286
00:19:50,100 --> 00:20:01,320
 Megazord

287
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:09,580
 Red Bird, help me.

288
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500

289
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:18,840

 (Scream)

291
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,340
 We can do it

292
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:37,340
 We can do it

293
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,260

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,860
 why weird, why can he suddenly disappear?

301
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,400
 even though he followed

302
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,260
 so our effort is in vain

303
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,760
 hey

304
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
 don't say in vain

305
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,760
 there is a white chicken climbing a tree

306
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,260
 don't be sad

307
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,160
 because you have defeated Ankara

308
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,960
 right, Ankara has escaped

309
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,660
 you all managed to save professor Aldebaran

 [music]

311
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
 now

312
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,560
 it's better for you to find and save Alfa

313
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,960
 Vega

314
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160

 Tole

316
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,960
 you save Alfa

317
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
 you go, save Alfa

318
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,460
 and you can also bring the head of the dragon

319
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
 yes, sir

320
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:28,260

321
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,760
 wow, this is a big dragon

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
 wow, it's so big

323
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
 Vega

324
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
 next time

325
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
 we will go to the forest

326
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 I'm not afraid

 Why am I here?

346
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,640
 I thought I was swimming in the nature?

 I'm confused!

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,640
 Thank you, Garuda bird!

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
 I'm gone!

350
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:33,640
 I have to find the sword

351
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
 and go back to school.

352
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,640
 Why did you come here, Alva?

353
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
 Are you looking for the sword?

354
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
 Yes.

355
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,640
 The sword is not here.

356
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
 It's my plan to trap you.

357
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,640
 But...

358
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
 Doctor Pertiwi said that...

359
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
 Doctor Pertiwi?

360
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,640
 He's been affected by hypnotism.

361
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
 He will talk to you as I want.

362
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
 You're a bad person!

363
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
 Enough, Alva!

364
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
 It's better...

365
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 if you join me...

366
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
 than you die in vain.

367
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
 You can be my guardian.

368
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,640
 And we will rule this world!

369
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,640
 No, I don't want to work with you!

370
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
 You're a bad person!

371
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
 You're a murderer!

372
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
 You're so rude, Alva!

373
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,640
 How dare you to come to the dark side!

374
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,640
 I'm focused!

375
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,640
 Ankara...

376
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,640
 failed to get your blood.

377
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,640
 But not with the help of darkness.

00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:22,640
 It hurts!

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
 I'm Alva.

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
 You're Bil.

382
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 You want to be my guardian?

383
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
 No!

384
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
 I won't give up!

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:53,640
 Help!

00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640

 Alva, please show yourself to me.

393
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:20,640
 Alva?

394
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
 Enough, Alva!

395
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
 It's useless to fight!

396
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
 You're sick!

397
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:35,640
 Bite him!

398
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:44,640
 Let him go!

400
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,640
 My dear daughter.

401
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 Why are you here?

402
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
 You want to give me your heart?

403
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
 Right?

404
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
 [laughing]

405
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,640
 Open your eyes, Alva.

406
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
 I'm talking through your heart.

407
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
 Because only you can hear it.

408
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
 Come on, open your eyes.

409
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,640
 Pangeran.

410
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
 Do you know what the task of a star is?

411
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,640
 The task of a star is to increase my power!

412
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
 Wrong.

413
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
 The task of a star is...

414
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,640
 to shine!

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:45,640
 My eyes!

417
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,640
 Alva, let's get out of here.

418
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 Run!

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 Alva!

 Alva!

422
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 The darkness wants to sweat, tears, and my blood.

423
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,640
 We can do it!

424
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:32,640
 We can do it!

425
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,640
 It's Alva!

426
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
 Alva!

427
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
 Alva!

428
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
 Alva, fly!

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:05,640
 Up!

 How dare you!

437
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 I can't even use my power!

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640

439
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,640
 Thank you, Celena!

440
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,640
 Yes, just take it as my reward.

441
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,640
 Because you helped me to go back to the sky.

442
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
 Yes, you're welcome!

443
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
 Come with me.

444
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
 Come on, friends.

445
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
 Wow.

446
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
 Goodbye, Alva.

447
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
 Goodbye, Vega and Ray.

449
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,640
 I know Vega and Alva, Ray.

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
 Who are they?

451
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
 They're beautiful.

452
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,640
 Let's go back to the school.

 The dust is separated by the sun.

00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,640
 Thank God, Alva is safe now.

460
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,640
 How are the kids?

461
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,640
 Did you get the sword?

462
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,640
 There's no sword.

463
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
 This is just a trick.

464
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
 This is a trap.

465
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
 The Dark Lord just wants to sweat, tears, and my blood.

466
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
 Dr. Pertiwi can't be lying.

467
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
 Dr. Pertiwi is not lying.

468
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,640
 He was just hypnotized by Professor Angkara.

469
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:43,640
 It's true, guys.

470
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
 It's true.

471
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,640
 It's true.

472
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
 I was looking for Mushroom.

473
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
 Then I met Professor Angkara.

474
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
 I was hypnotized.

475
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
 It's scary.

476
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,640
 Now, Pertiwi, how do we save Professor Aldebaran?

477
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
 This kind of energy transmission is the best.

478
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,640
 Now, Professor Aldebaran can rest in the clinic.

479
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,640
 In 1x24 hours, Professor Aldebaran will be back.

480
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 Isn't it amazing?

481
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
 Thank God.

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:29,640
 Wait.

485
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,640
 For the sake of Professor Aldebaran's safety,

486
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
 I will enchant this door.

487
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,640
 So that only the master can enter.

488
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
 Good idea, Professor Purwa.

489
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
 Good.

490
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
 Lock the door.

491
00:33:48,640 --> 00:34:00,640
 While I was on an adventure,

492
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,640
 I met Centaurus.

493
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,640
 It's a human head.

494
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,640
 But it has a horse's body.

495
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640

496
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,640
 Can you defeat it?

497
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
 Of course.

498
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,640
 I, Reng Vega, can defeat it.

499
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,640
 Of course, I'm the strongest.

500
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,640
 But there's more.

501
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,640
 Centaurus has a white tiger.

502
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,640
 Its body is huge.

503
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,640
 I almost got kicked.

504
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 Why are you quiet?

505
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
 I'm the strongest.

506
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:59,640
 You're so strong.

507
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,640
 You can defeat Centaurus by yourself.

508
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,640
 How can you defeat Centaurus by yourself?

509
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
 Tell me.

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
 Why does he always come to me?

516
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,640
 Alva, do you know who that baby is?

517
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
 Who?

518
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
 That baby is you.

 Alva, what's wrong?

522
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
 Come on.

523
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
 Tell me.

524
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
 Tell us.

525
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
 Why?

526
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
 I'm scared.

527
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
 He's evil.

528
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,640
 He killed my parents.

529
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:42,640
 First, my father was attacked.

530
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,640
 Then he was burned.

531
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,640
 Then my mother was attacked.

532
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,640
 Because of him, I became a orphan.

533
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:06,640
 Because of him, I don't know who my parents are.

534
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:15,640
 I don't know why there's an evil person in this world.

536
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:38,640
 Alva, not everything in this world can be understood.

537
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,640
 But one thing is clear.

538
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,640
 No matter how strong the evil is,

539
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,640
 at some point, it will be destroyed by good.

540
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,640
 Because in the end, the good will win.

 You're rude.

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,640
 I'm sorry, sir.

545
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,640
 I don't know if the chosen one can use his power to summon Pegasus.

546
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,640
 Angara, we don't have time.

547
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,640
 Before there's a unique item, we must get that baby.

548
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,640
 But how, sir?

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:56,640

 Sir, do you want to use Varga again?

553
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
 It's useless, sir.

554
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,640
 Because Alva knows how to defeat Varga.

555
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,640
 I will make Varga again.

 Take this!

559
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,640
 With this ring, you will not be defeated.

560
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,640
 Your only weakness is if the ring is detached from you.

561
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,640
 Now, destroy that skull.

562
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,640
 Bring Aldebaran here.

563
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
 Hurry!

564
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:19,640
 By defeating Aldebaran,

565
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,640
 the baby will be defeated by us.

569
00:40:48,640 --> 00:41:01,640
 Today, we will learn the Batu Mantra.

570
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,640
 A mantra that you can use to defend yourself.

571
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,640
 The mantra is...

572
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
 ...Divinjo.

573
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
 This mantra...

574
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,640
 ...implies the power that comes from within you.

575
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,640
 Imagine...

576
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
 ...the person you love...

577
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
 ...is sick.

578
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
 You want to protect him.

579
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,640
 You want to do something.

580
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
 The greater your power,

581
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,640
 the greater your ability to protect the person you love,
