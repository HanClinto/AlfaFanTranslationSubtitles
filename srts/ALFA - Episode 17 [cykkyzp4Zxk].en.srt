1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There is no name, this is just a lie, this is a trap, the evil spirits only want my sweat, tears and blood

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You promised me, you will not forget, your promise is only one, if that promise is broken from you

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alfa

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We can't give up Alfa to them

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it's better if there is someone among us to disguise as Alfa

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who is this person?

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Myself

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who is it?

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who is handsome?

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hi

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Come on, let's gather

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's going on?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why are we gathered here?

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I deliberately gathered you all

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to tell you, if professor Aldebaran is kidnapped by the evil spirits

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Kidnapped?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So we have to save the professor and we have to defeat the evil spirits

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But how?

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The monster is strong, the professor is more powerful than the monster

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Calm down, I know how

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Actually, the one being targeted is Alfa, not the professor

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So if we want our professor to be safe, we have to surrender Alfa

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go find Alfa now

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Professor is safe

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where are you?

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Alfa

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Have you met Alfa?

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Not yet, she's not in the library

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where is she?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Have you met Alfa?

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, she's not in the library either

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Where is she?

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She's not in the library either

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Where is Alfa?

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where is she?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where is Alfa?

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We're looking for her

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She was with us when we attacked the evil spirits, but now she's gone

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe Alfa is hiding

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Maybe she's running away

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Maybe she's in the library

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alfa is not like that

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where is Alfa?

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What should we use?

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's use the kite

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's right, we should use the kite

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm going to find Alfa

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Gawat, it's really you

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What's wrong?

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Alfa was kidnapped by the evil spirits

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
She's in the hallway

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh no

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What should we do?

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're in trouble

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What happened?

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Alfa was kidnapped

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go tell the professor

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I got you

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're lying

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm going to find Alfa

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm going to find Alfa

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm going to find Alfa

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Alfa

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going to find the professor

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to find the professor

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Professor Langni

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Professor Langni is not here

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Where is he?

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's in the hallway

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm scared

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's not here

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Professor Purwocoki is not here either

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What about him?

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yasmin is not here either

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What should we do?

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm scared

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's weird, how can they be together?

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing here?

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're looking for Professor Agni

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Professor Agni and all teachers are on their way

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Where are they?

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
They're going to the place where the dark spirits help the professor

98
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But we're asking for Alfa

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't worry, be happy

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Megantarate is eager to be Alfa

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So they're going there with a fake Alfa

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Isn't it amazing?

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But it's even worse

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then?

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We should ask for help from others

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's go

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh my god, they're so childish

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Wait for me, don't go

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have to defeat Barga before we get to the place where the dark spirits help

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're going to the dark spirit's house

111
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There must be a clue here

112
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm going to look for it

113
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The dark spirit's house has a ring

114
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's very magical

115
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And it can make monsters stronger

116
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I know how to do it

117
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Guys!

118
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I can't do it

119
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Guys!

120
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm going to find the weak point

121
00:17:40,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm going to break it

122
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:38,000
My legs are aching

123
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can't stand up

124
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What should I do?

125
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's up to you

126
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
With your blood

127
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I can perfect your power

128
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Professor Aldi Baharan

129
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Where is he?

130
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where is Professor Aldi?

131
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Shut up!

132
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't ask questions

133
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:31,000
How is it? Are we ready?

134
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes

135
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Now, let's go

136
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How is it? Are we ready?

137
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes

138
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Now, let's go

139
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's go

140
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We have to help Alfa

141
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
One, two, three

142
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's go!

143
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
[The power of the universe]

144
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What is it?

145
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
[The power of the universe]

146
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Brother!

147
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Brother, I can't stand it anymore!

148
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm going to die!

149
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Brother!

150
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hold on, sister!

151
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you, Brita

152
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're welcome

153
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Alfa!

154
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hi, friends

155
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
How did you know I'm here?

156
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm here because you're flying!

157
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, you're so used to it

158
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're making yourself a burden

159
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You!

160
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, sister

161
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We're all worried

162
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, then

163
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You have no other choice

164
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm the only one

165
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Who can help Professor Aldi Baharan

166
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So, I'm chasing after him

167
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you all

168
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
For helping me

169
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm so proud of you

170
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But, Barga can't be defeated

171
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Alfa, the ring!

172
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Barga's ring has a weakness

173
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If he wears it, he'll be strong

174
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So, the weakness is in the ring?

175
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We'll make a plan

176
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But, before that

177
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Catch him!

178
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You have to eat first

179
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you eat, your energy will be full

180
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And your leg won't hurt anymore

181
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay

182
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:32,000
My leg doesn't hurt anymore!

183
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're right, sister!

184
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's make a plan!

185
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Alfa, the ring!

186
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Why is it so dark?

187
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Alfa

188
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm going to take your blood

189
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay

190
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Take the blood

191
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Take it

192
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Alfa

193
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why are you a murderer?

194
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't know

195
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe he's very curious

196
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because he's the only one who can help Professor Aldi Baharan

197
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Wear the ring

198
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Take the hair

199
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you want to take the blood

200
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Hurry up

201
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can wear the shawl

202
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You're lazy

203
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anggara

204
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think there's something wrong with Alfa

205
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Maybe she's stressed

206
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It doesn't matter what you do

207
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It doesn't matter

208
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What matters is your blood

209
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
With your blood

210
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I can perfect my power

211
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Take the blood

212
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Take it

213
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Is that all?

214
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Have a good time, Alfa

215
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, Professor

216
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm going to take the blood

217
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You got it

218
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You're so weak

219
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I feel sorry for you

220
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Attack!

221
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm going to take the blood

222
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Attack!

223
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Rita, that's his ring

224
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Get closer

225
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay

226
00:25:38,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Attack!

227
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Alfa, are you okay?

228
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm okay

229
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
My hand is so big

230
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's hard to get the ring

231
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What should I do?

232
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I have an idea

233
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Get the oil

234
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm going to use it

235
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I hope it works

236
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay, guys

237
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's attack him

238
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Let's go

239
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Attack!

240
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Rita, get closer

241
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Okay

242
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Attack!

243
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm going to take the blood

244
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Attack!

245
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Get the ring!

246
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Attack!

247
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
How is it, brother?

248
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The blood is ready

249
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Good

250
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
With this blood

251
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
My knowledge will be perfect

252
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I won't be defeated

253
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Hahaha

254
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm going to take the blood

255
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Anggar!

256
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Why don't you react to me?

257
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't know, sir

258
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Is it a misunderstanding?

259
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I bought a meatball

260
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I threw it wrong

261
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Why did you do that, Anggar?

262
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I was fooled

263
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's time

264
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm going to take care of the rest

265
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Let's go, Ma

266
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I want to go to Tara

267
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You can use Tongsis

268
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Or you can use Tongsis

269
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's up to you

270
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's easy

271
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm going to use Tongsis

272
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's fast

273
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Let's go together

274
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Ouch! It hurts!

275
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's so hot

276
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm hungry

277
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Let's go to the village

278
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Let's go

279
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Don't eat me

280
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm hungry

281
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's go

282
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
We have to be hungry

283
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Don't you know that?

284
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I know

285
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm hungry

286
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But I don't want to eat you

287
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You're so mean

288
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But it's not a normal meatball

289
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's a meatball that has been castrated

290
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Don't you remember Professor Agni?

291
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Now we're going to learn about castration

292
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Which is a magic bean

293
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now you have a bean in front of you

294
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You plant it in the ground

295
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But be careful

296
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't let it get wet

297
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Okay, ma'am

298
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The bean is castrated

299
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Can I?

300
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Please help me, ma'am

301
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You can't

302
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I told you from the beginning

303
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You can't let the bean get wet

304
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Now you'll see what happens

305
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Please help me, ma'am

306
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Remember

307
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Imagine

308
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You want to eat this bean

309
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And if you eat it

310
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You'll get a sting

311
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And you'll get a sting

312
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's so fun

313
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I can't do it

314
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't want to do it anymore

315
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm going to the class

316
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Guys

317
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I have an idea

318
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:34,000
One, two, three

319
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Sting!

320
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Okay

321
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Let's take the bean

322
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Ouch

323
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Sting!

324
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm

325
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Sting

326
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Ouch

327
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Guys

328
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Throw the bean

329
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Up

330
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Guys

331
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Count down

332
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
To the sky

333
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Sting!

334
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Ouch

335
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Guys!

336
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Professor fell!

337
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Guys!

338
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Help professor!

339
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's go!

340
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah! We made it!

341
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah!

342
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
What the Simpsons

343
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Doesn't Joke!

344
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
[Laugh]

345
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah!

346
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm so happy!

347
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Thank you, guys!

348
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Now, I'm a champion!

349
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
[Laugh]

350
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Of course you are!

351
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Don't!

352
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
[Laugh]

353
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Stop!

354
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
[Laugh]

355
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's better to go to school!

356
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
[Laugh]

357
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I think there's something

358
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Anggar, look at that!

359
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
There's Alfa!

360
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It means he's with us!

361
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Anggar...

362
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I mean...

363
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Professor Anggar...

364
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes, Professor Anggar...

365
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm sorry, I...

366
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm just walking around...

367
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm actually really hungry...

368
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I've been hurt...

369
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You're really Megantara!

370
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You're really lucky...

371
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's really nice...

372
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
To be fooled by Megantara...

373
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You're so rude!

374
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Emotions will never help...

375
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm sorry...

376
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Is this an attack?

377
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Why?

378
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You must be scared...

379
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What's wrong?

380
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Are we fighting?

381
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
There's a lot of discussion...

382
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Megantara...

383
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I admit defeat...

384
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's no use to fight...

385
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What did you say?

386
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Admit defeat?

387
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Please take Aldebaran...

388
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And leave!

389
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
He's in the next room...

390
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Are you serious?

391
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Bro!

392
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Before we fight...

393
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay...

394
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Excuse me...

395
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Watch your fingers...

396
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Guys, this is Aldebaran's office...

397
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I want to see Aldebaran...

398
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Guys, Aldebaran's office is upside down...

399
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Guys, come here...

400
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Aldebaran's office is upside down...

401
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You guys have succeeded...

402
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You're the monsters...

403
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't believe it...

404
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well, it worked...

405
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's all thanks to Alfa...

406
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You guys are so awesome...

407
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
[Laughter]

408
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Alfa is awesome!

409
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Oh my God...

410
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You guys have brought...

411
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Professor Aldebaran back here...

412
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's a new grip...

413
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You guys are awesome...

414
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Amazing...

415
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I have to tell the other professors...

416
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Professor Aldebaran is back...

417
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
He's saved by...

418
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Alfa, Vega, Ray, Tole and Pelita...

419
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Where's Megantar?

420
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Why is he so late?

421
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
How's Professor Aldebaran?

422
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Professor Aldebaran is safe...

423
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
He's saved by...

424
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Alfa, Vega, Tole, Ray and Pelita...

425
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Thank God...

426
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
We were right to educate them...

427
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
They're now...

428
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Our best students...

429
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
They're now...

430
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Very brave and brave...

431
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes, very good...

432
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Come on...

433
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Now we go back to the school...

434
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Professor Purwa...

435
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
How about Megantara now?

436
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Professor Agni...

437
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Since the beginning, Megantara told me...

438
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The most important thing...

439
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Is the safety of Professor Aldebaran...

440
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
He can protect himself...

441
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And now...

442
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
After we've come this far...

443
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You want to leave Megantara just like that?

444
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Megantara herself offered herself...

445
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
To disguise as Alfa...

446
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
She knows what the risk is...

447
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Right...

448
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Megantara's knowledge is already high enough...

449
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And she can handle it herself...

450
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
No...

451
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I won't go back...

452
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
If you want to go home...

453
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You're welcome...

454
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'll wait here...

455
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's up to you, Professor Agni...

456
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You're welcome, Lolip...

457
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
If there's anything...

458
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Let me know...

459
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So...

460
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
How's Professor Aldebaran?

461
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's okay...

462
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Professor Aldebaran...

463
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
In a few hours...

464
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Will wake up...

465
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Good...

466
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Wait...

467
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Why is it just the two of you?

468
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Professor Agni...

469
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And Megantara...

470
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Where is...?

471
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Megantara is now at the palace...

472
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Of the dark wizard...

473
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And Professor Agni is waiting for him to return...

474
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
What?

475
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Megantara...

476
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Is there a place for the dark wizard?

477
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yes...

478
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
He's comfortable...

479
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So, what about you?

480
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You didn't say...

481
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes...

482
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Because I forgot...

483
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I was thinking about how to fight the wizard...

484
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Okay...

485
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What are you doing?

486
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Megantara has been captured...

487
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And will be destroyed by the dark wizard...

488
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Be careful...

489
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
To come...

490
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And you...

491
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Don't be late again...

492
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Or Megantara will not forgive you...

493
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I won't let the dark wizard hurt Tara...

494
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Alpha...

495
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Where are you going?

496
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
What is that?

497
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Mega...

498
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Why are you here?

499
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
What's up?

500
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Alpha...

501
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Heard the words of the bird...

502
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
He was startled...

503
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And he wants to attack Tara...

504
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Alpha...

505
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
You're a stubborn child...

506
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Stubborn...

507
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Please, Alpha...

508
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
He will be attacked by the dark wizard...

509
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Alpha...

510
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
What are you doing here?

511
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I want to meet the dark wizard...

512
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Come back...

513
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Alpha...

514
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Don't be stubborn...

515
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You have to go home now...

516
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
No, professor...

517
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I can't go home...

518
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If Tara is still in the dark wizard's castle...

519
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Alpha, I order you to go home now...

520
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I can't, professor...

521
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I don't want to see anyone...

522
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Be a victim because of me...

523
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Dark wizard...

524
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm here...

525
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Come out...

526
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Dark wizard...

527
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What are you doing, Alpha?

528
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Now I order you to go home...

529
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Or you will be punished...

530
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Alpha...

531
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
You go home now...

532
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Or I will kick you out of the school...

533
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't want to be kicked out...

534
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I want to see Tara safe...

535
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Welcome, Alpha...

536
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Dark wizard...

537
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
What have you done?

538
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It turns out this time is really Alpha...

539
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
If we are together now, it's for me, Alpha...

540
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
No, Alpha...

541
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You can't go...

542
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I want to go, professor...

543
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I can take care of myself...

544
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
No, Alpha...

545
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You have to stay here, Alpha...

546
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Let me go, Alpha...

547
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
No, Ankara...

548
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's better if you take me away...

549
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You have no rights...

550
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Let me go, Alpha...

551
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No...

552
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I will not let you go, Alpha...

553
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Come on, Alpha...

554
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Alpha...

555
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Let's go, Tiffy...

556
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Soldier...

557
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Soldier, wake up...

558
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Soldier...

559
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Soldier, wake up...

560
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Soldier, let's go...

561
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Come here...

562
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Soldier...

563
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Good, soldier...

564
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Good...

565
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Professor Ankara...

566
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
What are you doing, soldier?

567
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Why, Alpha?

568
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You must not have thought...

569
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
If Megantara...

570
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Has become my son...

571
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
My son...

572
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
[Laughter]

573
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Megantara...

574
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Now, you take my son's blood...

575
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
[Laughter]

576
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Don't, soldier...

577
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Soldier, don't...

578
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Megantara, hurry up...

579
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Do what you must...

580
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Attack him, Alpha...

581
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Attack him...

582
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Defend him...

583
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah...

584
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
[Laughter]

585
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Megantara...

586
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
How could I hypnotize you?

587
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Ankara...

588
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The sky won't fall for the second time...

589
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Professor Agni...

590
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You successfully hypnotized...

591
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Doctor Pertiwi...

592
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You hypnotized...

593
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But, I, Megantara...

594
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Can't hypnotize you...

595
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
[Laughter]

596
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This disguise is very dangerous for you, Megantara...

597
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You must be very careful...

598
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
That's right...

599
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
If Megantara finds out...

600
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
She will definitely be hypnotized...

601
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And she will definitely become their spy...

602
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Umm...

603
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
How about...

604
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
We learn...

605
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The anti-hypnotism mantra...

606
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Agree...

607
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Let's go...

608
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
What is the anti-hypnotism mantra that I remember...

609
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Your Dhotis...

610
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
How is this...

611
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It seems like the anti-hypnotism mantra didn't work...

612
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It seems like...

613
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Finally...

614
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Professor Agni has returned...

615
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yes...

616
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Finally...

617
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like that...

618
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Now you, Megantara...

619
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Me?

620
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Hypnotized?

621
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yes...

622
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Who's afraid?

623
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Try it...

624
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Megantara...

625
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
[Laughter]

626
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Finally...

627
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Finally what?

628
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Gravure Chobra...

629
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
The servant lifts the stone...

630
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You got money to play...

631
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
You all got fooled...

632
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You're all in luck...

633
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
[Laughter]

634
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Angkara...

635
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You're a cunning human...

636
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
A cunning human like you...

637
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Must be faced with...

638
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
A way that is no less cunning...

639
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Okay, Megantara...

640
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Let's attack...

641
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Alfa...

642
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Now is the time...

643
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We destroy him...

644
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Come on...

645
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
TV Go!

646
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Get ready, Alfa...

647
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
He's awake again...

648
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
This is Miran...

649
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Enough...

650
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I haven't lost...

651
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yes...

652
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
[Multiple voices]

653
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
[Laughter]

654
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Let's do it this way...

655
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
We have to check...

656
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Angkara...

657
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Is he insane...

658
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
To die...

659
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Or maybe...

660
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Just pretend...

661
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Umm...

662
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Alfa...

663
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I know...

664
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
How to find out...

665
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
If he's insane or just pretending...

666
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Look...

667
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Eh...

668
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Wow...

669
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
He's dead...

670
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Dead...

671
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yes...

672
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
A great army...

673
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Can fight...

674
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Professor Angkara's hypnotism...

675
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Alfa...

676
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
This is all because of you...

677
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Because of me?

678
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yes...

679
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I...

680
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Can control hypnotism...

681
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That's because I have the confidence and the strong will to save you...

682
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Because of the confidence and the confidence...

683
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That's why...

684
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
We succeeded...

685
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Because I don't want...

686
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Someone to harm you...

687
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Because of you...

688
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You're my favorite student, Alfa...

689
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Thank you, soldier...

690
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
[Laughter]

691
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Oh, soldier...

692
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Later...

693
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Teach me hypnotism, okay?

694
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You want to be able to hypnotize?

695
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
For you...

696
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
What do I give you?

697
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Don't give me a mantra about hypnotism...

698
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Mantra about the smell of butt...

699
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Mantra about the smell of pussy...

700
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'll definitely give you something...

701
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Later, you can...

702
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Ouch...

703
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
[Laughter]

704
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It's better...

705
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We get out of here quickly...

706
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Come on...

707
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Later...

708
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
What else?

709
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Let's run...

710
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Okay...

711
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
My backpack...

712
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You're always carrying your backpack...

713
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm not a person...

714
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'm running while carrying my backpack...

715
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm a coward...

716
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
But it's okay...

717
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Let's go, Nek...

718
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
[Laughter]

719
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm going to hypnotize you...

720
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Ready...

721
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Alfa...

722
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
You won't get away with this, Alfa...

723
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Help, sir...

724
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Help...

725
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Poor Alfa...

726
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes, that's right, Sir...

727
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So, you don't want to come with us?

728
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
No...

729
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Professor Abel Barante, forget...

730
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Professor Teng, fainted...

731
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
He was attacked by a dark wizard...

732
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I'm very, very hurt...

733
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Alfa...
