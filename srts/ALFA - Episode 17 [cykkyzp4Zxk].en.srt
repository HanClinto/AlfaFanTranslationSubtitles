1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There is no name, this is just a lie, this is a trap, the evil spirits only want my sweat, tears and blood

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You promised me, you will not forget, your promise is only one, if that promise is broken from you

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alva

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We can't give up Alva to them

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it's better if there is someone among us to disguise as Alva

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who is this person?

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Myself

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who is it?

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who is handsome?

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hi

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Come on, let's gather

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's going on?

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why are we gathered here?

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I deliberately gathered you all

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to tell you, if professor Aldebaran is kidnapped by the evil spirits

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Kidnapped?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So we have to save the professor and we have to defeat the evil spirits

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But how?

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The monster is strong, the professor is more powerful than the monster

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Calm down, I know how

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Actually, the one being targeted is Alva, not the professor

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So if we want our professor to be safe, we have to surrender Alva

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go find Alva now

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Professor is safe

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where are you?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Alva

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Have you met Alva?

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Not yet, she's not in the library

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where is she?

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Have you met Alva?

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, she's not in the library either

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Where is she?

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She's not in the library either

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Where is Alva?

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Where is she?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where is Alva?

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We're looking for her

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She was with us when we attacked the evil spirits, but now she's gone

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe Alva is hiding

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Maybe she's running away

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Maybe she's in the library

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alva is not like that

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where is Alva?

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What should we use?

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's use the kite

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's right, we should use the kite

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm going to find Alva

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Gawat, it's really you

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What's wrong?

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Alva was kidnapped by the evil spirits

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
She's in the hallway

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh no

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What should we do?

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're in trouble

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What happened?

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Alva was kidnapped

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go tell the professor

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I got you

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're lying

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm going to find Alva

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm going to find Alva

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm going to find Alva

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Alva

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going to find the professor

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to find the professor

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Professor Langni

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Professor Langni is not here

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Where is he?

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's in the hallway

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm scared

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's not here

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Professor Purwocoki is not here either

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What about him?

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yasmin is not here either

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What should we do?

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm scared

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's weird, how can they be together?

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing here?

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're looking for Professor Agni

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Professor Agni and all teachers are on their way

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Where are they?

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
They're going to the place where the dark spirits help the professor

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But we're asking for Alva

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't worry, be happy

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Megantarate is eager to be Alva

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So they're going there with a fake Alva

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Isn't it amazing?

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But it's even worse

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then?

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We should ask for help from others

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's go

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh my god, they're so childish

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Wait for me, don't go

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have to defeat Barga before we get to the place where the dark spirits help

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're going to the dark spirit's house

112
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There must be a clue here

113
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm going to look for it

114
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The dark spirit's house has a ring

115
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's very magical

116
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And it can make monsters stronger

117
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I know how to do it

118
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Guys!

119
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I can't do it

120
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Guys!

121
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm going to find the weak point

122
00:17:40,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm going to break it

123
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:38,000
My legs are aching

124
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can't stand up

125
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What should I do?

126
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's up to you

127
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
With your blood

128
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I can perfect your power

129
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Professor Aldi Baharan

130
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Where is he?

131
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where is Professor Aldi?

132
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Shut up!

133
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't ask questions

134
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:31,000
How is it? Are we ready?

135
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes

136
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Now, let's go

137
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How is it? Are we ready?

138
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes

139
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Now, let's go

140
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's go

141
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We have to help Alva

142
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
One, two, three

143
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's go!

144
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
[The power of the universe]

145
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What is it?

146
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
[The power of the universe]

147
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Brother!

148
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Brother, I can't stand it anymore!

149
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm going to die!

150
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Brother!

151
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hold on, sister!

152
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you, Brita

153
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're welcome

154
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Alva!

155
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hi, friends

156
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
How did you know I'm here?

157
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm here because you're flying!

158
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, you're so used to it

159
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're making yourself a burden

160
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You!

161
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, sister

162
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We're all worried

163
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, then

164
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You have no other choice

165
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm the only one

166
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Who can help Professor Aldi Baharan

167
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So, I'm chasing after him

168
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you all

169
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
For helping me

170
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm so proud of you

171
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But, Barga can't be defeated

172
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Alva, the ring!

173
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Barga's ring has a weakness

174
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If he wears it, he'll be strong

175
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So, the weakness is in the ring?

176
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We'll make a plan

177
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But, before that

178
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Catch him!

179
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You have to eat first

180
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you eat, your energy will be full

181
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And your leg won't hurt anymore

182
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay

183
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:32,000
My leg doesn't hurt anymore!

184
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're right, sister!

185
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's make a plan!

186
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Alva, the ring!

187
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Why is it so dark?

188
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Alva

189
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm going to take your blood

190
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay

191
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Take the blood

192
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Take it

193
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Alva

194
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why are you a murderer?

195
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't know

196
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe he's very curious

197
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because he's the only one who can help Professor Aldi Baharan

198
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Wear the ring

199
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Take the hair

200
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you want to take the blood

201
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Hurry up

202
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can wear the shawl

203
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You're lazy

204
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anggara

205
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think there's something wrong with Alva

206
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Maybe she's stressed

207
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It doesn't matter what you do

208
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It doesn't matter

209
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What matters is your blood

210
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
With your blood

211
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I can perfect my power

212
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Take the blood

213
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Take it

214
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Is that all?

215
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Have a good time, Alva

216
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, Professor

217
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm going to take the blood

218
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You got it

219
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You're so weak

220
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I feel sorry for you

221
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Attack!

222
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm going to take the blood

223
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Attack!

224
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Rita, that's his ring

225
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Get closer

226
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay

227
00:25:38,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Attack!

228
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Alva, are you okay?

229
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm okay

230
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
My hand is so big

231
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's hard to get the ring

232
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What should I do?

233
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I have an idea

234
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Get the oil

235
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm going to use it

236
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I hope it works

237
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay, guys

238
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's attack him

239
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Let's go

240
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Attack!

241
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Rita, get closer

242
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Okay

243
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Attack!

244
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm going to take the blood

245
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Attack!

246
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Get the ring!

247
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Attack!

248
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
How is it, brother?

249
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The blood is ready

250
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Good

251
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
With this blood

252
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
My knowledge will be perfect

253
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I won't be defeated

254
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Hahaha

255
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm going to take the blood

256
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Anggar!

257
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Why don't you react to me?

258
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't know, sir

259
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Is it a misunderstanding?

260
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I bought a meatball

261
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I threw it wrong

262
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Why did you do that, Anggar?

263
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I was fooled

264
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's time

265
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm going to take care of the rest

266
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Let's go, Ma

267
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I want to go to Tara

268
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You can use Tongsis

269
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Or you can use Tongsis

270
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's up to you

271
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's easy

272
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm going to use Tongsis

273
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's fast

274
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Let's go together

275
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Ouch! It hurts!

276
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's so hot

277
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm hungry

278
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Let's go to the village

279
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Let's go

280
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Don't eat me

281
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm hungry

282
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's go

283
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
We have to be hungry

284
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Don't you know that?

285
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I know

286
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm hungry

287
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But I don't want to eat you

288
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You're so mean

289
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But it's not a normal meatball

290
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's a meatball that has been castrated

291
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Don't you remember Professor Agni?

292
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Now we're going to learn about castration

293
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Which is a magic bean

294
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now you have a bean in front of you

295
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You plant it in the ground

296
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But be careful

297
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't let it get wet

298
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Okay, ma'am

299
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The bean is castrated

300
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Can I?

301
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Please help me, ma'am

302
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You can't

303
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I told you from the beginning

304
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You can't let the bean get wet

305
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Now you'll see what happens

306
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Please help me, ma'am

307
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Remember

308
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Imagine

309
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You want to eat this bean

310
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And if you eat it

311
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You'll get a sting

312
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And you'll get a sting

313
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's so fun

314
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I can't do it

315
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't want to do it anymore

316
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm going to the class

321
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Okay

322

Let's take the bean

323
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Ouch

329
