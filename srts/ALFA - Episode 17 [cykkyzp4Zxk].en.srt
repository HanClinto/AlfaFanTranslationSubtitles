 To be continued...

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000

 To be continued...

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 There is no name, this is just a lie, this is a trap, the evil spirits only want my sweat, tears and blood

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 You promised me, you will not forget, your promise is only one, if that promise is broken from you

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Alva

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Alva

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Alva

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We can't give up Alva to them

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So it's better if there is someone among us to disguise as Alva

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Who is this person?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Myself

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Who is it?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Who is handsome?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Hi

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Come on, let's gather

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 What's going on?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Why are we gathered here?

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I deliberately gathered you all

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I want to tell you, if professor Aldebaran is kidnapped by the evil spirits

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Kidnapped?

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 So we have to save the professor and we have to defeat the evil spirits

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But how?

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 The monster is strong, the professor is more powerful than the monster

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Calm down, I know how

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Actually, the one being targeted is Alva, not the professor

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So if we want our professor to be safe, we have to surrender Alva

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Let's go find Alva now

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Professor is safe

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Where are you?

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Alva

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Have you met Alva?

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Not yet, she's not in the library

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Where is she?

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Have you met Alva?

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 No, she's not in the library either

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Where is she?

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 She's not in the library either

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Where is Alva?

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Where is she?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Where is Alva?

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 We're looking for her

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 She was with us when we attacked the evil spirits, but now she's gone

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Maybe Alva is hiding

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Maybe she's running away

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Maybe she's in the library

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Alva is not like that

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Where is Alva?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 What should we use?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Let's use the kite

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 That's right, we should use the kite

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I'm going to find Alva

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Gawat, it's really you

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 What's wrong?

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Alva was kidnapped by the evil spirits

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 She's in the hallway

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Oh no

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 What should we do?

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 We're in trouble

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 What happened?

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Alva was kidnapped

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Let's go tell the professor

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Let's go

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I got you

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You're lying

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I'm going to find Alva

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I'm going to find Alva

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I'm going to find Alva

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I'm going to find Alva

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Alva

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Alva

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Alva

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Alva

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Alva

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Alva

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Alva

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Alva

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Alva

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Alva

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Alva

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Alva

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Alva

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Alva

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Alva

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Alva

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 I'm going to find the professor

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I won't let the evil spirits take the professor away

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I'm going to find the professor

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Professor Langni

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Professor Langni is not here

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Where is he?

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 He's in the hallway

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I'm scared

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He's not here

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Professor Purwocoki is not here either

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 What about him?

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Yasmin is not here either

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 What should we do?

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I'm scared

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 It's weird, how can they be together?

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 What are you doing here?

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 We're looking for Professor Agni

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Professor Agni and all teachers are on their way

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Where are they?

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 They're going to the place where the dark spirits help the professor

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 But we're asking for Alva

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Don't worry, be happy

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Megantarate is eager to be Alva

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 So they're going there with a fake Alva

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Isn't it amazing?

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 But it's even worse

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And then?

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 We should ask for help from others

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Let's go

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Oh my god, they're so childish

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Wait for me, don't go

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I have to defeat Barga before we get to the place where the dark spirits help

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 We're going to the dark spirit's house

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 We're going to the dark spirit's house

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000

 I'm going to find the weak point

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I'm going to find the weak point

360
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'm going to find the weak point

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I'm going to find the weak point

362
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I'm going to break it

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I'm going to break it

364
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I'm going to break it

365
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I'm going to break it

366
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I'm going to break it

367
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 My legs are aching

368
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I can't stand up

369
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 What should I do?

370
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 It's up to you

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 With your blood

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I can perfect your power

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Professor Aldi Baharan

374
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Where is he?

375
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Where is Professor Aldi?

376
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Shut up!

377
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Don't ask questions

378
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 How is it? Are we ready?

379
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Yes

380
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Now, let's go

381
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 How is it? Are we ready?

382
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Yes

383
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Now, let's go

384
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Let's go

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 We have to help Alva

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 One, two, three

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Let's go!

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 [The power of the universe]

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 [The power of the universe]

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 [The power of the universe]

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 What is it?

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 [The power of the universe]

393
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Brother!

394
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Brother, I can't stand it anymore!

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 I'm going to die!

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Brother!

397
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Hold on, sister!

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Thank you, Brita

399
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 You're welcome

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Alva!

401
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Hi, friends

402
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 How did you know I'm here?

403
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I'm here because you're flying!

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Yes, you're so used to it

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 You're making yourself a burden

406
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 You!

407
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Yes, sister

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 We're all worried

409
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Well, then

410
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 You have no other choice

411
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I'm the only one

412
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Who can help Professor Aldi Baharan

413
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 So, I'm chasing after him

414
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Thank you all

415
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 For helping me

416
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 I'm so proud of you

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But, Barga can't be defeated

418
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Alva, the ring!

419
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Barga's ring has a weakness

420
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 If he wears it, he'll be strong

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 So, the weakness is in the ring?

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 We'll make a plan

423
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 But, before that

424
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Catch him!

425
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 You have to eat first

426
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 If you eat, your energy will be full

427
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And your leg won't hurt anymore

428
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Okay

429
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 My leg doesn't hurt anymore!

430
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 You're right, sister!

431
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Let's make a plan!

432
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Alva, the ring!

433
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Why is it so dark?

434
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Alva

435
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I'm going to take your blood

436
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Okay

437
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Take the blood

438
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Take it

439
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Alva

440
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Why are you a murderer?

441
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I don't know

442
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Maybe he's very curious

443
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Because he's the only one who can help Professor Aldi Baharan

444
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Wear the ring

445
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Take the hair

446
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 If you want to take the blood

447
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Hurry up

448
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 You can wear the shawl

449
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 You're lazy

450
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Anggara

451
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 I think there's something wrong with Alva

452
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Maybe she's stressed

453
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 It doesn't matter what you do

454
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 It doesn't matter

455
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 What matters is your blood

456
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 With your blood

457
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 I can perfect my power

458
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Take the blood

459
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Take it

460
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Is that all?

461
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Have a good time, Alva

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Okay, Professor

463
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I'm going to take the blood

464
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 You got it

465
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 You're so weak

466
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I feel sorry for you

467
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Attack!

468
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Attack!

469
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I'm going to take the blood

470
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I'm going to take the blood

471
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Attack!

472
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Attack!

473
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Attack!

474
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Rita, that's his ring

475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Get closer

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Okay

477
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Attack!

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Attack!

479
00:25:47,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Attack!

480
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Attack!

481
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Attack!

482
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Alva, are you okay?

483
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I'm okay

484
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 My hand is so big

485
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 It's hard to get the ring

486
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 What should I do?

487
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I have an idea

488
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Get the oil

489
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I'm going to use it

490
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I hope it works

491
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Okay, guys

492
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Let's attack him

493
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Let's go

494
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Attack!

495
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Rita, get closer

496
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Okay

497
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Attack!

498
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Attack!

499
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Attack!

500
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'm going to take the blood

501
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Attack!

502
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Attack!

503
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Get the ring!

504
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Attack!

505
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 How is it, brother?

506
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 The blood is ready

507
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Good

508
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 With this blood

509
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 My knowledge will be perfect

510
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And I won't be defeated

511
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Hahaha

512
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I'm going to take the blood

513
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Anggar!

514
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Why don't you react to me?

515
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I don't know, sir

516
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Is it a misunderstanding?

517
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 I bought a meatball

518
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 I threw it wrong

519
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Why did you do that, Anggar?

520
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I was fooled

521
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 It's time

522
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I'm going to take care of the rest

523
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Let's go, Ma

524
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I want to go to Tara

525
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 You can use Tongsis

526
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Or you can use Tongsis

527
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 It's up to you

528
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 It's easy

529
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I'm going to use Tongsis

530
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 It's fast

531
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Let's go together

532
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Let's go together

533
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Let's go together

534
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Ouch! It hurts!

535
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Ouch! It hurts!

536
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Ouch! It hurts!

537
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Ouch! It hurts!

538
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 It's so hot

539
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 I'm hungry

540
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Let's go to the village

541
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Let's go

542
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Don't eat me

543
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I'm hungry

544
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Let's go

545
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 We have to be hungry

546
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Don't you know that?

547
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 I know

548
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I'm hungry

549
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But I don't want to eat you

550
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 You're so mean

551
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 But it's not a normal meatball

552
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 It's a meatball that has been castrated

553
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Don't you remember Professor Agni?

554
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Now we're going to learn about castration

555
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Which is a magic bean

556
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Now you have a bean in front of you

557
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 You plant it in the ground

558
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 But be careful

559
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Don't let it get wet

560
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Okay, ma'am

561
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 The bean is castrated

562
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Can I?

563
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Please help me, ma'am

564
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 You can't

565
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 I told you from the beginning

566
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 You can't let the bean get wet

567
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Now you'll see what happens

568
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Please help me, ma'am

569
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Remember

570
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Imagine

571
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 You want to eat this bean

572
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And if you eat it

573
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 You'll get a sting

574
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And you'll get a sting

575
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And you'll get a sting

576
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It's so fun

577
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I can't do it

578
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I don't want to do it anymore

579
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
