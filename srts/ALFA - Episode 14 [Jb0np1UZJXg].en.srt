00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 To be continued...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 To be continued...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 To be continued...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 To be continued...

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 To be continued...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, prepare it, friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I know everything, it turns out that you're evil

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You're friends with the person who kidnapped me in the cave, right?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Then you want to harm Fega and Alva, right?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I don't want to follow you

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So Fega succeeded in making the princess realize the meaning of love and sacrifice

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And finally all this madness ends

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 That's right, professor

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 That's the star

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I can't fail this time

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Thank you, it turns out that you've helped me

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Sorry, I misjudged you

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And I hit you too

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Yes, when you landed, they were fighting for your victory

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 When you landed, they were fighting for your victory

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So I took you away from there

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I don't want to hear your excuses anymore

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Why can you just let it go?

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I have to get that fallen star princess

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 The star that can be returned to the sky when the moon is full

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Oh, so the fallen star can return to the sky when the moon is full

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 The star that can be returned to the sky when the moon is full

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I think it's done

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 So until it's done, I have to protect Selena

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 What are you doing?

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Where are you going?

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Where are you going? You're in a hurry

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 I'm running in the morning

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 To be healthy, I'm going first

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Wait

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 What is it?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I want to tell you that today is my professor's class

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 But not in a normal class, but in a minaret

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 There's a white star there

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 It's scary, it can be found

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 What should I do?

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I'm going first, bye

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Alva

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 It's so weird

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 She's been like that since yesterday

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Maybe someone is jealous of her

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Selena, wake up

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Wake up

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Selena

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Wake up

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I'm sleepy, Alva

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I'm awake at night

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But when I'm awake, I have to sleep

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I understand

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 But there's a lesson here

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Come on, hurry up

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You have to move from here

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Professor, why is the lesson in the minaret?

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Why not in class?

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Why?

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Is there a problem?

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Alva

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 What are you doing here?

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Nothing, professor

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I was running in the morning

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I didn't mean to come here

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Kids

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Line up

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Go to the classroom

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Everyone

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Listen up

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 As usual

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I will teach you magic to defend yourself

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 The mantra we will learn today is

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 The magic of moving forward

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Professor Agni will help me

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Everyone, please pay attention

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 To the left

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Find the jewel

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Silence

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Professor Purwa

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I think you should tie your hair more often

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Silence

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Now I have changed into Professor Purwa

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Professor Purwa

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I think we should switch bodies

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Move forward

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 As you can see

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It's time to try

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 We will start with the turn

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Vega

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Tommy

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Move forward

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Remember the mantra

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And the name

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Move forward

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Yes, I did it!

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 It's so cool

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Vega's magic

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Good

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Tommy and Vega

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Let's continue

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I will try

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Alva

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Tole

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Move forward

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Okay

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Silence

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 What's that sound?

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It's not anyone's sound, Professor

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 It was

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 My voice, Professor

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I saw

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 The

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Tole fell

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 That's why I was like that

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Alva

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Alva

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Move forward

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Silence

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Good

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 The last lesson here

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Tomorrow we will start again

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Alva

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Tole

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Tomorrow is your turn

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And you have to do it

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 If you don't, you will be dismissed

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Yes, Professor

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Luckily Selena didn't know

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 If not

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Oh my

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I'm sure

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 The fallen star girl

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Must be in this school

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Yes

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I agree with you

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 We will find out

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Through them

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Hey!

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 What do you want?

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Don't

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Don't attack me

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Please

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Calm down

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 We won't hurt you

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Yes

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 We want to give you a present

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 A present?

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 What present?

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 We want to give you this

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Hey

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It's not that easy

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 If you want this girl

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 You have to follow our order

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 But don't make it hard

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yes, don't make it hard

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 It's easy

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Do you know about the fallen star?

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 No

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 That's your job

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Find out about the fallen star

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 If it's true

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 The fallen star is in this school

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Let us know

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And you

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Will get this diamond

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 As your reward

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 That was a cool shot

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 We got that

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Yes

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 But how do we find out about the fallen star?

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 I don't know

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Let's find out

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 It's not easy

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 The fallen star is in this school

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I have to get it first

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 From the elf warriors

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And give it to the dark lord

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 My sword!

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Oh no

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I can't use my power

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I might get hurt

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000

 it's Alva

393
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
 [music]

394
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 Alva, you must be sick

395
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 that's why you're angry

396
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 where are you taking me?

397
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
 I want to go back

398
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 [music]

399
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 Alva, you must be sick

400
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
 that's why you're angry

401
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,600
 we want to take you to the doctor

402
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 I'm not sick

403
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 let me go

404
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
 [music]

405
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
 I'm not Alva

406
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 do you know?

407
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 I'm not Alva

408
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 Alva, be patient

409
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
 we're almost there

410
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 let's go

411
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 [music]

412
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
 yes

413
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
 I know now

414
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
 the star will shine bright when it's happy

415
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
 and it will fade when it's sad

416
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
 the star likes to dance and sing

417
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,600
 if I can make it dance and sing

418
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 it will be happy

419
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 and its body will shine

420
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 [laughing]

421
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
 yes

422
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
 this time I will succeed

423
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 [music]

424
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
 where am I?

425
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 [music]

426
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
 it's terrible

427
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 [music]

428
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
 I'm still in Putri Selena's body

429
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
 [music]

430
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 Putri Selena must be in my body

431
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
 [music]

432
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
 she must be afraid

433
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
 I have to go back to school

434
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:13,600
 [music]

435
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
 oh no

436
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
 the key again

437
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
 [music]

438
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
 there's a window

439
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 [music]

440
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 no

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
 [music]

442
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
 oh no

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 [music]

444
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
 oh no

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
 [music]

446
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
 why don't I have a tongs?

447
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 [music]

448
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 where is it?

449
00:27:44,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 [music]

450
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
 what is that?

451
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:15,600
 [music]

452
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 why is it me?

453
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
 sorry

454
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
 everything is okay

455
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
 no problem

456
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
 no problem

457
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
 it's very good

458
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 so I'm just fine

459
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
 thank you

460
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 thank you doctor

461
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
 okay, welcome beautiful

462
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,600
 Alva, don't get sick

463
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
 tomorrow is the full moon

464
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 the magenta said to me

465
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
 if it's the full moon later

466
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 we will play

467
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
 that's right

468
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
 oh no

469
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 tomorrow night is the full moon

470
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 I have to get my body back

471
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,600
 if I don't get my body back

472
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 I won't be able to go back to space

473
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,600
 I have to wait for the full moon next month

474
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
 okay Alva

475
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
 I will give you

476
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
 a calm down mantra

477
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 a calm down mantra

478
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
 so you won't be angry anymore

479
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 so you can sleep well tomorrow

480
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 we can play

481
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
 it's so fun

482
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
 I don't want to

483
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 no no no

484
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 Alva, don't be naughty

485
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
 this mantra is not dangerous

486
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
 not dangerous

487
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 it can only make you sleepy

488
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 and sleeping handsome

489
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
 until tomorrow

490
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
 okay Alva

491
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 it's so bad

492
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
 I can't sleep

493
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
 I have to find my body

494
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
 I don't want to be late

495
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
 to go back to space

496
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
 just lie down

497
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
 that's right baby

498
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
 okay Alva

499
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
 ready?

500
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 are you ready?

501
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 no no no

502
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
 Alva

503
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
 Alva

504
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
 Alva is so naughty

505
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
 why?

506
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
 why?

507
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
 why is she so weird?

508
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 why?

509
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
 I think she's confused

510
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
 let's go

511
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
 thank you Dastin

512
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
 oh my god

513
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
 why is she so weird?

514
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,600
 guys

515
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
 please help me

516
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
 I have to go back to school

517
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
 please help me

518
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 get me out of here

519
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 why can't they hear me?

520
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 I think they're hypnotized

521
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 I have an idea

522
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 this is the key

523
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 this is the key

524
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
 this is the key

525
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 this is the key

526
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:20,600
 I have to go back to school

527
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 I have to go back to school

528
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
 I have to go back to school

529
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 I have to go back to school

530
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,600
 I have to find the real Selena's body

531
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:46,600
 wait

532
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 Gawat

533
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 there's a space professor

534
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
 is the star already shining?

535
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 good

536
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:15,600
 but

537
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,600
 if that's the professor

538
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,600
 why can she go out by herself?

539
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
 I hypnotized them

540
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,600
 so they can dance and sing

541
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
 good

542
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
 she's dancing and singing

543
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 she must be happy

544
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:04,600
 but

545
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
 why isn't she shining?

546
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
 you

547
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
 you're not the star

548
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
 where's the star?

549
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:23,600
 you

550
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,600
 how dare you to play with me

551
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
 our guess is right

552
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
 I think she's Selena's friend

553
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
 I like her

554
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
 I like her

555
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
 I like her

556
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 she's Selena's friend

557
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
 we should give her the star

558
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
 let's go after her

559
00:33:41,600 --> 00:34:03,600
 what?

560
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
 help

561
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,600
 I'm tired

562
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:30,600
 why am I running?

563
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
 Rita, help me

564
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
 I'm not Alva

565
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
 help me

566
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
 you're not Alva?

567
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,600
 if you're not Alva, who are you?

568
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
 I'm her star

569
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
 you believe me, right?

570
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
 I don't believe you

571
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
 no

572
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
 let me go

573
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
 let me go

574
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
 I'm the star

575
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
 star?

576
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
 yes

577
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
 you're good kids

578
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
 now

579
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
 let me go

580
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
 I have to find out where my body is

581
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
 there

582
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 the star

583
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
 let's go back

584
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
 this way

585
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
 yes

586
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
 you're the star?

587
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 impossible

588
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
 the soldier said

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
 it's rare to find a star

590
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
 that's right

591
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
 if you don't believe me

592
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
 ask Rita

593
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,600
 I met her yesterday

594
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,600
 Rita, you're the star?

595
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
 the star that lives in the school tower

596
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
 she helped me yesterday

597
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
 no

598
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
 you're the star

00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
 I don't believe you

600
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
 you're Alva

601
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
 I'm Selena

602
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 you're Rita

603
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
 I don't know

604
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
 I'm in Alva's body

605
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
 maybe

606
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
 you're Alva's body

607
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
 I don't know

608
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
 when I jumped to the tower

609
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
 I fainted

610
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
 when I realized

611
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
 I was trapped in Alva's body

612
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,600
 Alva's body

613
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
 the star fell

614
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
 where is it?

615
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
 I know how to find Vega

616
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
 if he's the star

617
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 I'll ask him to shine

618
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
 that's right

619
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
 okay

620
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
 I'll do it

621
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600

622
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600

 he shines

629
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
 it means

630
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 he's Selena

 I'm Selena

 we're right

 Alva's body is Selena's body

640
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
 what should we do?

641
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
 let's just follow him

642
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600

 Alva is being chased by the robber

 what should we do?

646
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600

 You've helped me.

 Star Princess is very weak and hot.

00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
 you should listen.

786
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,500
 He said,

787
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,500
 the fallen star is taken because of what?

788
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,500
 Because of hair, eyes, and heart,

789
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
 it can make a great power.

790
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
 Yes, it's true.

791
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
 It's dangerous if it falls into the hands of the evil spy.

792
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
 But we can't do it ourselves.

793
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
 We need the help of Professor Aldebaran.

794
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
 Okay.

795
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
 Let's go.

796
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,500
 So it's true.

797
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
 The fallen star is in our school.

798
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
 Yes, sir.

799
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,500
 I asked her to stay at the school tower.

800
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
 But because of Professor Angkara,

801
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
 she was kidnapped.

802
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,500
 Why are you hiding this from me, Alva?

803
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
 Your actions can be dangerous for yourself

804
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
 and your other friends.

805
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,500
 I'm sorry, Professor.

806
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
 Because the fallen star told me

807
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
 that I can't tell anyone.

808
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,500
 So I have to keep my promise.

809
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,500
 If so,

810
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
 we have to find out

811
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,500
 where they took the fallen star.

812
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
 Use this telescope, Professor.

813
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:52,500
 It's morning already.

814
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
 I'm so tired.

815
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
 I'm sleepy.

816
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
 Now is the time.

817
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
 Soon,

818
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
 all the power of the fallen star

819
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,500
 will belong to the Dark Lord.

820
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
 Even if it's Aldebaran,

821
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
 he won't be able to stop it.

822
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
 [laughing]

823
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,500
 [laughing]

824
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:49,500
 We have to go there

825
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
 before Angkara takes the power of the fallen star.

826
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,500
 I'll go with you.

827
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
 I'll go with you.

828
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
 There's a fruit

829
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
 and a curse.

830
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
 This is dangerous.

831
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
 You can't go with us.

832
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,500
 But, soldier,

833
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
 I have to take responsibility for this.

834
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,500
 Besides,

835
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
 I promised the fallen star

836
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
 that I would help her

837
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
 until she returns to the sky.

838
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
 Alright, Alva.

839
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
 You can go with us.

840
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
 Thank you, Professor.

841
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
 What do we do now, Professor?

842
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
 Yes, what do we do?

843
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
 Don't you forget.

844
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,500
 There's a very important task

845
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,500
 for you.

846
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
 What is it, soldier?

847
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500

857
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,500
 Are you ready, Angkara?

858
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
 Yes, sir.

859
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:56,500
 You go out, Angkara.

860
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
 There's a guest waiting for you.

861
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
 [sigh]

862
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
 They again.

863
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
 I won't give you a chance to break up, sir.

864
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:13,500
 [grunt]

865
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:27,500
 Face them, Angkara.

866
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,500
 [music]

867
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,500
 Yes, sir.

868
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
 I will fight them for you.

869
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:43,500

872
00:51:52,500 --> 00:52:03,500
 Good morning, Alvar.

873
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
 Megatara.

874
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,500
 And also, you, Alva.

875
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:18,500
 Bring back the star princess.

876
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
 Oh.

877
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
 It's not that easy, Alva.

878
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
 And I'm begging you.

879
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
 Don't ever bother me again.

880
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:34,500
 [music]

881
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,500
 They're together.

882
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
 Let me face them.

883
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
 Alvar, go.

884
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,500
 [music]

885
00:52:46,500 --> 00:53:02,500
 Finally.

886
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
 The star princess's hair is falling off.

887
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,500
 [laugh]

888
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500

 The star princess's hair is falling off.

892
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
 It will make me head to your weapon.

893
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,500
 [laugh]

894
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:36,500

00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:15,500
 Sir.

901
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:23,500
 Sir.

902
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,500
 [music]

903
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
 Sir.

 [music]

905
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:58,500
 How can I not get hit by this?

906
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500

907
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:17,500

 Finally.

924
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
 The star princess's hair is falling off.

 Now it's my turn.

928
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,500
 To take the white tears from you.

929
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:26,500

 With tears of tears.

938
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
 God's power will soon recover.

939
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,500
 [laugh]

940
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,500
 Now it's time for me to take...

941
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
 ...the heart of the star princess.

948
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:58,500
 I have to tear the star princess's eyes and hair now.

949
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,500
 After that, I will become a force.

950

 [music]

951
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,500
 You have to stop her.

952
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,500
 Don't let her drink the tears that have been mixed with my hair.

953
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,500
 Because it can cure all her diseases.

954
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,500
 And she will be stronger.
