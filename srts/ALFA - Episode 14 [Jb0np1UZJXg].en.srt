1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, prepare it, friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I know everything, it turns out that you're evil

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're friends with the person who kidnapped me in the cave, right?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then you want to harm Fega and Alva, right?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't want to follow you

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So Fega succeeded in making the princess realize the meaning of love and sacrifice

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And finally all this madness ends

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's right, professor

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's the star

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can't fail this time

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you, it turns out that you've helped me

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sorry, I misjudged you

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I hit you too

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, when you landed, they were fighting for your victory

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When you landed, they were fighting for your victory

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So I took you away from there

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't want to hear your excuses anymore

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why can you just let it go?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have to get that fallen star princess

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The star that can be returned to the sky when the moon is full

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, so the fallen star can return to the sky when the moon is full

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The star that can be returned to the sky when the moon is full

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think it's done

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So until it's done, I have to protect Selena

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you doing?

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Where are you going?

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Where are you going? You're in a hurry

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm running in the morning

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
To be healthy, I'm going first

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wait

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What is it?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to tell you that today is my professor's class

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But not in a normal class, but in a minaret

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's a white star there

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's scary, it can be found

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What should I do?

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm going first, bye

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Alva

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's so weird

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She's been like that since yesterday

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Maybe someone is jealous of her

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Selena, wake up

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wake up

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Selena

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Wake up

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sleepy, Alva

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm awake at night

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But when I'm awake, I have to sleep

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I understand

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But there's a lesson here

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on, hurry up

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to move from here

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Professor, why is the lesson in the minaret?

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why not in class?

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why?

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Is there a problem?

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alva

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you doing here?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nothing, professor

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was running in the morning

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't mean to come here

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Kids

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Line up

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go to the classroom

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Everyone

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Listen up

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
As usual

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I will teach you magic to defend yourself

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The mantra we will learn today is

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The magic of moving forward

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Professor Agni will help me

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone, please pay attention

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
To the left

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Find the jewel

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Silence

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Professor Purwa

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think you should tie your hair more often

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Silence

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now I have changed into Professor Purwa

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Professor Purwa

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think we should switch bodies

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Move forward

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:46,000
As you can see

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's time to try

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We will start with the turn

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Vega

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Tommy

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Move forward

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Remember the mantra

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And the name

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Move forward

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes, I did it!

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's so cool

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Vega's magic

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Good

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Tommy and Vega

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's continue

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will try

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Alva

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Tole

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Move forward

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Silence

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's that sound?

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's not anyone's sound, Professor

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It was

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My voice, Professor

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I saw

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Tole fell

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's why I was like that

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Alva

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Move forward

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Silence

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Good

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The last lesson here

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Tomorrow we will start again

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Alva

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Tole

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Tomorrow is your turn

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And you have to do it

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If you don't, you will be dismissed

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes, Professor

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Luckily Selena didn't know

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If not

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh my

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sure

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The fallen star girl

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Must be in this school

141
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I agree with you

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We will find out

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Through them

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hey!

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What do you want?

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't attack me

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Please

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Calm down

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We won't hurt you

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We want to give you a present

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A present?

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What present?

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We want to give you this

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hey

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not that easy

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you want this girl

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You have to follow our order

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But don't make it hard

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes, don't make it hard

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's easy

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you know about the fallen star?

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's your job

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Find out about the fallen star

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If it's true

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The fallen star is in this school

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let us know

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And you

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Will get this diamond

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
As your reward

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That was a cool shot

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We got that

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But how do we find out about the fallen star?

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's find out

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's not easy

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The fallen star is in this school

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have to get it first

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
From the elf warriors

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And give it to the dark lord

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My sword!

186
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh no

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't use my power

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I might get hurt

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What's that?

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is my sleep powder

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to sleep

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The fallen star is in this school

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:17,600
[music]

194
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
[thunder]

195
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
help! help!

196
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600

that I'm Putri Bintang Jatuh

206
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
because only you and Alva know

207
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,600

209
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,600

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
there must be someone hiding this from her

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
do you know?

393
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm not Alva

394
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Alva, be patient

395
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
we're almost there

396
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
let's go

397
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:23,600
[music]

398
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
yes

399
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
I know now

400
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
the star will shine bright when it's happy

401
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
and it will fade when it's sad

402
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
the star likes to dance and sing

403
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,600
if I can make it dance and sing

404
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
it will be happy

405
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
and its body will shine

406
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,600
[laughing]

407
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
yes

408
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
this time I will succeed

409
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:19,600
[music]

410
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
where am I?

411
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:35,600
[music]

412
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
it's terrible

413
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,600
[music]

414
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I'm still in Putri Selena's body

415
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
[music]

416
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Putri Selena must be in my body

417
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
[music]

418
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
she must be afraid

419
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
I have to go back to school

420
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:13,600
[music]

421
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
oh no

422
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
the key again

423
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
[music]

424
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
there's a window

425
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,600
[music]

426
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
no

427
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
[music]

428
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
oh no

429
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
[music]

430
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
oh no

431
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
[music]

432
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
why don't I have a tongs?

433
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
[music]

434
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
where is it?

435
00:27:44,600 --> 00:28:02,600
[music]

436
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
what is that?

437
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:15,600
[music]

438
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
why is it me?

439
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
sorry

440
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
everything is okay

441
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
no problem

442
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
it's very good

443
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
so I'm just fine

444
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
thank you

445
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
thank you doctor

446
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
okay, welcome beautiful

447
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Alva, don't get sick

448
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
tomorrow is the full moon

449
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
the magenta said to me

450
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
if it's the full moon later

451
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
we will play

452
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
that's right

453
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
oh no

454
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
tomorrow night is the full moon

455
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I have to get my body back

456
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,600
if I don't get my body back

457
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
I won't be able to go back to space

458
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I have to wait for the full moon next month

459
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
okay Alva

460
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I will give you

461
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,600
a calm down mantra

462
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
so you won't be angry anymore

463
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
so you can sleep well tomorrow

464
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
we can play

465
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
it's so fun

466
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
I don't want to

467
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
no no no

468
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Alva, don't be naughty

469
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
this mantra is not dangerous

470
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
not dangerous

471
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
it can only make you sleepy

472
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
and sleeping handsome

473
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
until tomorrow

474
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
okay Alva

475
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
it's so bad

476
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
I can't sleep

477
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
I have to find my body

478
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I don't want to be late

479
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
to go back to space

480
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
just lie down

481
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
that's right baby

482
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
okay Alva

483
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
ready?

484
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
are you ready?

485
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
no no no

486
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Alva

487
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Alva is so naughty

488
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
why?

489
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
why is she so weird?

490
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
why?

491
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I think she's confused

492
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
let's go

493
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
thank you Dastin

494
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
oh my god

495
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
why is she so weird?

496
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,600
guys

497
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
please help me

498
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I have to go back to school

499
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
please help me

500
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
get me out of here

501
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
why can't they hear me?

502
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,600
I think they're hypnotized

503
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I have an idea

504
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:57,600
this is the key

505
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:27,600
I have to go back to school

506
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,600
I have to find the real Selena's body

507
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:46,600
wait

508
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Gawat

509
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
there's a space professor

510
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
is the star already shining?

511
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:02,600
good

512
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:15,600
but

513
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,600
if that's the professor

514
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,600
why can she go out by herself?

515
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
I hypnotized them

516
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,600
so they can dance and sing

517
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
good

518
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
she's dancing and singing

519
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
she must be happy

520
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:04,600
but

521
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
why isn't she shining?

522
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
you

523
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
you're not the star

524
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
where's the star?

525
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:23,600
you

526
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,600
how dare you to play with me

527
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
our guess is right

528
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
I think she's Selena's friend

529
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,600
I like her

530
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
she's Selena's friend

531
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
we should give her the star

532
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
let's go after her

533
00:33:41,600 --> 00:34:03,600
what?

534
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
help

535
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,600
I'm tired

536
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:30,600
why am I running?

537
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Rita, help me

538
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm not Alva

539
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
help me

540
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
you're not Alva?

541
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,600
if you're not Alva, who are you?

542
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I'm her star

543
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
you believe me, right?

544
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
I don't believe you

545
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
no

546
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,600
let me go

547
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
I'm the star

548
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
star?

549
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
yes

550
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
you're good kids

551
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
now

552
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
let me go

553
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
I have to find out where my body is

554
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
there

555
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
the star

556
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
let's go back

557
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
this way

558
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
yes

559
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
you're the star?

560
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
impossible

561
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
the soldier said

562
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
it's rare to find a star

563
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
that's right

564
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
if you don't believe me

565
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
ask Rita

566
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,600
I met her yesterday

567
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Rita, you're the star?

568
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
the star that lives in the school tower

569
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
she helped me yesterday

570
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
no

571
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
you're the star

572
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
I don't believe you

573
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
you're Alva

574
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
I'm Selena

575
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
you're Rita

576
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I don't know

577
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I'm in Alva's body

578
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
maybe

579
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
you're Alva's body

580
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I don't know

581
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
when I jumped to the tower

582
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
I fainted

583
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
when I realized

584
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
I was trapped in Alva's body

585
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Alva's body

586
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
the star fell

587
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
where is it?

588
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I know how to find Vega

589
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
if he's the star

590
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I'll ask him to shine

591
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
that's right

592
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
okay

593
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
I'll do it

594
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:35,600
shine

595
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,600
it's true

596
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
he shines

597
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
it means

598
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
he's Selena

599
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
see

600
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
I told you

601
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
I'm Selena

602
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
the star fell

603
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
if he's not Alva

604
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
what does it mean?

605
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Selena's body

606
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:09,600
we're right

607
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Alva's body is Selena's body

608
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
what should we do?

609
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
let's just follow him

610
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
let me see

611
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
let's go

612
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Alva is being chased by the robber

613
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
what should we do?

614
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
let's help Alva

615
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
okay

616
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
let's go

617
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I must be able to get out of the city

618
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
but

619
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
what should we do?

620
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:10,600
what if we can't help him?

621
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
what are you doing?

622
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
hurry up, we're late

623
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:25,600
hey, where are you going?

624
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
where are you going?

625
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,600
hey, where are you going?

626
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:57,600
let's go

627
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
calm down

628
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
it's us

629
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Vega?

630
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Rey?

631
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Lita?

632
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
why are you guys here?

633
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
how do you know me?

634
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Rey, of course we know you

635
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
he's Alva's soul

636
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
but I still don't believe you

637
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,600
why is my dress different?

638
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
where did you put my dress?

639
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm sorry

640
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I changed my dress there

641
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
but your dress is left behind

642
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
I'm sorry

643
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
let's talk later

644
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,600
now, you guys face each other

645
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
and then you guys change your soul

646
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
give me the cane

647
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
here's your cane

648
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
thank you

649
00:40:49,600 --> 00:41:17,600
soul change

650
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,600
go!

00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:32,600

You did it!

655
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,640
Thank you, Vega.

656
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,180
Mei, Frita,

657
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,220
welcome back my friends.

658
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,220
Now, you're back to your body, right?

659
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,820
Star Princess.

660
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,940
Yes, I'm back to my real body.

661
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,060
Thank you.

662
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,540
You're so kind to me.

663
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,980
You've helped me.

664
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,940
So now, I just need to find a new place

665
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,060
so I can fly to the sky.

666
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,180
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

667
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,660
So, you can go back to your original place.

668
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,860
I can't meet Selena anymore.

669
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,700
Don't worry.

670
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Later, I'll call you from the sky.

671
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
We can play together again.

672
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
Promise?

673
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700

Who's that?

00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
I'm being followed.

00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
I don't know.

Who's that?

00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Sir,

709
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Star Princess is very weak and hot.

710
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
I can't tie her.

711
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Even if I tie her, she'll be burned.

712
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Don't fight, Angkara.

713
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Because the peak of Star Princess's power is at night.

714
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
You can be burned by the light.

715
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
So?

716
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
We'll wait until tomorrow.

717
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Tomorrow morning,

718
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,500
I'll get Star Princess's power.

719
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,500
And with that power, I'll defeat Aldebaran.

720
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
Then,

721
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,500
I'll take the chosen child from Aldebaran's protection.

00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500

726
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
Princess Selena!

00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Where are you?

728
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,500
She must be taken by Professor Angkara.

729
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Oh my God.

730
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
Her heart must be taken.

731
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Yes.

732
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Oh, Reimu.

733
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,500
If the army is explaining the history of magic,

734
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
you should listen.

735
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,500
He said,

736
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,500
the fallen star is taken because of what?

737
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Because of hair, eyes, and heart,

738
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
it can make a great power.

739
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Yes, it's true.

740
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
It's dangerous if it falls into the hands of the evil spy.

741
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
But we can't do it ourselves.

742
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
We need the help of Professor Aldebaran.

743
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Okay.

744
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
Let's go.

745
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,500
So it's true.

746
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
The fallen star is in our school.

747
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Yes, sir.

748
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,500
I asked her to stay at the school tower.

749
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
But because of Professor Angkara,

750
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
she was kidnapped.

751
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Why are you hiding this from me, Alva?

752
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Your actions can be dangerous for yourself

753
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
and your other friends.

754
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,500
I'm sorry, Professor.

755
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Because the fallen star told me

756
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
that I can't tell anyone.

757
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,500
So I have to keep my promise.

758
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,500
If so,

759
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
we have to find out

760
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,500
where they took the fallen star.

761
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Use this telescope, Professor.

762
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:52,500
It's morning already.

763
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
I'm so tired.

764
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
I'm sleepy.

765
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Now is the time.

766
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
Soon,

767
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
all the power of the fallen star

768
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,500
will belong to the Dark Lord.

769
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Even if it's Aldebaran,

770
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
he won't be able to stop it.

771
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,500
[laughing]

772
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:49,500
We have to go there

773
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
before Angkara takes the power of the fallen star.

774
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
I'll go with you.

775
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
There's a fruit

776
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
and a curse.

777
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
This is dangerous.

778
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
You can't go with us.

779
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,500
But, soldier,

780
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
I have to take responsibility for this.

781
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Besides,

782
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
I promised the fallen star

783
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
that I would help her

784
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
until she returns to the sky.

785
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Alright, Alva.

786
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
You can go with us.

787
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Thank you, Professor.

788
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
What do we do now, Professor?

789
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Yes, what do we do?

790
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Don't you forget.

791
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,500
There's a very important task

792
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,500
for you.

793
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
What is it, soldier?

794
00:49:32,500 --> 00:50:32,500
[music]

795
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,500
Are you ready, Angkara?

796
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Yes, sir.

797
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:56,500
You go out, Angkara.

798
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
There's a guest waiting for you.

799
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
[sigh]

800
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
They again.

801
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
I won't give you a chance to break up, sir.

802
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:13,500
[grunt]

803
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Face them, Angkara.

804
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,500
[music]

805
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Yes, sir.

806
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
I will fight them for you.

807
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:52,500
[music]

808
00:51:52,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Good morning, Alvar.

809
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Megatara.

810
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,500
And also, you, Alva.

811
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Bring back the star princess.

812
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Oh.

813
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
It's not that easy, Alva.

814
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
And I'm begging you.

815
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
Don't ever bother me again.

816
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:34,500
[music]

817
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,500
They're together.

818
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Let me face them.

819
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Alvar, go.

820
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,500
[music]

821
00:52:46,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Finally.

822
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
The star princess's hair is falling off.

823
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,500
[laugh]

824
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:19,500
[music]

825
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:24,500
The star princess's hair is falling off.

826
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
It will make me head to your weapon.

827
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,500
[laugh]

828
00:53:30,500 --> 00:54:07,500
[music]

829
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:23,500
Sir.

830
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,500
[music]

831
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Sir.

832
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
[music]

833
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:58,500
How can I not get hit by this?

834
00:55:02,500 --> 00:56:53,500
[music]

835
00:56:53,500 --> 00:57:01,500
[laugh]

836
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Finally.

837
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
The star princess's hair is falling off.

838
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,500
[laugh]

839
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
[music]

840
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
Now it's my turn.

841
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,500
To take the white tears from you.

842
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:26,500
[music]

843
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
[laugh]

844
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:37,500
Tear of tears.

845
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:51,500
[music]

846
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,500
[laugh]

847
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,500
With tears of tears.

848
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
God's power will soon recover.

849
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,500
[laugh]

850
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Now it's time for me to take...

851
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
...the heart of the star princess.

852
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:36,500
[music]

853
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:44,500
Duplicate!

854
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:58,500
I have to tear the star princess's eyes and hair now.

855
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,500
After that, I will become a force.

856
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
[music]

857
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,500
You have to stop her.

858
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,500
Don't let her drink the tears that have been mixed with my hair.

859
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,500
Because it can cure all her diseases.

860
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,500
And she will be stronger.

861
00:59:17,500 --> 01:00:13,500
