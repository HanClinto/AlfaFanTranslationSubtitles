00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
 It's easy

195
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 Maybe this one, sir

196
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 Maybe this one

197
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 You're so annoying

198
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,320
 Nothing happened

199
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
 So this one is the one

200
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,320
 That's wrong!

201
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
 Find another one

202
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
 This one, sir

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
 Hey!

204
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:01,320
 That's wrong!

205
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
 That's wrong!

206
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 Maybe she found Tongsis

207
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 Tongsis is amazing

208
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 Only old people in the world can do that

209
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:40,320
 Sir!

210
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
 I found it!

211
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 Wow!

212
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
 Cool!

213
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 How's it, Alva?

214
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 Did you find Tongsis?

215
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 Yes, sir!

216
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 Good!

217
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,320
 You should get what you should get

218
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 Look!

219
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
 Follow me!

220
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:25,320
 Ready?

221
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
 One, two, three!

 It's here!

233
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
 Yes, it's here

234
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,320
 Over there

235
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
 There's a special door

236
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
 To the school

237
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 Okay?

238
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
 Only people like you, Alva

239
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 Can enter that special door

240
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,320
 Now, find a boat

241
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
 That can jump into the water

242
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
 A boat that can jump into the water?

243
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 Where is it?

244
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
 You're so stubborn

245
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
 You should try first

246
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
 Okay?

247
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:08,320
 Alva!

248
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,320
 This is for you

249
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,320
 To be continued...

250
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:30,320
 The army is coming!

251
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,320
 Army!

252
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
 Army!

253
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
 Army!

254
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,320
 To be continued...

255
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,320
 That's the army

256
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:57,320
 Sorry, sorry

257
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
 It's okay

258
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
 You have a pen too

259
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
 So, you're from Siir School, right?

260
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 Yes

261
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 You too?

262
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
 Yes

263
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 I have a friend

264
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
 I'm Rey

265
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 I'm Alva

266
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
 Let's go in

267
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
 Let's go

268
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
 Wait, wait

269
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
 What is this log?

270
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
 I don't know

271
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
 What is this log for?

272
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 Okay, let's go

273
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
 You!

274
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
 That's for special kids

275
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
 Not like you

276
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,320
 You don't have a seat

277
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320

 We have a special kid now!

282
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
 Which one?

283
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
 Just wait

284
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 We're going to die!

285
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
 No!

286
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 Don't go!

287
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 Alva!

288
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320

 The river is wet

304
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 Yeah

305
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
 Yeah

306
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
 It's going to be cold soon

307
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
 How do you know?

308
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
 Have you been here before?

309
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
 Not yet

310
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
 Just this time

311
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
 Do you know where it is?

312
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
 I don't know

313
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
 Now, we have to find our treasure

314
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 If you're smart, you should know where we should look for it

315
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 It must be around here

316
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:23,320
 Where do we look for it?

317
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
 Just let it flow

318
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
 Look for it one by one

319
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,320
 Okay

320
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
 Just follow him

321
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 Maybe he's right

322
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 Okay

323
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 I'm left behind

324
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
 Where is it?

325
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
 I'm left behind

326
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
 Where is it?

327
00:21:45,320 --> 00:22:01,320
 It must be here

328
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
 Where is it?

329
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:14,320
 That's the balloon

330
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
 My name is written there

331
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 Maybe that's it

332
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 That's so cool

333
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
 Awesome

 That's him

335
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
 He has my name

336
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:45,320
 That's so cool

337
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 What?

338
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,320
 This place is cool

339
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
 There are bubbles

340
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
 Yeah

341
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 Bubbles

342
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
 That's so cool

343
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 I'm being followed

344
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
 What?

345
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 You're being followed

346
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 No, no, no

347
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,320
 Don't touch me, just let me be

348
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
 Come on

349
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 Why did you disappear?

350
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
 That was fun, right?

351
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 Yeah

352
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
 Oh no

353
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 What are you doing?

354
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
 We're going to school

355
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 Oh yeah

356
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 I forgot

357
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 Let's go

358
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
 Come on

359
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
 Stop

360
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 Where are we going?

361
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
 There?

362
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 There?

363
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
 I think

364
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 There

365
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 Let's go

366
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 Let's go

367
00:23:43,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 Come on, hurry

368
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 That's so cool

369
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
 Yeah, the school

370
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 Let's go in

371
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 Come on

372
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,320
 Good afternoon, kids

373
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
 Why is the hat so cheap?

374
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
 I don't know

375
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
 It's so cool

376
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,320
 We can do it

377
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:57,320
 We can do it

378
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,320
 We can do it

379
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 What are we doing, Sega?

380
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320

00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,740
 You'll be scolded by the professor.

 I just want to go to the pool.

00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,740
 Yes, where's Alva?

00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,740
 I don't know.

602
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,740

 Alva, how can you throw this?

 You don't wear a helmet.

639
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,740
 I don't know.

640
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,740
 Alva was smart.

641
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,740
 We're all smart.

642
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,740

00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,740
 Don't fight.

644
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,740
 Do you know what I saw?

645
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,740
 What did you see?

646
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,740
 I saw...

647
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,740
 That's it.

648
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,740
 She didn't see anything.

649
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,740
 I'm going there.

650
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,740
 Come on.

651
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,740
 Wait.

652
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,740
 Where are you going?

653
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,740
 Don't be a man.

654
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,740
 You can't come with us.

655
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,740
 Come on.

656
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:53,740
 Why are you so mean to Vega?

657
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,740
 Just ignore him.

658
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,740
 He's so smart.

659
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,740
 I'm tired of him.

660
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,740
 What did you see in that room?

661
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,740
 I saw a three-headed dragon.

662
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,740
 What?

663
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,740
 Be quiet.

664
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,740
 Slowly.

665
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,740
 How come?

666
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,740
 I don't know.

667
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,740
 I'm scared.

668
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:28,740
 Wait.

669
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,740
 Alva.

670
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,740
 Do you know there's a three-headed dragon in this school?

671
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,740
 Of course I know.

672
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,740
 It's my pet.

673
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,740
 What?

674
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,740
 No.

675
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,740
 Alva.

676
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,740
 How do you know...

677
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,740
 ...there's a three-headed dragon?

678
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,740
 It means...

679
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,740
 You.

680
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,740
 Yes, but I didn't mean to go in that secret room.

681
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:11,740
 But why is there a three-headed dragon?

682
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,740
 Enough.

683
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,740
 Now, go back to the classroom.

684
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,740
 But, Tender.

685
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,740
 That way.

686
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,740
 I want all the doors and windows closed.

687
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,740
 And tell everyone.

688
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,740
 Prof.

689
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,740
 We have a problem.

690
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,740
 Yes, I know.

691
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,740
 Do it now.

692
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:46,740
 Prof.

693
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,740
 I know Alva.

694
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,740
 But, I don't know where she is.

695
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,740
 I know.

696
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,740
 Alva went into the secret room.

697
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,740
 And met the three-headed dragon.

698
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,740
 What we fear...

699
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,740
 ...will happen.

700
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,740
 Run!

701
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,740
 Run!

702
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,740
 Run!

703
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,740
 I am...

704
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,740
 ...Barga.

705
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,740
 Run!

706
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:52,740
 Barga is a very strong monster.

707
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,740
 He is the arm of the 8th prince.

708
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,740
 The only one who can defeat him...

709
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,740
 ...is the 8th prince...

710
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,740
 ...and his son.

711
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,740
 Run!

712
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:11,740
 Help!

713
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,740
 To be continued...

714
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,740
 Show your spirit, get ready...

715
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,740
 ...my friend.

716
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,740
 Run, jump, and conquer...

717
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,740
 ...the stars.

718
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:36,740
 Be brave, don't give up.

719
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:43,740
 Chase your dreams and hopes.

720
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,740
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams.

721
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,740

722
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:57,740
 Go, go, go, fight with all your heart.

723
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,740
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud.

724
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,740
 Go, go, go, let's dream.

725
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,740
 Go, go, go, we are sure.
