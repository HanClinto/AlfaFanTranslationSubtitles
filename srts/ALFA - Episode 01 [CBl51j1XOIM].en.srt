Show your spirit, get your friends ready

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Run, jump, jump, conquer the stars

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We can do it

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Good afternoon

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you know why I called you here?

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, I know

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Soon, Usianya will be 7 years old

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And he is not safe in this house

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know what to do

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We will take him to the hospital

[Alarm ringing]

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My name is...

21
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I was accepted in a magic school

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Sir!

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What?

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I was accepted in a magic school

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The letter said I can go to a magic school

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You are great, Alfa

27
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wait a minute

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mommy!

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes, Pi?

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Alfa was accepted in a magic school

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you want to go to school?

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes, I do!

33
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Pi, so you mean you want to take him to school?

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Then?

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's in the toilet

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Alfa!

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've been taking care of you since you were a kid

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I've fed you

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now you want to go to school?

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And you think I want to pay for your school?

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't think you can get out of this house

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Especially for school

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Throw it away

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He's coming

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mi!

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's wrong, Pi?

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's coming, Mi!

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Pi!

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's wrong, Pi?

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Close the door!

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Pi!

Pi

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How could this happen?

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't know, Mi

56

[Singing Happy Birthday]

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How did it happen?

58
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's see

59
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Good afternoon

60
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Is there anything I can help you with?

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes

62
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let me introduce myself, I'm Megantara

63
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm here to pick up Alfa

64
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Alfa?

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Where are you taking Alfa?

66
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wait, where are you from?

67
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm from a magic school

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, so you're the one from the magic school

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, that's right

70
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So, let me take Alfa

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who?

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Not anyone, Pi

73
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hey, listen

74
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Alfa won't go anywhere

75
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And if she wants to go out, it must be my permission

76
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Now, you better leave

77
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't ever think about taking Alfa out of here

78
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And one more thing

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Stop messing up my house

80
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You keep sending me letters

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Now, get out of here

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Or else, I'll call the police to get you out of here

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Bye

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Just lock the door, Mi

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I won't open the door

87
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How to be polite

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can't do it anymore

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It means I have to use a less polite way

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Alfa?

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:47,000

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What are you doing to my grandma?

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hello, Alfa

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How do you know my name?

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You know it, don't you?

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Of course, you do

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, I don't want to go

I'm not a bad person

I don't want to go

I don't want to leave my grandma

She's right, Alfa

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Alfa, you have to go with me

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You want to go to school there, right?

112
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Your grandma doesn't want you to go

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But this is the only chance for you

114
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000

Don't worry

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She'll be fine

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000

Is the sorcerer here, soldier?

125
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
No, he's not

126
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Alfa, before you enter the sorcerer's school

127
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,320
You must have a Tongsis first

128
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Tongsis? The one that makes photos?

129
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,320
No, Tongsis is a short form of Tong

130
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Tongkat

131
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Si is a sorcerer

132
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
And Es is the meaning of a deity

133
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,320
So Tongsis is Tongkat, Sihir, and Sakti

134
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Now, go to the fruit shop

135
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
And take your Tongsis

136
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Is there really a Tongsis in the fruit shop?

137
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,320
A fish is playing circus

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,320

How do you know I'm here?

147
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Of course I know

148
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I always know who I am and where I am

How's it, Alfa?

177
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Did you find Tongsis?

178
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Yes, sir!

179
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Good!

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Yes, it's here

Okay?

191
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Only people like you, Alfa

192
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Can enter that special door

Now, find a boat

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
That can jump into the water

195
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
A boat that can jump into the water?

196
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Where is it?

197
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
You're so stubborn

198
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
You should try first

199
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay?

200
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Alfa!

201
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,320
This is for you

202
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:30,320
The army is coming!

203
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Army!

204
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,320
That's the army

205
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Sorry, sorry

206
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
It's okay

207
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
You have a pen too

208
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
So, you're from Siir School, right?

209
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Yes

210
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
You too?

211
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Yes

212
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
I have a friend

213
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
I'm Rey

214
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I'm Alfa

215
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Let's go in

216
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Let's go

217
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Wait, wait

218
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
What is this log?

219
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
I don't know

220
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
What is this log for?

221
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Okay, let's go

222
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
You!

223
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
That's for special kids

224
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Not like you

225
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,320
You don't have a seat

226
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
So, I'm a special kid

227
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,320
We have a special kid now!

228
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Which one?

229
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Just wait

230
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
We're going to die!

231
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
No!

232
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Don't go!

233
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Alfa!

234
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,320
The river is wet

235
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Yeah

236
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
It's going to be cold soon

237
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
How do you know?

238
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Have you been here before?

239
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Not yet

240
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Just this time

241
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Do you know where it is?

242
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
I don't know

243
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Now, we have to find our treasure

244
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,320
If you're smart, you should know where we should look for it

245
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
It must be around here

246
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Where do we look for it?

247
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Just let it flow

248
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Look for it one by one

249
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Okay

250
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Just follow him

251
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Maybe he's right

252
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Okay

253
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
I'm left behind

254
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Where is it?

255
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm left behind

256
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Where is it?

257
00:21:45,320 --> 00:22:01,320
It must be here

258
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Where is it?

259
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:14,320
That's the balloon

260
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
My name is written there

261
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Maybe that's it

262
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:28,320
That's so cool

263
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Awesome

264
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
That's him

265
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
He has my name

266
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:45,320
That's so cool

267
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
What?

268
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,320
This place is cool

269
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
There are bubbles

270
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Yeah

271
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Bubbles

272
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
That's so cool

273
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
I'm being followed

274
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
What?

275
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
You're being followed

276
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
No, no, no

277
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Don't touch me, just let me be

278
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Come on

279
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Why did you disappear?

280
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
That was fun, right?

281
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Yeah

282
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Oh no

283
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
What are you doing?

284
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
We're going to school

285
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Oh yeah

286
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I forgot

287
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Let's go

288
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Come on

289
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Stop

290
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Where are we going?

291
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
There?

292
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
I think

293
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
There

294
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Let's go

295
00:23:43,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Come on, hurry

296
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,320
That's so cool

297
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Yeah, the school

298
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:31,320
Let's go in

299
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Come on

300
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Good afternoon, kids

301
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Why is the hat so cheap?

302
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
I don't know

303
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
It's so cool

304
00:24:42,320 --> 00:25:02,320
We can do it

305
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
What are we doing, Sega?

306
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
We're going to school

307
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,320
[Train horn]

308
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Welcome, kids

309
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
I'm Professor Aldebaran

310
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
The head of the school here

311
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,320
You're here because of the special talent you have

312
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,320
That other kids don't have

313
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Now

314
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,320
The new students will be selected

315
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Good afternoon, kids

316
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Why is the hat so cheap?

317
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
It's so cool

318
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Are you surprised?

319
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
You'll be even more surprised

320
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,320
When I read your mind

321
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,320
I'll determine which ashram you'll go to

322
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Purnama or Gerhana

323
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,320
I'll go to Verga

324
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
I'll go to Gerhana

325
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:22,320
I'll go to Verga

326
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,320

328
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,320
I'll go to Verga

329
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I don't want to

330
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
[Laughing]

331
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,320
You'll make a mess

332
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,320
But you'll have a great loyalty

333
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320

Helps others

344
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
But

345
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Also full of tricks

346
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,320
You'll be selected in Gerhana

347
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Hey

348
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Why?

349
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Don't you like Gerhana?

350
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
It's okay

351
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Oh

352
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
You're hiding something

353
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,320
I can read your mind

354
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Come on, tell me

355
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Why don't you like to go to Gerhana?

356
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Come on

357
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Because I came here with Ray and Vega

358
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
They're my first friends

359
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,320
And I want to go to the same ashram as them in Purnama

360
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Oh, I see

361
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Okay

362
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Since you're honest

363
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
I'll let you in

364
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,320

[Applause]

366
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
What's wrong?

367
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,320
It seems like Guru Yomi is looking at me

368
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Now

369
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Say the keyword to enter the cave

Ray

378
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Do you hear that?

379
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
What's that?

380
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,320
That's the sound from there

381
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
What's wrong? I can't hear it

382
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I can't hear it

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Tentara, do you hear that?

385
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
There's a sound from there

386
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
The sound from that room

387
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
The sound of a triple head

388
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
What sound?

389
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
No, no

390
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
It's not

391
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
That's a secret room

392
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Secret room?

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
You ask too much

394
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,320
No, who said that's a secret?

395
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,320
You all don't go into that room

396
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Okay?

397
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
If you go into that room

398
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,320
You'll all be punished by the Guru

00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Yes

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320

I'm your classmate here

And today

407
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
You'll all learn a new language

Which is flying language

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
And this lollipop

410
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
You all have to hold this lollipop

411
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Because this will help you to fly

412
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
I don't want to fly

413
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Really?

414
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Good luck

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
That's our teacher

416
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Why a cat?

417
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
The cat taught us to fly

418
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Why are you all quiet?

Don't you run out of lollipop

If you run out of lollipop

422
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
You can't fly

423
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Why are you all quiet?

424
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Come on, now try to fly

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320

Now, after the lollipop has grown,

you say the mantra so you can fly.

438
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,740
The mantra is "Fly, Fang".

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:53,740

00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,740
