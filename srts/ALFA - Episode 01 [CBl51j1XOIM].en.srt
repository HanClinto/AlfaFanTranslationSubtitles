201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320

00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,740
...my friend.

586
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,740
Run, jump, and conquer...

00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,740
...the stars.

588
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:36,740
Be brave, don't give up.

Go, go, go, fight with all your heart.

593
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,740
Go, go, go, make yourself proud.

594
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,740
Go, go, go, let's dream.

595
