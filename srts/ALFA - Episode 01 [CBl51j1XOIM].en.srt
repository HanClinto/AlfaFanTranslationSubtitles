And if she wants to go out, it must be my permission

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000

Now, get out of here

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Or else, I'll call the police to get you out of here

You want to go to school there, right?

115

Tongsis? The one that makes photos?

132
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,320
No, Tongsis is a short form of Tong

Tongkat

134
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Si is a sorcerer

135
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
And Es is the meaning of a deity

136
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,320
So Tongsis is Tongkat, Sihir, and Sakti

137
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Now, go to the fruit shop

138
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
And take your Tongsis

139
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320

There's a special door

192
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
To the school

193
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Okay?

194
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Only people like you, Alfa

195
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Can enter that special door

196
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Now, find a boat

197
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
That can jump into the water

198
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
A boat that can jump into the water?

199
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Where is it?

200
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
You're so stubborn

201
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
You should try first

202
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay?

203
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Alfa!

204
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,320
This is for you

205
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:30,320
The army is coming!

206
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Army!

207
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,320
That's the army

208
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Sorry, sorry

209
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
It's okay

210
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
You have a pen too

211
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
So, you're from Siir School, right?

212
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Yes

213
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
You too?

214
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Yes

215
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
I have a friend

216
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
I'm Rey

217
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I'm Alfa

218
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Let's go in

219
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Let's go

220
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Wait, wait

221
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
What is this log?

222
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
I don't know

223
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
What is this log for?

224
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Okay, let's go

225
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
You!

226
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
That's for special kids

227
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Not like you

228
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,320
You don't have a seat

229
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
So, I'm a special kid

230
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,320
We have a special kid now!

231
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Which one?

232
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Just wait

233
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
We're going to die!

234
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
No!

235
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Don't go!

236
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Alfa!

237
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,320
The river is wet

238
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Yeah

239
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
It's going to be cold soon

240
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
How do you know?

241
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Have you been here before?

242
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Not yet

243
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Just this time

244
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Do you know where it is?

245
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
I don't know

246
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Now, we have to find our treasure

247
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,320
If you're smart, you should know where we should look for it

248
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
It must be around here

249
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Where do we look for it?

250
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Just let it flow

251
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Look for it one by one

252
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Okay

253
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Just follow him

254
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Maybe he's right

255
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Okay

256
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
I'm left behind

257
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Where is it?

258
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm left behind

259
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Where is it?

260
00:21:45,320 --> 00:22:01,320
It must be here

261
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Where is it?

262
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:14,320
That's the balloon

263
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
My name is written there

264
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Maybe that's it

265
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:28,320
That's so cool

266
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Awesome

267
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
That's him

268
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
He has my name

269
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:45,320
That's so cool

270
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
What?

271
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,320
This place is cool

272
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
There are bubbles

273
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Yeah

274
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Bubbles

275
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
That's so cool

276
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
I'm being followed

277
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
What?

278
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
You're being followed

279
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
No, no, no

280
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Don't touch me, just let me be

281
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Come on

282
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Why did you disappear?

283
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
That was fun, right?

284
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Yeah

285
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Oh no

286
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
What are you doing?

287
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
We're going to school

288
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Oh yeah

289
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I forgot

290
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Let's go

291
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Come on

292
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Stop

293
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Where are we going?

294
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
There?

295
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
I think

296
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
There

297
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Let's go

298
00:23:43,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Come on, hurry

299
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,320
That's so cool

300
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Yeah, the school

301
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:31,320
Let's go in

302
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Come on

303
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Good afternoon, kids

304
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Why is the hat so cheap?

305
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
I don't know

306
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
It's so cool

307
00:24:42,320 --> 00:25:02,320
We can do it

308
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
What are we doing, Sega?

309
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
We're going to school

310

[Train horn]

311
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Welcome, kids

312
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
I'm Professor Aldebaran

313
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
The head of the school here

314
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,320
You're here because of the special talent you have

315
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,320
That other kids don't have

316
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Now

317
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,320
The new students will be selected

318
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Good afternoon, kids

319
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Why is the hat so cheap?

320
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
It's so cool

321
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Are you surprised?

322
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
You'll be even more surprised

323
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,320
When I read your mind

324
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,320
I'll determine which ashram you'll go to

325
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Purnama or Gerhana

326
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,320
I'll go to Verga

327
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
I'll go to Gerhana

328
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:22,320
I'll go to Verga

I'll go to Verga

332
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I don't want to

333
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
[Laughing]

334
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,320
You'll make a mess

335
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,320
But you'll have a great loyalty

336
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320

Helps others

But

348
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Also full of tricks

349
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,320
You'll be selected in Gerhana

350
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Hey

351
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Why?

352
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Don't you like Gerhana?

353
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
It's okay

354
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Oh

355
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
You're hiding something

356
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,320
I can read your mind

357
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Come on, tell me

358
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Why don't you like to go to Gerhana?

359
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Come on

360
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Because I came here with Ray and Vega

361
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
They're my first friends

362
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,320
And I want to go to the same ashram as them in Purnama

363
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Oh, I see

364
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Okay

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Since you're honest

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
I'll let you in

367
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,320

What's wrong?

370
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,320
It seems like Guru Yomi is looking at me

371
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Now

372
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,320

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
What's that?

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
What's wrong? I can't hear it

385
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I can't hear it

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
There's a sound from there

389
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
The sound from that room

390
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
The sound of a triple head

391
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
What sound?

392
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
No, no

393
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
It's not

394
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
That's a secret room

395
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Secret room?

396
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
You ask too much

397
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,320
No, who said that's a secret?

398
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,320
You all don't go into that room

399
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Okay?

400
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
If you go into that room

401
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,320
You'll all be punished by the Guru

402
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Do you understand?

403
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Yes

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320

I'm your classmate here

And today

410
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
You'll all learn a new language

00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Which is flying language

412
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
And this lollipop

413
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
You all have to hold this lollipop

414
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Because this will help you to fly

415
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
I don't want to fly

416
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Really?

417
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Good luck

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
That's our teacher

419
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Why a cat?

420
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
The cat taught us to fly

421
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Why are you all quiet?

Don't you run out of lollipop

If you run out of lollipop

425
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
You can't fly

426
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Why are you all quiet?

427
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Come on, now try to fly

428
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320

Now, after the lollipop has grown,

you say the mantra so you can fly.

441
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,740
The mantra is "Fly, Fang".

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:53,740
Ruf, call Professor Aldebaran.

00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,740

Don't.
