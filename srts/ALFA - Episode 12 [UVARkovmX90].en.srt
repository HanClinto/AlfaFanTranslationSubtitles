1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This firecracker is really useful.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But we can't continue like this, Professor.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We have to find the sorcerer

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and stop him before he freezes this school.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I want to have a strange power.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can make everyone freeze.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Since we're friends,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll tell you my secret.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I also have a strange power.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't freeze.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alfa is safe,

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
even though his face is a little wounded.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The bad news is,

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the Dark Lord has taken the news away.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We give time until tomorrow morning.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If our Kris doesn't come back,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and our servants are no longer normal,

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
we will attack the sorcerer school.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And your teacher,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
your teacher will not be able to be able to be a normal person.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Your teacher will not come back.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How is this possible?

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We can't give Kris the fire.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If we give Kris the fire,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
the children can die of cold.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
[The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Plita must be lonely.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Poor Plita.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't leave Plita alone.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I have to help Plita.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:29,000
[The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We have to help them.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm worried they will be defeated.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I'm sure that Professor Purwa can handle it.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Because he has a high level of knowledge.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, Professor Purwa can take care of himself.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We have no other choice, Prof.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Whether we want to or not, we have to fight them.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is all for the sake of the children and the school.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
[The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh no, Professor Purwa has been kidnapped.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What about Plita? Who will look for her?

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
[The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's safe. We can open it.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh no, it's you guys.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You scared me.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're so lucky. You didn't ask us to come.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We can't sleep either.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm worried about Plita.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm worried about her too.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Poor her. She must be lonely.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's go find Plita.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We have to take responsibility.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We're the ones who brought her here.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, that's right.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's so cold. My hands are freezing.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's cold.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Alfa, try to find her using the telescope.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Where is she now?

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There she is.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
She's finally taken to the train.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Where are we going to take her?

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But how?

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She's frozen again.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We have to help her.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We can't give up.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, let's go.

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't do this anymore.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's so cold.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Vega!

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What do we do?

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Vega!

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't do this anymore.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Rih!

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What do we do?

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Rih, help me.

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't be a coward, Rih.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Rih!

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What do we do?

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Rih!

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Help me.

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Rih!

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:36,000
"The most dangerous place in Indonesia"

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
They think I'm an ordinary person.

97
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:54,000
"The most dangerous place in Indonesia"

98
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Where are you going, sir?

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Eka, Tri, Cato. Let me face him.

100
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:50,000
"The most dangerous place in Indonesia"

101
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Kara, nice to meet you again, Purwoh.

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:13:44,000
"The most dangerous place in Indonesia"

103
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You've seen it yourself

104
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The proof is not only the ice in the school's school yard

105
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And that is a very clear proof

106
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And all of this is a fabrication from him

107
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Along with all the lies in the magic school

108
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's lying!

109
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We didn't do that!

110
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We didn't steal the firecrackers!

111
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's a traitor!

112
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He's the one who did all of this!

113
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What else can you prove, Purwa?

114
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Everything is clear

115
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The Satria Chatur has seen for himself

116
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
How stupid he is now

117
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And you have no use for shouting like this now

118
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're done for, Garap

119
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're done for!

120
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:40,000
"The most dangerous place in Indonesia"

121
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Where are my phone and the car?

122
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Where are they?

123
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why did I get left behind?

124
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Alfa!

125
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Vega!

126
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Alfa!

127
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Vega!

128
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why did I get left behind?

129
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This hole!

130
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This hole is the only thing I want!

131
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I want to see Alfa and Vega

132
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Where are they?

133
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
"The most dangerous place in Indonesia"

134
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Alfa!

135
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Vega!

136
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So, you guys helped us

137
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you

138
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're so kind

139
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're welcome

140
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You're our friend, Vega

141
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Vega, where's Ray?

142
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why isn't he here?

143
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Where is he?

144
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We helped you

145
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why did you guys do that?

146
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I feel sorry for Ray

147
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I feel sorry for him

148
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I know

149
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We also had to help you, Alfa

150
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
We also helped you because we had to, Alfa

151
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If it wasn't for the girl who asked for it

152
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We wouldn't have helped the guy

153
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Right, girls?

154
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's right!

155
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Where are they?

156
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We have to find Ray

157
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What do we do?

158
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hi!

159
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
"The most dangerous place in Indonesia"

160
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hi, Alfa! Vega!

161
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hi, Angsa!

162
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm so lucky

163
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was in a relationship with a girl

164
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If it wasn't for her, I would have been a bad person

165
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
How did you know we're here?

166
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Rayna

167
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Ray...

168
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Rayna!

169
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
How did you know we're here?

170
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What are you doing here?

171
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
How do you know?

172
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because of this

173
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Thank you

174
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We're sorry for the school

175
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Because the weather is so extreme

176
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We have to help her

177
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We have to find her

178
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
She's a bad person

179
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Girls!

180
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yippie!

181
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Girls!

182
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Lotion!

183
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Cold water!

184
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You'll use this

185
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What's this for?

186
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The lotion will help you stay cool

187
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So you can stay strong in the snow

188
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Wow! That's so cool!

189
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you!

190
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're welcome, Vega!

191
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's go!

192
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Where is your friend?

193
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Wait, I'll look for her

194
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Ray, where are you?

195
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There she is!

196
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
She's not here

197
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sure she's not here

198
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
She's not here

199
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm sure she's not here

200
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
She's not here

201
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Her name is...

202
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The Black Mountain

203
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Do you know where it is?

204
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I know where it is

205
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
How can we get there?

206
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We'll take you there

207
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's so cool!

208
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Girls!

209
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We're in the Yippie!

210
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You guys go up now

211
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's so cool!

212
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes

213
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Girls!

214
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Pelita

215
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You have to be able to keep your emotions

216
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can't be afraid

217
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And you can't care about others

218
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you care

219
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You'll be disappointed

220
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And you'll be hurt

221
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sure everything will be better

222
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's so fun to ride a kite

223
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, it's so different from a lollipop

224
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
By the way, where did you get this kite?

225
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I was going to the hill

226
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I thought if I don't have a boyfriend

227
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't like men

228
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So I got this kite

229
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Where did you get it?

230
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I got it from them

231
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's so fun!

232
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This is so fun!

233
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What's that?

234
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Help!

235
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yippie!

236
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's not over yet

237
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm going to ride a kite

238
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I followed you to the hill

239
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I thought if I don't have a boyfriend

240
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't like men

241
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's so funny

242
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm so funny

243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're so smart

244
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's fun

245
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Have all the kids eaten?

246
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yes, sir

247
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Looks like professor Andebar is stressed

248
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because he's thinking about the other soldiers

249
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And I have to keep Ray, Vega, and Alfa safe

250
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Megantara, call Agni and Yasmin

251
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We have to get out of here

252
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Because soon, the elves will come

253
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yes, sir

254
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Andebaran!

255
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Get out!

256
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Get out, all of you!

257
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Give them a fire crisis

258
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'll count to ten

259
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If you don't give them a fire crisis

260
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We'll attack

261
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They're seriously attacking us

262
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We have to fight

263
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
If not, our school will be destroyed

264
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That's right, professor

265
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And the students will be the victims

266
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Listen up

267
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We're peacekeepers

268
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
We don't want a war

269
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But we won't stay quiet

270
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If there's a side that's threatening us

271
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We'll use our abilities

272
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
To protect the kids

273
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Let's go

274
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We'll unite

275
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
To protect this school and the kids

276
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
For the sake of all of us

277
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Get out, boss! Our squad is under attack!

278
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What? Attack?

279
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What are you doing?

280
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'll kill you!

281
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'll take your crisis!

282
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Where's the crisis?

283
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We've decided to fight

284
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And defend the crisis

285
00:26:25,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Attack!

286
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We won't stop until we get that crisis

287
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
As long as we're united

288
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
United?

289
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What's wrong, Aldibaran?

290
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Are you afraid of losing?

291
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You don't know how I use my power

292
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You're all cowards

293
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Who do you think we're losing to?

294
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Professor Aldibaran's abilities

295
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Are far superior to yours

296
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm not happy with this

297
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You see, everything's frozen

298
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We can't be active

299
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And we need the crisis

300
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
To handle the kids

301
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If they can make it

302
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay

303
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll go

304
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We've released your teacher

305
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Thank you

306
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Now, let's find that kid named Plita

307
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yasmin, take care of the kids

308
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't let them leave the building

309
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Before it gets cold again

310
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yes, Professor

311
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Damn it, they're all united

312
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We can't let this happen

313
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I have to fight them

314
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Thank you, Miss Sangsah

315
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You're so kind to help us

316
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You're welcome, Plita

317
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yippie, yippie, yay!

318
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Rega, if you need anything

319
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Just call us

320
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We'll help you

321
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Girls

322
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Thank you, bye

323
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Bye

324
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Bye, Plita

325
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm so tired

326
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm so tired of being a girl

327
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Plita, I want to fight you

328
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Don't touch me

329
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What's wrong? Are you mad?

330
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm sorry, we left you yesterday

331
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But, we're back now

332
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yes

333
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You should go back to school with us

334
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Do you want to?

335
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Because everyone is asking about you

336
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yes, we're all so mad at you

337
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Plita, we'll play together again

338
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I promise I won't leave you

339
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I promise

340
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You have to forget them all

341
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Who's that? Why is he bringing Plita here?

342
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Plita, you have to make a decision

343
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Do you want to stay here with me

344
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Or do you want to go with them?

345
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm going to go with them

346
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Plita, don't you forget?

347
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We promised to be together

348
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Plita, you have to focus on your recovery

349
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Don't go with him

350
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You have to kick him out of this school

351
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We have to go with him

352
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let's go

353
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Why are you wasting time with him?

354
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You guys go from here

355
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Why are you kicking us out?

356
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I want to stay here

357
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You guys go

358
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I want to take you home

359
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Don't you dare to leave

360
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Plita, your hand

361
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Come here, I want to see

362
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Don't touch me

363
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Plita, are you okay?

364
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Plita, you're so brave

365
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Do you know?

366
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Only bad people dare to attack their own friends

367
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Ali is a bad person

368
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
We all came here because he's a bad person

369
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
He's not a bad person

370
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
He just can't control himself

371
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
He's like my brother

372
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So, I want to protect him

373
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Plita, let's go home

374
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Let's go back to school

375
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Plita

376
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
If you want to go with them

377
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You have to kick him out

378
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Easter egg, what should we do?

379
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Easter egg, take them away from here

380
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Plita, don't

381
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's a monster

382
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You have to think for yourself

383
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And you have to let go of your love for others

384
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because that feeling can destroy you

385
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We can do it

386
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let go of me

387
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
What you're doing now is right

388
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You have to train yourself so you can be cured

389
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Goodbye, Vega, Alfa, and Kare

390
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
A year later

391
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Why are we still here?

392
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We came all the way here just to be kicked out by Plita

393
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Let's go home

394
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yes, let's go home

395
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Vega

396
00:36:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Stay here, I want to meet Plita

397
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Stop it!

398
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Hold your emotions

399
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I can heal Agni

400
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
This is all a misunderstanding

401
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We should be united

402
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
One

403
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It hurts!

404
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm tired, I want to go home

405
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah, let's go home

406
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Where are you going?

407
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Let me go!

408
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I want to take Plita home

409
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Vega, don't be like that

410
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That monster has hit you

411
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
What if we go there again?

412
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Let's go home

413
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I want to try

414
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm sure Plita is a good girl

415
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
She has a kind heart

416
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I want to talk to her

417
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What's the relationship between you two?

418
00:46:42,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I'm sure Plita will be affected

419
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I agree with you

420
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Best friend forever

421
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Havancur

422
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Plita, let's go

423
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Plita, wait for me

424
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,960
(Groaning)

425
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,480
(Banging)

426
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:23,980
(Groaning)

427
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,980
Serba !

428
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:41,420
(Groaning)

429
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,040
Hey !

430
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,000
You should run !

431
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:59,360
(Groaning)

432
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,360
Where are we ?

433
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,860
We're here !

434
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,860
Do you want to play ?

435
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:15,360
Brita !

436
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,860
Come here !

437
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:21,360
Let's play !

438
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,860
Come on Brita !

439
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,860
Let's play !

440
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,860
Or else,

441
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,860
we'll go the wrong way !

442
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,360
(Bang)

443
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,360
Come here !

444
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,360
Turntable !

445
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,360
Yes !

446
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Number 6 !

447
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,860
6 !

448
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,860
I'll go again !

449
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,860
Turntable !

450
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:54,860
Yes !

451
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,860
4 !

452
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,860
Yes !

453
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,860
Number 10 !

454
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,860
Now, you Brita !

455
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:11,360
Yes !

456
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,860
5 !

457
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,860
Yeah !

458
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,860
Are you happy playing this ?

459
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,860
I'm so happy !

460
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,860
Especially,

461
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,860
if you play this at school, Brita !

462
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,860
It'll be more fun !

463
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
There are many kids playing this !

464
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,860
Yes !

465
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,860
That's why,

466
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,860
you should go home, Brita !

467
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,860
We can play together again !

468
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,860
You should go home, Brita !

469
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,860
Please !

470
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860
We've promised

471
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,360
to be friends !

472
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,860
Besides,

473
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,860
you're not lonely here, right ?

474
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,360
You should go home !

475
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Please !

476
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,360
We'll play together again !

477
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,860
Okay, let's go !

478
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:17,360
So, you want to go with Vega ?

479
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,360
Yes,

480
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,860
it's all up to you.

481
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,860
But, you should remember my words.

482
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,360
You shouldn't use your feelings.

483
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,360
Because, feelings

484
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,860
will only hurt you.

485
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,360
And you shouldn't care about others.

486
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,360
Because, caring about others

487
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,360
will only make you sad.

488
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,360
I'm sorry, Sir.

489
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,360
But, I can't leave Vega.

490
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:49,860
It's okay.

491
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,860
You should use this.

492
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,860
If you need my help,

493
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,860
you should use this.

494
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,360
I'll come to help you,

495
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,360
wherever you are.

496
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,360
Thank you, Sir.

497
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:14,360
Audrey !

498
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:22,860
Let me go !

499
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,860
I beg you !

500
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,860
Let me go !

501
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:33,860
I'm sorry !

502
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:48,860
Audrey !

503
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:59,860
Are you okay ?

504
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,860
I'm okay, Sir.

505
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,360
I just got hit by a car.

506
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,860
I'm sorry.

507
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,860
It's okay.

508
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,860
Sir,

509
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,860
now, we're going home together.

510
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,860
Wow, that's great !

511
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,860
But, don't touch me.

512
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
You'll get cold.

513
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,860
Yes,

514
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,860
when we get there,

515
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,860
we'll meet the Eid Professor.

516
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,860
I'm sure,

517
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,860
the Eid Professor

518
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,860
can cure you.

519
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,860
Let's go home.

520
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,860
Let's go !

521
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,860
I'm so happy to be with you.

522
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,860
Me too.

523
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,860
Especially me.

524
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,860
Sir,

525
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,860
come here.

526
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,860
Can I ask for a favor ?

527
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,860
Sure, what is it ?

528
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,860
Can you find the Eid Professor ?

529
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,860
Later.

530
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,860
You tell him,

531
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,860
if we're together,

532
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,860
we'll be able to solve the Eid problem.

533
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,860
If we're together,

534
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,860
we'll be on the way home.

535
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,860
Okay.

536
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,860
Thank you, Sir.

537
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,860
You're welcome, Alpha.

538
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:14,860
There's a message from Alpha.

539
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,860
Alpha is on the way home with Felita.

540
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:24,860
Megantam,

541
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,860
why is Alpha outside the school ?

542
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,860
Actually,

543
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,860
I wanted to tell you this morning.

544
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,860
But,

545
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,860
the Eid Professor hasn't come yet.

546
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,860
So,

547
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,860
I forgot.

548
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,860
Tell Alpha,

549
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,860
I'll be waiting for him,

550
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,860
in this bamboo forest.

551
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,860
Okay, Sir.

552
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,860
Thank you.

553
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,860
You're welcome, Sir.

554
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,860
We should rest here,

555
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,860
while waiting for Alpha and Felita.

556
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,860
Megantam,

557
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,860
next time,

558
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,860
you have to tell me everything.

559
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,860
Okay.

560
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,860
Cook it in the stove,

561
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,860
so it won't get dirty.

562
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,860
I'll always report to the Professor.

563
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,860
[Megantam, thank you for coming!]

564
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:56,860
[Alpha, thank you for coming!]

565
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:07,860
You must have poisoned the food,

566
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,860
right?

567
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,860
No, I didn't put anything in the food.

568
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:16,860
Don't be reckless.

569
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,860
Professor Agni won't do that.

570
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,860
Shut up!

571
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,860
Wait!

572
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,860
Be patient.

573
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:27,860
Let me help you cure him.

574
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:34,860
No need.

575
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,860
Let me do it.

576
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:41,860
You want revenge, right?

577
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
Hey,

578
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,860
go to Gandaria,

579
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,860
buy a light sharp sword.

580
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,860
Ksatria,

581
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,860
remember,

582
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,860
slander is more cruel than murder.

583
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,860
You can see for yourself,

584
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,860
that this is a statement,

585
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,860
not a slander.

586
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:19,860
Alright,

587
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,860
let's go our separate ways.

588
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,860
We will use our own way.

589
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:36,860
Wait,

590
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,860
Professor!

591
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,860
Just leave it.

592
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,860
No need to be restrained.

593
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,860
For what?

594
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,860
We should all be united,

595
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,860
not separated like this.

596
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,860
I don't agree.

597
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,860
Well,

598
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,860
they are the ones who are looking for trouble.

599
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:14,860
Where is he?

600
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,860
He's so thin.

601
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,860
He might attack us.

602
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,860
You guys go first.

603
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,860
Alright.

604
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,860
Let's go, Prita.

605
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:31,860
Alfa?

606
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,860
Oh no,

607
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,860
where is Alfa?

608
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,860
Oh no,

609
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,860
the ghost is gone.

610
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,860
Alfa is attacked.

611
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,860
What should we do?

612
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,860
Prita,

613
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,860
you stay here.

614
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,860
I will look for Rey and Alfa.

615
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,860
Alfa!

616
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,860
Rey!

617
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:56,860
Alfa!

618
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,860
Rey!

619
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,860
Where are you guys?

620
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,860
Alfa!

621
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,860
Rey!

622
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,860
Alfa!

623
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,860
Rey!

624
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,860
Alfa!

625
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,860
Where are you guys?

626
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:30,860
Who are you?

627
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:38,860
Don't move.

628
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,860
Don't make any noise.

629
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,860
Where is the cafe?

630
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,860
It's been a long time.

631
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,860
Where is the cafe?

632
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,860
It's been a long time.

633
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,860
[Ghost]

634
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,860
Let me go!

635
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,860
Help!

636
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,860
Shut up!

637
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,860
If you call them,

638
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,860
they will come to your house.

639
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:33,860
Maybe this is a trap.

640
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,860
Vega,

641
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,860
Rey,

642
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,860
and Alfa

643
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,860
work with these people.

644
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:43,860
Why are they with me?

645
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,860
I trust Vega.

646
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:47,860
Vega!

647
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,860
[Ghost]

648
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,860
Finally, you called them.

649
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:28,860
Help, Sir!

650
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,860
Pelita,

651
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,860
you have to gather your power

652
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,860
and attack them.

653
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:41,860
Now, throw your sick people.

654
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:42,860
Hurry!

655
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,860
She is so brave.

656
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,860
She made Vega become like this.

657
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,860
I told you,

658
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,860
she is a monster.

659
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,860
That's why we have to stay away from her.

660
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:40,860
[Ghost]

661
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,860
Go! Go! Go!

662
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:47,860
Fight with the power of your heart

663
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,860
Go! Go! Go!

664
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,860
Make yourself proud

665
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,860
Go! Go! Go!

666
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,860
Let's dream

667
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,860
Go! Go! Go!

668
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,860
We will win
