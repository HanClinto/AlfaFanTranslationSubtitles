 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Thank you.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 This firecracker is really useful.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But we can't continue like this, Professor.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 We have to find the sorcerer

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 and stop him before he freezes this school.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I want to have a strange power.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I can make everyone freeze.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Since we're friends,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I'll tell you my secret.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I also have a strange power.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I can't freeze.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Alva is safe,

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 even though his face is a little wounded.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 The bad news is,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 the Dark Lord has taken the news away.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 We give time until tomorrow morning.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 If our Kris doesn't come back,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 and our servants are no longer normal,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 we will attack the sorcerer school.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And your teacher,

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 your teacher will not be able to be able to be a normal person.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Your teacher will not come back.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 How is this possible?

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 We can't give Kris the fire.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 If we give Kris the fire,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 the children can die of cold.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 [The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Plita must be lonely.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Poor Plita.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I can't leave Plita alone.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I have to help Plita.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 [The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000

 [The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 We have to help them.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I'm worried they will be defeated.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But I'm sure that Professor Purwa can handle it.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Because he has a high level of knowledge.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So, Professor Purwa can take care of himself.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 We have no other choice, Prof.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Whether we want to or not, we have to fight them.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 This is all for the sake of the children and the school.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 [The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Oh no, Professor Purwa has been kidnapped.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 What about Plita? Who will look for her?

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 [The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 [The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 [The Dark Lord has taken the news away]

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It's safe. We can open it.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Oh no, it's you guys.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 You scared me.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 You're so lucky. You didn't ask us to come.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 We can't sleep either.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I'm worried about Plita.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I'm worried about her too.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Poor her. She must be lonely.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Let's go find Plita.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 We have to take responsibility.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 We're the ones who brought her here.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Yes, that's right.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Okay.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 It's so cold. My hands are freezing.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 It's cold.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Alva, try to find her using the telescope.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Where is she now?

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 There she is.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 She's finally taken to the train.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Where are we going to take her?

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 But how?

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 She's frozen again.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 We have to help her.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 We can't give up.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Okay, let's go.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 I can't do this anymore.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It's so cold.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 It's so cold.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Vega!

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 What do we do?

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Vega!

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I can't do this anymore.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Rih!

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 What do we do?

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Rih, help me.

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Don't be a coward, Rih.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Rih!

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 What do we do?

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Rih!

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Help me.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Help me.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Help me.

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Help me.

114

 And that is a very clear proof

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000

 Along with all the lies in the magic school

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 We didn't do that!

 Vega, where's Ray?

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Why isn't he here?

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Where is he?

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We helped you

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Why did you guys do that?

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 I feel sorry for Ray

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000

322
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 We also had to help you, Alva

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 We also helped you because we had to, Alva

324
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 If it wasn't for the girl who asked for it

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 We wouldn't have helped the guy

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Right, girls?

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 That's right!

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Where are they?

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000

 Hi, Angsa!

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I'm so lucky

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I was in a relationship with a girl

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 If it wasn't for her, I would have been a bad person

338
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 How did you know we're here?

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000

 How did you know we're here?

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 What are you doing here?

344
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 How do you know?

345
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Because of this

346
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Thank you

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 We're sorry for the school

348
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Because the weather is so extreme

349
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 We have to help her

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 We have to find her

351
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 She's a bad person

352
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000

 Cold water!

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Cold water!

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 You'll use this

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 What's this for?

360
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 The lotion will help you stay cool

361
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 So you can stay strong in the snow

362
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Wow! That's so cool!

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Where is your friend?

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Wait, I'll look for her

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Ray, where are you?

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 There she is!

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 She's not here

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I'm sure she's not here

372
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 She's not here

373
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I'm sure she's not here

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I'm sure she's not here

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I'm sure she's not here

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I'm sure she's not here

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I'm sure she's not here

378
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I'm sure she's not here

379
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I'm sure she's not here

380
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I'm sure she's not here

381
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I'm sure she's not here

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 I'm sure she's not here

383
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I'm sure she's not here

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 She's not here

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Her name is...

386
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Her name is...

387
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 The Black Mountain

388
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Do you know where it is?

389
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I know where it is

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 How can we get there?

391
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 We'll take you there

392
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 That's so cool!

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Girls!

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 We're in the Yippie!

395
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 You guys go up now

396
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 That's so cool!

397
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Yes

398
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Girls!

399
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Girls!

400
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Pelita

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 You have to be able to keep your emotions

402
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 You can't be afraid

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 You can't be afraid

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And you can't care about others

405
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 If you care

406
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 You'll be disappointed

407
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And you'll be hurt

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 I'm sure everything will be better

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 It's so fun to ride a kite

410
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Yes, it's so different from a lollipop

411
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 By the way, where did you get this kite?

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 I was going to the hill

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I was going to the hill

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I thought if I don't have a boyfriend

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 I don't like men

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So I got this kite

417
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Where did you get it?

418
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I got it from them

419
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It's so fun!

420
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's so fun!

421
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 This is so fun!

422
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 What's that?

423
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Help!

424
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Help!

425
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Help!

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Yippie!

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 It's not over yet

428
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I'm going to ride a kite

429
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 I followed you to the hill

430
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 I thought if I don't have a boyfriend

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I don't like men

432
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 That's so funny

433
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I'm so funny

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 You're so smart

435
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 You're so smart

436
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 It's fun

437
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 To be continued...

438
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 To be continued...

439
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 To be continued...

440
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Have all the kids eaten?

441
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Yes, sir

442
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Looks like professor Andebar is stressed

443
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Because he's thinking about the other soldiers

444
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And I have to keep Ray, Vega, and Alva safe

445
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Megantara, call Agni and Yasmin

446
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 We have to get out of here

447
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Because soon, the elves will come

448
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Yes, sir

449
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Andebaran!

450
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Get out!

451
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Get out, all of you!

452
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Give them a fire crisis

453
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I'll count to ten

454
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 If you don't give them a fire crisis

455
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 We'll attack

456
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 They're seriously attacking us

457
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 We have to fight

458
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 If not, our school will be destroyed

459
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 That's right, professor

460
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And the students will be the victims

461
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Listen up

462
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 We're peacekeepers

463
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 We don't want a war

464
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 But we won't stay quiet

465
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 If there's a side that's threatening us

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 We'll use our abilities

467
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 To protect the kids

468
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Let's go

469
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 We'll unite

470
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 To protect this school and the kids

471
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 For the sake of all of us

472
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Get out, boss! Our squad is under attack!

473
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 What? Attack?

474
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 What are you doing?

475
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I'll kill you!

476
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I'll take your crisis!

477
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Where's the crisis?

478
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 We've decided to fight

479
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And defend the crisis

480
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Attack!

481
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Attack!

482
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Attack!

483
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Attack!

484
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Attack!

485
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Attack!

486
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Attack!

487
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Attack!

488
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Attack!

489
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Attack!

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Attack!

491
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Attack!

492
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Attack!

493
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Attack!

494
00:27:40,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Attack!

495
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 We won't stop until we get that crisis

496
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 As long as we're united

497
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 United?

498
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 What's wrong, Aldibaran?

499
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Are you afraid of losing?

500
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 You don't know how I use my power

501
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 You're all cowards

502
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Who do you think we're losing to?

503
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Professor Aldibaran's abilities

504
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Are far superior to yours

505
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I'm not happy with this

506
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 You see, everything's frozen

507
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 We can't be active

508
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And we need the crisis

509
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 To handle the kids

510
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 If they can make it

511
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Okay

512
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I'll go

513
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 I'll go

514
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I'll go

515
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 I'll go

516
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 I'll go

517
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 We've released your teacher

518
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Thank you

519
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Now, let's find that kid named Plita

520
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Yasmin, take care of the kids

521
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Don't let them leave the building

522
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Before it gets cold again

523
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Yes, Professor

524
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Damn it, they're all united

525
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 We can't let this happen

526
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I have to fight them

527
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Thank you, Miss Sangsah

528
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 You're so kind to help us

529
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 You're welcome, Plita

530
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Yippie, yippie, yay!

531
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Rega, if you need anything

532
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Just call us

533
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 We'll help you

534
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Girls

535
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Thank you, bye

536
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Bye

537
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Bye, Plita

538
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I'm so tired

539
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I'm so tired of being a girl

540
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Plita, I want to fight you

541
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Don't touch me

542
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 What's wrong? Are you mad?

543
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I'm sorry, we left you yesterday

544
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 But, we're back now

545
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Yes

546
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 You should go back to school with us

547
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Do you want to?

548
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Because everyone is asking about you

549
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Yes, we're all so mad at you

550
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Plita, we'll play together again

551
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 I promise I won't leave you

552
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I promise

553
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 You have to forget them all

554
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Who's that? Why is he bringing Plita here?

555
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Plita, you have to make a decision

556
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Do you want to stay here with me

557
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Or do you want to go with them?

558
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 I'm going to go with them

559
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Plita, don't you forget?

560
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 We promised to be together

561
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Plita, you have to focus on your recovery

562
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Don't go with him

563
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 You have to kick him out of this school

564
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 We have to go with him

565
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Let's go

566
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Why are you wasting time with him?

567
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 You guys go from here

568
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Why are you kicking us out?

569
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I want to stay here

570
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 You guys go

571
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 I want to take you home

572
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Don't you dare to leave

573
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Plita, your hand

574
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Come here, I want to see

575
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Don't touch me

576
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Plita, are you okay?

577
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Plita, you're so brave

578
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Do you know?

579
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Only bad people dare to attack their own friends

580
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Ali is a bad person

581
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 We all came here because he's a bad person

582
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 He's not a bad person

583
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 He just can't control himself

584
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 He's like my brother

585
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 So, I want to protect him

586
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Plita, let's go home

587
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Let's go back to school

588
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Plita

589
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 If you want to go with them

590
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 You have to kick him out

591
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Easter egg, what should we do?

592
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Easter egg, take them away from here

593
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Plita, don't

594
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 It's a monster

595
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 It's a monster

596
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 You have to think for yourself

597
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 And you have to let go of your love for others

598
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Because that feeling can destroy you

599
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 We can do it

600
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 We can do it

601
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Let go of me

602
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Let go of me

603
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Let go of me

604
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 What you're doing now is right

605
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 You have to train yourself so you can be cured

606
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Goodbye, Vega, Alva, and Kare

607
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 A year later

608
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Why are we still here?

609
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 We came all the way here just to be kicked out by Plita

610
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Let's go home

611
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Yes, let's go home

612
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Vega

613
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:22,000

923
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 I'm sure Plita will be affected

924
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 I agree with you

925
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Best friend forever

926
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 Best friend forever

927
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 Best friend forever

928

 Havancur

929
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Plita, let's go

930
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Plita, let's go

931
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Plita, wait for me

932
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 Plita, wait for me

933
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,960

 (Groaning)

945
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,040
 Hey !

946
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,000
 You should run !

947
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 (Groaning)

948
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,580

 (Groaning)

952
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,360
 Where are we ?

953
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,860
 We're here !

954
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,860
 Do you want to play ?

955
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:13,860
 Brita !

956
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,360

958
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:21,360
 Let's play !

959
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,860

 Let's play !

961
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,860
 Or else,

962
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,860
 we'll go the wrong way !

963
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,360

 Yes !

967
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
 Number 6 !

968
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,860

969
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,860

 Yeah !

993
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,860
 Are you happy playing this ?

994
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,860
 I'm so happy !

995
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,860
 Especially,

996
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,860
 if you play this at school, Brita !

997
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,860
 It'll be more fun !

998
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
 There are many kids playing this !

999
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,860
 Yes !

1000
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,860
 That's why,

1001
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,860
 you should go home, Brita !

1002
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,860
 We can play together again !

1003
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,860
 You should go home, Brita !

1004
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,860
 Please !

1005
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860
 We've promised

1006
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,360
 to be friends !

1007
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,860
 Besides,

1008
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,860
 you're not lonely here, right ?

1009
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,360
 You should go home !

1010
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
 Please !

1011
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,360
 We'll play together again !

1012
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,860
 Okay, let's go !

1013
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:17,360
 So, you want to go with Vega ?

1014
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,360
 Yes,

1015
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,860
 it's all up to you.

1016
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,860
 But, you should remember my words.

1017
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,360
 You shouldn't use your feelings.

1018
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,360
 Because, feelings

1019
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,860
 will only hurt you.

1020
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,360
 And you shouldn't care about others.

1021
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,360
 Because, caring about others

1022
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,360
 will only make you sad.

1023
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,360
 I'm sorry, Sir.

1024
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,360
 But, I can't leave Vega.

1025
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:49,860
 It's okay.

1026
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,860
 You should use this.

1027
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,860
 If you need my help,

1028
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,860
 you should use this.

1029
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,360
 I'll come to help you,

1030
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,360
 wherever you are.

1031
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,360
 Thank you, Sir.

1032
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:14,360
 Audrey !

1033
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,360
 Let me go !

1034
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,860
 Let me go !

1035
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
 Let me go !

1036
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,860
 Let me go !

1037
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,860
 I beg you !

1038
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,860
 Let me go !

1039
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:32,860
 I'm sorry !

1040
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,860
 I'm sorry !

1041
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,860
 Audrey !

1042
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:48,860
 Audrey !

1043
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:59,860
 Are you okay ?

1044
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,860
 I'm okay, Sir.

1045
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,360
 I just got hit by a car.

1046
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,860
 I'm sorry.

1047
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,860
 It's okay.

1048
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,860
 Sir,

1049
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,860
 now, we're going home together.

1050
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,860
 Wow, that's great !

1051
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,860
 But, don't touch me.

1052
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
 You'll get cold.

1053
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,860
 Yes,

1054
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,860
 when we get there,

1055
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,860
 we'll meet the Eid Professor.

1056
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,860
 I'm sure,

1057
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,860
 the Eid Professor

1058
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,860
 can cure you.

1059
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,860
 Let's go home.

1060
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,860
 Let's go !

1061
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,860
 I'm so happy to be with you.

1062
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,860
 Me too.

1063
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,860
 Especially me.

1064
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,860
 Sir,

1065
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,860
 come here.

1066
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,860
 Can I ask for a favor ?

1067
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,860
 Sure, what is it ?

1068
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,860
 Can you find the Eid Professor ?

1069
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,860
 Later.

1070
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,860
 You tell him,

1071
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,860
 if we're together,

1072
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,860
 we'll be able to solve the Eid problem.

1073
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,860
 If we're together,

1074
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,860
 we'll be on the way home.

1075
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,860
 Okay.

1076
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,860
 Thank you, Sir.

1077
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,860
 You're welcome, Alpha.

1078
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:14,860
 There's a message from Alpha.

1079
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,860
 Alpha is on the way home with Felita.

1080
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:24,860
 Megantam,

1081
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,860
 why is Alpha outside the school ?

1082
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,860
 Actually,

1083
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,860
 I wanted to tell you this morning.

1084
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,860
 But,

1085
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,860
 the Eid Professor hasn't come yet.

1086
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,860
 So,

1087
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,860
 I forgot.

1088
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,860
 Tell Alpha,

1089
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,860
 I'll be waiting for him,

1090
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,860
 in this bamboo forest.

1091
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,860
 Okay, Sir.

1092
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,860
 Thank you.

1093
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,860
 You're welcome, Sir.

1094
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,860
 We should rest here,

1095
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,860
 while waiting for Alpha and Felita.

1096
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,860
 Megantam,

1097
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,860
 next time,

1098
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,860
 you have to tell me everything.

1099
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,860
 Okay.

1100
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,860
 Cook it in the stove,

1101
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,860
 so it won't get dirty.

1102
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,860
 I'll always report to the Professor.

1103
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,860
 [Megantam, thank you for coming!]

1104
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1105
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1106
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1107
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1108
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1109
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1110
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1111
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1112
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1113
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,860
 [Alpha, thank you for coming!]

1114
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:07,860
 You must have poisoned the food,

1115
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,860
 right?

1116
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,860
 No, I didn't put anything in the food.

1117
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:16,860
 Don't be reckless.

1118
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,860
 Professor Agni won't do that.

1119
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,860
 Shut up!

1120
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,860
 Wait!

1121
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,860
 Be patient.

1122
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:27,860
 Let me help you cure him.

1123
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:34,860
 No need.

1124
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,860
 Let me do it.

1125
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:41,860
 You want revenge, right?

1126
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
 Hey,

1127
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,860
 go to Gandaria,

1128
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,860
 buy a light sharp sword.

1129
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,860
 Ksatria,

1130
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,860
 remember,

1131
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,860
 slander is more cruel than murder.

1132
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,860
 You can see for yourself,

1133
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,860
 that this is a statement,

1134
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,860
 not a slander.

1135
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:19,860
 Alright,

1136
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,860
 let's go our separate ways.

1137
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,860
 We will use our own way.

1138
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:36,860
 Wait,

1139
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,860
 Professor!

1140
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,860
 Just leave it.

1141
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,860
 No need to be restrained.

1142
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,860
 For what?

1143
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,860
 We should all be united,

1144
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,860
 not separated like this.

1145
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,860
 I don't agree.

1146
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,860
 Well,

1147
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,860
 they are the ones who are looking for trouble.

1148
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:14,860
 Where is he?

1149
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,860
 He's so thin.

1150
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,860
 He might attack us.

1151
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,860
 You guys go first.

1152
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,860
 Alright.

1153
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,860
 Let's go, Prita.

1154
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:28,860
 Alva?

1155
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,860
 Alva?

1156
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,860
 Alva?

1157
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,860
 Oh no,

1158
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,860
 where is Alva?

1159
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,860
 Oh no,

1160
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,860
 the ghost is gone.

1161
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,860
 Alva is attacked.

1162
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,860
 What should we do?

1163
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,860
 What should we do?

1164
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,860
 Prita,

1165
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,860
 you stay here.

1166
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,860
 I will look for Rey and Alva.

1167
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,860
 Alva!

1168
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,860
 Rey!

1169
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,860
 Rey!

1170
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,860
 Alva!

1171
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,860
 Alva!

1172
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,860
 Rey!

1173
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,860
 Where are you guys?

1174
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,860
 Alva!

1175
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,860
 Rey!

1176
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,860
 Alva!

1177
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,860
 Rey!

1178
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,860
 Alva!

1179
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,860
 Where are you guys?

1180
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:30,860
 Who are you?

1181
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:38,860
 Don't move.

1182
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,860
 Don't make any noise.

1183
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,860
 Where is the cafe?

1184
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,860
 It's been a long time.

1185
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,860
 Where is the cafe?

1186
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,860
 It's been a long time.

1187
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:48,860
 It's been a long time.

1188
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,860
 [Ghost]

1189
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,860
 Let me go!

1190
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,860
 Help!

1191
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,860
 Help!

1192
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,860
 Shut up!

1193
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,860
 If you call them,

1194
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,860
 they will come to your house.

1195
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:33,860
 Maybe this is a trap.

1196
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,860
 Vega,

1197
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,860
 Rey,

1198
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,860
 and Alva

1199
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,860
 work with these people.

1200
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:43,860
 Why are they with me?

1201
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,860
 I trust Vega.

1202
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:47,860
 Vega!

1203
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,860
 [Ghost]

1204
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,860
 Finally, you called them.

1205
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:28,860
 Help, Sir!

1206
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,860
 Pelita,

1207
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,860
 you have to gather your power

1208
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,860
 and attack them.

1209
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:41,860
 Now, throw your sick people.

1210
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:42,860
 Hurry!

1211
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,860
 She is so brave.

1212
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,860
 She made Vega become like this.

1213
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,860
 I told you,

1214
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,860
 she is a monster.

1215
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,860
 That's why we have to stay away from her.

1216
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,860
 [Ghost]

1217
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,860
 [Ghost]

1218
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,860
 [Ghost]

1219
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,860
 [Ghost]

1220
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,860
 [Ghost]

1221
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:23,860
 [Ghost]

1222
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:30,860
 [Ghost]

1223
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:37,860
 [Ghost]

1224
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,860
 [Ghost]

1225
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,860
 Go! Go! Go!

1226
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:47,860
 Fight with the power of your heart

1227
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,860
 Go! Go! Go!

1228
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,860
 Make yourself proud

1229
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,860
 Go! Go! Go!

1230
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,860
 Let's dream

1231
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,860
 Go! Go! Go!

1232
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,860
 We will win
