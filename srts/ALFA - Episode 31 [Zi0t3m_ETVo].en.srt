 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Mission accomplished, sir

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Aldebaran finally believes in Leon

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I mean, your brionel, sir

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Good

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Now, your task is to fight that protective spirit

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 With a spell of torture

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Yes, a spell of torture

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 You beat the bad guys with a spell of torture, right?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 That's black magic, you know?

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Vega, usually you can make a spell

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Why are you a failure now?

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 A battle of courage and bravery

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Test, one, two, three, sir

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Test, Roger, Roger, sir

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 The result is here, sir

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 How's Leon's development there?

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Wow, it's amazing, sir

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Leon is now the smartest kid in the school

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 He even beat Vega, sir

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Hahaha

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Good job, sir

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But there's only one problem, sir

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Alva stole Leon, sir

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I'm worried that Alva can disrupt our plan, sir

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Alva

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000

 Alva

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 What's this, sir?

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Hahaha

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 That's my love potion, sir

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Whoever drinks this potion, he will be loyal and be with Leon

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Including Alva

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Wow, that's amazing, sir

 Leon

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 What's wrong with you?

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You're still a kid and you're sending letters?

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 You're so stupid

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 You're so stupid

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Shut up

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Learn from me, kid

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I'll give you a present

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I'll give you a present

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I'll give you a present

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I'll give you a present

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I'm not a kid anymore

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I'm not a kid anymore

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000

 Hey, there's a Lion

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 What's up?

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Do you miss us?

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Yes, we miss you

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Can I get closer to you?

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Yes, you can

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 We're going to have a party tonight

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Do you want to come?

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Yes, we do

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Okay, then you can tell the others

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Okay, kid

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 One more thing

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Don't tell the teacher

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Just a little

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 If the teacher knows, we'll be scolded

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Yes, of course

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Okay, just trust us

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Okay, thank you

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Hello, come here

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Come here

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Come here

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Okay, everyone

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 We're going to have a Valentine's Day party

 That's right

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But there's one condition

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Don't tell the teacher

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Okay

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Now, we're going to prepare

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 The Valentine's Day party

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 But don't tell anyone

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Okay

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Okay

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Just trust us

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Okay

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 [Valentine's Day]

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 [Valentine's Day]

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Did you buy the flowers?

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 No, I was given them

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Who did you give them to?

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Maria

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 She said she's sorry

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Because she cheated on me

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Oh, Maria

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 That's so sweet

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Maria, come to the party

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Come here

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Did you know?

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 She's going to have a midnight class

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Today?

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It must be fun

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Can we join?

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Of course

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Because she's going to invite all the students

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Don't tell the teacher

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 She might scold us

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Okay

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 [Valentine's Day]

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Are you going to the midnight class?

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 With Rio?

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I don't know

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I don't feel good with her

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Why?

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 You don't like her?

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 She's a good girl

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Right, Rita?

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Yes, she's a good girl

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Let's go together

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So you can get closer to her

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Good afternoon, Your Highness

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 How is it?

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Have you managed to get them?

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Of course, Your Highness

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 [The most beautiful moment]

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 This is it

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 This is it

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 This is impossible

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 This is impossible

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 How is it impossible?

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It's possible

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 The fabric is already touched by the queen

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 No one has ever dyed my fabric with blood

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And yet

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 You're still cheating

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Wait

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Queen

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 So

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 The queen wants us to die by dyeing this fabric?

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Of course

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 You all deserve to die

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Because you want to get the most valuable treasure in this world

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Guys, I can't wait for the midnight class

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Me too, Sis

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Me too, Sis

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Shh

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Don't make a noise, or the teacher will laugh at us

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 You're my sister

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 You're so annoying

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Now, let's divide the tasks

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Rita, Pega

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Prepare the food

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Yes

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 We're the sexy decoration

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Because we're sexy

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Smart, my sister

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Okay

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Okay, you're the sexy decoration

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Ray and I will prepare the drinks

212
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Okay

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 What are we doing?

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 You're the satbang

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Alpah, your task is to wake up the other students

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's 11 PM

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 What do you think?

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Are you sure that there will be a party at 11 PM?

219
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Of course, Alpah

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 But Ray, our school was just attacked by the labah-labah

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Without the teacher's knowledge

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's very dangerous

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 What if something happens?

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 You're paranoid, Alpah

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 The monster is dead

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 If it's still there, it's still on the beach

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 If the monster is still there, it will be still there

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 That's right

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 We're still here

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Hero is Rio

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Rio is my hero

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Rio Nelo Hero

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 What are you doing?

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 You're a scum

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 You're a monster

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 You're a monster

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 You're a monster

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 The two of you

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 You're wearing a skirt

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 The respected queen

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 The guardian has left

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Watch out

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 The teacher is here

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 The teacher is here

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 The teacher is here

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 The teacher is here

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 The teacher is here

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 The teacher is here

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 The teacher is here

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 The teacher is here

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 The teacher is here

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 The teacher is here

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 The teacher is here

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 You missed

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 You missed

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 The teacher is here

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 The teacher is here

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 There's a stone in the grave

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 The queen has escaped

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Let's go

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Wait

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It's okay

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Mik, the army

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 We must hold on

265
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Hang in there

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Why is the lollipop here?

267
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It's just there

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I forgot

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 This lollipop is broken because I used a magic to open it

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 I must throw it

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 The lollipop fell

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'll throw it

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 The lollipop is holding the queen's lollipop

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Good, the lollipop is smart

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 It can save itself

276
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 What are they doing?

277
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I won't let you go

278
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Let me go

279
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 If you don't let me go, I'll force you

280
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Try it if you can

281
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 All creatures have weak spots

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 They are in the neck, waist, and feet

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 The queen is in the neck

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 The queen is in the head

285
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 What are you doing?

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Why can't you move?

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I'm the queen's guardian

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 So, I can't move

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Why can't the queen's guardian move?

290
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 What are you doing here?

291
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 The queen is in the neck

292
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 The queen is in the neck

293
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 What should we do?

294
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Wait

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Check, test 1, 2, 3

296
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Hotel?

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 My dear hotel

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 The hotel is broken

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Hotel, come here right now

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Help Nick, don't let him fall

301
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Hurry, help him

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Come on, Nick

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Don't give up, Nick

304
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 My dear hotel

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 You're safe, Nick

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 What's going on?

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Why can't I move?

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Help

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Please, don't let me go

310
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 If you want to give me the necklace

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 I'll lock the queen again

312
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I don't want to be taught

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 What are you doing?

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I'll lock the queen so she can't fly

315
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Then, she'll fall down

316
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And her beautiful face will be sucked by the rock

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Do you want to be ugly?

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 No, I don't want to be ugly

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Give me the necklace now

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Okay

321
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 You're so annoying

322
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 I'll lock the queen

323
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Please, Nick

324
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I don't want to be taught

325
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I'll lock the queen

326
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I don't want to be taught

327
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I'll lock the queen

328
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I don't want to be taught

329
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I'll lock the queen

330
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I don't want to be taught

331
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I'll lock the queen

332
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I don't want to be taught

333
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I'll lock the queen

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I don't want to be taught

335
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 That's weird

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Why is everyone suspicious of me?

337
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 I thought I was the one who's suspicious

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I should ask Panji

339
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I'll be in trouble if I tell them

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I've been given a present by Panji

341
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Peta, yes

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 He said it's a gift from God

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Let's go

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Why is there a school?

345
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 It's so crowded

346
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 There are so many people walking around the school

347
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I'm so proud

348
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I'm going to the hospital

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Why is there a sign saying "Prosangkara"?

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Ryo is following me

351
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I don't know where he is

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Ryo is following me in the dark

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Where is he going?

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I have to go there

355
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 What are you doing?

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 This is a gift from God

357
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Ryo, I'm sorry

358
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 What's wrong?

359
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Who were you with?

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I was with a stranger

361
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I'm alone here

362
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 What do you want?

363
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Nothing

364
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I don't need anything

365
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I'm going

366
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 I don't feel good

367
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Maybe

368
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Professor Angkari is going to be a good person

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Maybe

370
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Prosangkara is going to be Ryo

371
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I don't think so

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 I have to give him the top vega and other things

373
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 So, they'll be aware

374
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I think Alva is going to be suspicious

375
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Calm down, Leon

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 He's going to be the guard of the 8th prince

377
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 He's going to be the guard of the 8th prince

378
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

379
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

380
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

381
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

382
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

383
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 He's going to be the guard of the 8th prince

384
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 It's good

385
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I'm going to make a cake

386
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Our cake

387
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 You can make it

388
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You can choose

389
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Why are you making a surprise?

390
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 You must be waiting for someone else

391
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 You want to taste our cake

392
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Yes

393
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I have an important news for you

394
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 What news?

395
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 This news

396
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 The guard is coming

397
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 We can't tell anyone

398
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 There will be a problem

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Let's hide

400
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Come here

401
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Hide me first

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He's running away

403
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

404
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It's safe

405
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 But I'm curious

406
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Who dares to come in here

407
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And do all of this

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Whoever it is

409
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 This person is too much

410
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Lack of work

411
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Annoying and useless

412
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 He's here

413
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 You're under arrest

414
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I'm not

415
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I heard that noise

416
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 From here

417
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 But it's weird

418
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 There's no one here

419
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 My food is running out

420
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 It's running out

421
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 The 8th prince

422
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Or maybe

423
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 This is Angkara's doing

424
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 He's doing all of this to take revenge on me

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 I'm going to look for the key

426
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I'm going to the kitchen

427
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 This way

428
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Let's go

429
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 From here to Angkara

430
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Let's go to the kitchen

431
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Let's go to Angkara

432
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Let's go to the kitchen

433
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 There he is

434
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 There he is

435
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Weird

436
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 But there's a writing in the wall

437
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 But he's just acting

438
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So suspicious

439
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So suspicious

440
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 He's coming

441
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He's coming

442
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Wait here

443
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I'll go in

444
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So you can be safe

445
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 If I pass by

446
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 You tell me

447
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 So suspicious

448
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Why did he tell me to watch over there?

449
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 What is he doing in there?

450
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Bofo

451
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 What's that?

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It's safe

453
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 It's time for me to wait

454
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 What are you doing in there?

455
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Why are you here?

456
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I've been following you

457
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And now I want to know

458
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 What are you hiding in there?

459
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 I'm not hiding anything

460
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Don't lie

461
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 I saw something

462
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And you

463
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 You're not hiding anything

464
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I'm not hiding anything

465
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 I'm not hiding anything

466
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I'm not hiding anything

467
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And you

468
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 You're hiding something

469
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 What is it?

470
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Answer me

471
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I don't understand

472
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 What do you mean?

473
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I'll check it myself

474
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Don't

475
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Why not?

476
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Because I didn't put anything in there

477
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 I don't believe you

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I'll check it myself

479
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Don't

480
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 What are you?

481
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 What are you doing in there?

482
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Why are you stopping me?

483
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I'm stopping you

484
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Because I'm afraid you'll ruin this drink

485
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Now you better get out

486
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 If not, what are you going to do?

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 What are you going to do?

488
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 I'll kill you

489
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I'll kill you

490
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 I'll kill you

491
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 I'll kill you

492
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 I'll kill you

493
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Don't drink it

494
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Don't

495
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Rey

496
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Rey

497
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Rey

498
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Rey

499
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Rey

500
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Rey

501
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Rey

502
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Rey

503
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Rey

504
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Okay

505
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Starting tonight

506
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I'll stay here

507
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I won't sleep

508
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I won't sleep

509
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I'll investigate

510
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Who is this person

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 If that person is you

512
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 I'll kill him

513
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 I'll kill him

514
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Alpha

515
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 What are you doing here?

516
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Rey

517
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 But Rey

518
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 I just want to protect you all

519
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 He's evil

520
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 He's evil

521
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 He's the one who put the poison in the drink

522
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It's a lie

523
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 He's lying

524
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 It's true

525
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 I'm confused

526
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I just want to protect you all

527
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Because

528
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Rion put the poison in the drink

529
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 It's a lie

530
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 It's true

531
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 It's true

532
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 If you want to know if it's true or a lie

533
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Try this drink

534
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 No Rey

535
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 It's a poison

536
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 You'll die

537
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Come on Rey

538
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 You'll know who's right or wrong

539
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Don't Rey

540
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Don't drink it

541
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Don't Rey

542
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Rey

543
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Rey

544
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Rey

545
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Rey

546
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Rey

547
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Rey

548
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Rey

549
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Rey

550
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Don't drink it

551
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Let me go

552
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 What are you doing?

553
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 The drink doesn't have poison

554
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I'm fine

555
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 You're the one who's evil

556
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 You've been eating this

557
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And you

558
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 You hurt my friend

559
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 My best friend

560
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Rey

561
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Rey

562
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Hi everyone

563
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I'm sorry

564
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I think

565
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 The party tonight was a failure

566
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Why?

567
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Why?

568
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Why?

569
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Because

570
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 The cake and the drink

571
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Are ruined

572
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Ruined

573
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 The party is ruined because of Alva

574
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 She ruined our party

575
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Who's Alva?

576
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 She's a jerk

577
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 She'll beat up the kids

578
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Beat up the kids?

579
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Let's make a gang

580
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Let's make a gang

581
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Rey, do you feel weird?

582
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 With Sira

583
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Why?

584
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 You don't see it

585
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Usually she's not that angry

586
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 With Alva

587
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I don't know

588
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 What's wrong with her?

589
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Why is Rey like that?

590
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 It's weird that she's mad at me

591
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 It must be because of Sirio

592
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I'll show her

593
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 I'll reveal her secret

594
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 I'll show her

595
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 What's wrong?

596
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Weird

597
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 What's wrong?

598
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 That's a punishment for you Alva

599
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Because you made a mess

600
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 What's going on?

601
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Is this a prank?

602
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 We've decided

603
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 For a month

604
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 We'll be your friends

605
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Why me?

606
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Because you ruined our party

607
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Let's go

608
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Poor Alva

609
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Actually we don't know

610
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 What's wrong

611
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 With Alva or Sirio

612
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Me too

613
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 This must be Ryo's doing

614
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Ryo must be

615
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Making them to blame me

616
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Ryo is evil

617
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Evil?

618
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 It's hot

619
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Riding a pony and a giraffe

620
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 It's obvious

621
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 I think

622
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 We're going to lose

623
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Don't underestimate us

624
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 It's obvious

625
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 We're going to lose

626
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 We're going to lose

627
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 We're going to lose

628
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 You're the one who's been coming

629
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Oh my god

630
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 What should we do?

631
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It doesn't mean we're going to lose

632
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Nik

633
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 What should we do?

634
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Sorry guys

635
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 I failed

636
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 All the efforts we've done

637
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 It's a waste

638
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 I'm sorry

639
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 You're being cheated on

640
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Stay calm

641
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 I lied

642
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 I won

643
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 I won

644
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Don't be so arrogant

645
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 You're going to ruin the equipment

646
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Don't you believe I won?

647
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 You won, Nik

648
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 You got a prize

649
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 You got it

650
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Yeah

651
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Last star

652
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Alif Ba

653
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Nik, come here

654
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 Let me use this

655
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Don't touch it

656
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 If it falls

657
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Into the hands of evil people

658
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 It can be dangerous

659
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 I'd better use it

660
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Sorry, soldier

661
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 With all my heart

662
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 It's not suitable for a soldier

663
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Right, friend?

664
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 It's a girl's dress

665
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 But look

666
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 It's suitable

667
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 Here

668
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 I'd better use it

669
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Rather than

670
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Being stolen

671
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 It's more dangerous

672
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Than being stolen

673
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 Do you understand?

674
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 We have to save this

675
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 It's hard to get

676
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Finally

677
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 We got the soul stone

678
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 We got it

679
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 You're being cheated on

680
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 A lot

681
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Kids

682
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 It's time to go home

683
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Okay, soldier

684
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Do you know

685
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 You're all

686
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Super stupid

687
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 You got

688
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 One of these

689
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 It's hard to ask for forgiveness

690
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 They say, last star is a boy

691
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 A magic school kid

692
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Where is it?

693
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Come on

694
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Let's go home

695
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 It's getting late

696
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Let's go

697
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Alva

698
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 What?

699
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 You want to scold me?

700
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 No, we don't

701
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Whatever

702
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 We're still friends

703
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 But you have to believe

704
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 I'm not wrong

705
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Do you believe me?

706
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 If you don't, it's okay

707
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Okay

708
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 It's okay

709
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 I have proof

710
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Riaw is evil

711
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 She's in a group with Professor Angkara

712
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 The school

713
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 The school

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 The school

715
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 The school

716
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 The school

717
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 What's that?

718
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 This is the school map

719
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 I gave it to Mr. Panji

720
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 That time

721
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Everyone here

722
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Will see it

723
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Let's open it

724
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 The map is cool

725
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Cool, right?

726
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Here

727
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 I'll tell you where Riaw is

728
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 You'll see

729
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 She's always with Professor Angkara

730
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 Where is it?

731
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Here it is

732
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Where is Professor Angkara?

733
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 That's Riaw, Karen, and the others

734
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 She's always with Professor Angkara

735
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 But she's not here

736
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 That's weird

737
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Why is she alone?

738
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Where is Professor Angkara?

739
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 Maybe she's tired

740
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 She should rest

741
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Maybe she's missing her parents

742
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 That's why she's in a bad mood

743
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Maybe she's tired

744
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 She should rest

745
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 Maybe she's missing her parents

746
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 That's why she's in a bad mood

747
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Maybe she's tired

748
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Maybe she's missing her parents

749
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 That's why she's in a bad mood

750
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 We can do it

751
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 We can do it

752
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 We can do it

753
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 We can do it

754
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 We can do it

755
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 We can do it

756
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 We can do it

757
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 We can do it

758
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 We can do it

759
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 To the city of Malang

760
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 And then to the city of Perapan

761
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Let's go home

762
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Let's go

763
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 You'll get mad

764
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 One

765
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Two

766
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Three

767
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 This is our last chance

768
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 We have to protect her

769
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Don't let her get hurt

770
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 We hope we can get to school

771
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 So she can go home safely

772
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Amen

773
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 You're such a jerk

774
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Let's go home

775
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Let's go

776
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 What should we do?

777
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 One, two, three, go

778
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 To the city of Perapan

779
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Alright

780
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 With this coffee

781
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 I'll be safe

782
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 Until the next three days

783
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 So I won't be in Malang

784
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 There's no one here

785
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 This must be the same person

786
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 This is the same person

787
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 He's playing with me

788
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 Continue drinking your coffee

789
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 It's so enjoyable at night

790
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 So enjoyable

791
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 (Sleeping)

792
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 I'm sleepy

793
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Are you sleepy?

794
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 No, I'm not

795
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 You can't be sleepy

796
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 Open your eyes

797
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 You can't sleep

798
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 You can't sleep

799
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 You can't sleep

800
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 You can't sleep

801
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Can't sleep

802
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 (The next day)

803
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 Come on, kids

804
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Let's make the school beautiful

805
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 Put the flowers there

806
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 How beautiful it is

807
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 When the world is full of love

808
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Wow

809
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Love with a smile

810

 My kids

811
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Who likes brown?

812
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Yes

813
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Come on, come here

814
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 This is the brown

815
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 We'll divide it one by one

816
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 The contents

817
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 We won't divide it, we'll open it

818
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 But we'll give it to the friends

819
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 Happy Valentine's Day

820
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 I hope our day is filled with love

821
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Open it

822
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Thank you, professor

823
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 The brown

824
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Makes us love each other more

825
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000

 Thank you, kids

828
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Thank you, professor

829
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Happy Valentine's Day

830
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 Sorry

831
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 I don't celebrate Valentine's Day

832
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 So you just keep your advice

833
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 Because it won't be useful for me

834
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Do you understand?

835
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 Why don't you celebrate it?

836
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 Because professor Purwa is single

837
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 Shut up

838
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 Where's Alfa?

839
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 I don't know, professor

840
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 I don't know where Alfa is

841
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 Maybe Alfa is single

842
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 Because he lost to Ria

843
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Yes, professor

844
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 Alfa is just a story

845
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 He likes to be single

846
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 And he's single

847
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 He's single

848
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 He's single

849
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 He's single

850
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 Is that true?

851
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 Yes, it's true

852
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 I must have lost to them

853
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 That's why I like to think weird

854
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 If I meet them

855
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 I'll be happy

856
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 I need to think about Ria

857
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 And my parents

858
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Alright

859
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 Now we'll learn Mantra

860
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Mantra

861
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 Mantra

862
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 I'll introduce

863
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 Mantra Sevenka

864
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Who can answer?

865
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 What's the Mantra?

866
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 Rio

867
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 If you use this Mantra

868
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 An enemy will appear

869
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 And the enemy will fall

870
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 If you don't understand the Mantra

871
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 But the answer is easy

872
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Good

873
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 Now

874
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 We'll try this Mantra together

875
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 I must fail to other students

876
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 So that Rio will be number one

877
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000

 I can

882
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 I can!

883
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000

 Lita

885
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 The Mantra is Sevenka

886

 Not Sevenka

887
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000

 What is it, Professor?

921

01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 He's so suspicious

1170
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 Of them

1171
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000

1172
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 Thank you

1173
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 You're the one who saved me

1174
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
 Where are you?

1177
01:03:42,000 --> 01:04:02,000
 I'm suspicious

1178
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
 If all of this is a fabrication

1179

 [Music]

1182
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 Who did this?

1183
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 Alva

1184
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 I did it

1185
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
 It's okay

1186
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 I'm sorry

1187
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 I attacked you

1188
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 Why did you attack me?

1189
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 Because I thought you're a spy

1190
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 A spy?

1191
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
 Yes

1192
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
 For the past few days

1193
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 There's been

1194
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 What is this?

1195
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 There's blood

1196
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
 Flowers

1197
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 Everywhere

1198
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
 It's too much

1199
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
 Too much

1200
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 It turns out that person

1201
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
 Still dare to come here

1202
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
 Mr. Paji, actually

1203
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 Who did this?

1204
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
 I don't know

1205
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
 Before

1206
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 I already

1207
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 Wanted to stay here

1208
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 But I don't know

1209
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 Why I suddenly fainted

1210
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 And I fell asleep in the room

1211
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 I'm surprised

1212
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 Before

1213
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
 I drank coffee

1214
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
 My favorite coffee, Alva

1215
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 But why

1216
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 I can fall asleep

1217
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 Alva, this is a child

1218
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 A child?

1219
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
 Yes, a child

1220
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 Impossible

1221
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 Alva, because he has

1222
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 Very high knowledge

1223
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 Before

1224
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 He also succeeded in picking up

1225
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 The password I made to protect this tomb

1226
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
 Alva, so it's impossible

1227
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
 He did it, or the child did it

1228
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
 I'm suspicious

1229
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 If all of this

1230
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 Is a child's doing

1231
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 Yes, sir

1232
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
 This is also my purpose to come here

1233
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 Besides I miss

1234
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 My parents

1235
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
 I want to talk about the prosperity of Angkara

1236
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
 What is it, Alva?

1237
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 Did Angkara make a child again from school?

1238
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
 The child is a child

1239
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 The child is a child

1240
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
 The child is a child

1241
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 The child is a child

1242
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
 The child is a child

1243
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 Rio is so cool, she gave us chocolate

1244
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 It's delicious

1245
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 Rio is our true leader

1246
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 Yes, I will follow her forever

1247
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
 Live, Rio

1248
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 Live, Rio

1249
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 Live, Rio

1250
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 Live, Rio

1251
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 Live, Rio

1252
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
 Let's try, Miss

1253
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 If we

1254
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 Keep on loving this heart

1255
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 Yes, our heart will be happy

1256
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 Always happy

1257
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
 Chocolate makes you happy

1258
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 Wait a minute

1259
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
 That's smart

1260
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 Miss, I don't want to

1261
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 Be friends with Alva

1262
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Rio is our new leader

1263
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 Because the one who is evil

1264
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 Is only Rio

1265
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 That's right

1266
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 That's right

1267
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 Where is Rio?

1268
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 Alva

1269
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
 Where is Alva?

1270
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 Classroom is not here

1271
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 Where is Alva?

1272
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 Alva

1273
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 Alva

1274
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 Alva

1275
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 I better look here

1276
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
 Where is it?

1277
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:24,000
 This is

1278
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 Why is Rio's name

1279
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 So similar to Professor Rangkara?

1280
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
 Maybe

1281
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 Alva is right

1282
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 What else can Professor Rangkara and Rio do?

1283
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
 In the toilet

1284
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 Don't use it

1285
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 Don't use it

1286
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 Here, I want to show you

1287
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 Where is the map?

1288
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 I left it

1289
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
 I want to show you

1290
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 Show me what?

1291
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 Maybe

1292
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
 The map you gave me

1293
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 Is broken

1294
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 You mean?

1295
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 Because there is Professor Rangkara

1296
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 And he always

1297
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 Have a fight with his new kid

1298
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 His name is Rio

1299
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 That means

1300
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 There is Rangkara near Rio

1301
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 There

1302
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 There

1303
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 I'm going to kill you

1304
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
 I'm going to kill you

1305
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
 Rio

1306
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
 What are you doing?

1307
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 Professor

1308
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 Professor

1309
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
 It's a disaster

1310
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 It's a disaster

1311
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
 Rio, why did you do that?

1312
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
 Rio, why did you do that?

1313
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 Show your spirit

1314
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 Get ready, my friend

1315
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 Run, jump,

1316
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
 Jump, and get the stars

1317
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 Be brave

1318
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
 Don't give up

1319
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
 Chase your dreams

1320
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
 Go, go, go

1321
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
 Achieve all your dreams

1322
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
 Go, go, go

1323
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
 Never stop

1324
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 Go, go, go

1325
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 Fight with your heart

1326
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 Go, go, go

1327
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
 Make yourself proud

1328
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
 Go, go, go

1329
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 Let's dream

1330
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
 Go, go, go

1331
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 We will
