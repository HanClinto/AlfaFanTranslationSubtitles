00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, run with courage

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Mission accomplished, sir

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Aldebaran finally believes in Leon

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I mean, your brionel, sir

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, your task is to fight that protective spirit

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
With a spell of torture

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, a spell of torture

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You beat the bad guys with a spell of torture, right?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's black magic, you know?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Vega, usually you can make a spell

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why are you a failure now?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:26,000
A battle of courage and bravery

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Test, one, two, three, sir

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Test, Roger, Roger, sir

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The result is here, sir

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How's Leon's development there?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wow, it's amazing, sir

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Leon is now the smartest kid in the school

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He even beat Vega, sir

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hahaha

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Good job, sir

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But there's only one problem, sir

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Alva stole Leon, sir

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm worried that Alva can disrupt our plan, sir

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alva

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's this, sir?

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hahaha

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's my love potion, sir

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Whoever drinks this potion, he will be loyal and be with Leon

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Including Alva

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wow, that's amazing, sir

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hahaha

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
To be continued...

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Vega

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Leon

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's wrong with you?

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're still a kid and you're sending letters?

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're so stupid

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Shut up

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Learn from me, kid

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll give you a present

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not a kid anymore

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey, there's a Lion

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What's up?

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you miss us?

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, we miss you

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Can I get closer to you?

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes, you can

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We're going to have a party tonight

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you want to come?

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, we do

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, then you can tell the others

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, kid

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
One more thing

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't tell the teacher

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Just a little

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If the teacher knows, we'll be scolded

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, of course

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, just trust us

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, thank you

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hello, come here

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Come here

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, everyone

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're going to have a Valentine's Day party

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's right

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But there's one condition

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't tell the teacher

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Now, we're going to prepare

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The Valentine's Day party

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But don't tell anyone

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Just trust us

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[Valentine's Day]

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Did you buy the flowers?

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, I was given them

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Who did you give them to?

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Maria

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She said she's sorry

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Because she cheated on me

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, Maria

94
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's so sweet

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Maria, come to the party

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Come here

97
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Did you know?

98
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
She's going to have a midnight class

99
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Today?

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It must be fun

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Can we join?

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of course

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because she's going to invite all the students

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't tell the teacher

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
She might scold us

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
[Valentine's Day]

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you going to the midnight class?

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
With Rio?

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know

111
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't feel good with her

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't like her?

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's a good girl

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Right, Rita?

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, she's a good girl

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's go together

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So you can get closer to her

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Good afternoon, Your Highness

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
How is it?

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Have you managed to get them?

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Of course, Your Highness

123
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
[The most beautiful moment]

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This is it

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is impossible

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How is it impossible?

127
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's possible

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The fabric is already touched by the queen

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No one has ever dyed my fabric with blood

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And yet

131
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're still cheating

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Wait

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Queen

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The queen wants us to die by dyeing this fabric?

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Of course

137
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You all deserve to die

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because you want to get the most valuable treasure in this world

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Guys, I can't wait for the midnight class

140
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Me too, Sis

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Shh

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't make a noise, or the teacher will laugh at us

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're my sister

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're so annoying

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now, let's divide the tasks

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Rita, Pega

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Prepare the food

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We're the sexy decoration

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Because we're sexy

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Smart, my sister

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, you're the sexy decoration

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Ray and I will prepare the drinks

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What are we doing?

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're the satbang

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Alpah, your task is to wake up the other students

159
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's 11 PM

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you think?

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you sure that there will be a party at 11 PM?

162
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Of course, Alpah

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But Ray, our school was just attacked by the labah-labah

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Without the teacher's knowledge

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's very dangerous

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What if something happens?

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're paranoid, Alpah

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The monster is dead

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If it's still there, it's still on the beach

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If the monster is still there, it will be still there

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's right

172
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We're still here

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Hero is Rio

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Rio is my hero

175
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Rio Nelo Hero

176
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you doing?

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're a scum

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're a monster

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The two of you

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're wearing a skirt

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The respected queen

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The guardian has left

183
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Watch out

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The teacher is here

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You missed

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The teacher is here

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There's a stone in the grave

188
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The queen has escaped

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's go

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Wait

191
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's okay

192
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mik, the army

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We must hold on

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hang in there

195
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why is the lollipop here?

196
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's just there

197
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I forgot

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This lollipop is broken because I used a magic to open it

199
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I must throw it

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The lollipop fell

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll throw it

202
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The lollipop is holding the queen's lollipop

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Good, the lollipop is smart

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It can save itself

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What are they doing?

206
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I won't let you go

207
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let me go

208
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you don't let me go, I'll force you

209
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Try it if you can

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:48,000
All creatures have weak spots

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
They are in the neck, waist, and feet

212
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The queen is in the neck

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The queen is in the head

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What are you doing?

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why can't you move?

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm the queen's guardian

217
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, I can't move

218
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why can't the queen's guardian move?

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What are you doing here?

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The queen is in the neck

221
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What should we do?

222
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Wait

223
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Check, test 1, 2, 3

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Hotel?

225
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
My dear hotel

226
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The hotel is broken

227
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hotel, come here right now

228
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Help Nick, don't let him fall

229
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hurry, help him

230
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Come on, Nick

231
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't give up, Nick

232
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
My dear hotel

233
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're safe, Nick

234
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What's going on?

235
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why can't I move?

236
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Help

237
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Please, don't let me go

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If you want to give me the necklace

239
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll lock the queen again

240
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't want to be taught

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What are you doing?

242
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll lock the queen so she can't fly

243
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Then, she'll fall down

244
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And her beautiful face will be sucked by the rock

245
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you want to be ugly?

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, I don't want to be ugly

247
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Give me the necklace now

248
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay

249
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're so annoying

250
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll lock the queen

251
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Please, Nick

252
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't want to be taught

253
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll lock the queen

254
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't want to be taught

255
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll lock the queen

256
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't want to be taught

257
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll lock the queen

258
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't want to be taught

259
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll lock the queen

260
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't want to be taught

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll lock the queen

262
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't want to be taught

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's weird

264
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why is everyone suspicious of me?

265
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I thought I was the one who's suspicious

266
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I should ask Panji

267
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll be in trouble if I tell them

268
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I've been given a present by Panji

269
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Peta, yes

270
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He said it's a gift from God

271
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's go

272
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why is there a school?

273
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's so crowded

274
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There are so many people walking around the school

275
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm so proud

276
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm going to the hospital

277
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why is there a sign saying "Prosangkara"?

278
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Ryo is following me

279
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't know where he is

280
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Ryo is following me in the dark

281
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Where is he going?

282
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I have to go there

283
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you doing?

284
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is a gift from God

285
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ryo, I'm sorry

286
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What's wrong?

287
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Who were you with?

288
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was with a stranger

289
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm alone here

290
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What do you want?

291
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Nothing

292
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't need anything

293
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm going

294
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't feel good

295
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Maybe

296
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Professor Angkari is going to be a good person

297
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe

298
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Prosangkara is going to be Ryo

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't think so

300
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I have to give him the top vega and other things

301
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So, they'll be aware

302
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think Alva is going to be suspicious

303
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Calm down, Leon

304
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He's going to be the guard of the 8th prince

305
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

306
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He's going to be the guard of the 8th prince

307
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's good

308
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm going to make a cake

309
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Our cake

310
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You can make it

311
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You can choose

312
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Why are you making a surprise?

313
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You must be waiting for someone else

314
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You want to taste our cake

315
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes

316
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I have an important news for you

317
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What news?

318
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This news

319
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The guard is coming

320
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
We can't tell anyone

321
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There will be a problem

322
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Let's hide

323
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Come here

324
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Hide me first

325
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He's running away

326
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

327
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's safe

328
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But I'm curious

329
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Who dares to come in here

330
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And do all of this

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Whoever it is

332
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
This person is too much

333
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Lack of work

334
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Annoying and useless

335
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He's here

336
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You're under arrest

337
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm not

338
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I heard that noise

339
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
From here

340
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But it's weird

341
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There's no one here

342
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:15,000
My food is running out

343
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's running out

344
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The 8th prince

345
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Or maybe

346
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is Angkara's doing

347
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He's doing all of this to take revenge on me

348
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm going to look for the key

349
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm going to the kitchen

350
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This way

351
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Let's go

352
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
From here to Angkara

353
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Let's go to the kitchen

354
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Let's go to Angkara

355
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's go to the kitchen

356
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There he is

357
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Weird

358
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But there's a writing in the wall

359
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But he's just acting

360
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So suspicious

361
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He's coming

362
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Wait here

363
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll go in

364
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So you can be safe

365
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
If I pass by

366
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You tell me

367
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So suspicious

368
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Why did he tell me to watch over there?

369
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What is he doing in there?

370
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Bofo

371
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What's that?

372
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's safe

373
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's time for me to wait

374
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
What are you doing in there?

375
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Why are you here?

376
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I've been following you

377
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And now I want to know

378
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What are you hiding in there?

379
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm not hiding anything

380
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't lie

381
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I saw something

382
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And you

383
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You're not hiding anything

384
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm not hiding anything

385
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And you

386
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You're hiding something

387
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What is it?

388
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Answer me

389
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't understand

390
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
What do you mean?

391
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'll check it myself

392
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Don't

393
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Why not?

394
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Because I didn't put anything in there

395
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I don't believe you

396
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll check it myself

397
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Don't

398
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What are you?

399
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What are you doing in there?

400
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Why are you stopping me?

401
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm stopping you

402
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Because I'm afraid you'll ruin this drink

403
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now you better get out

404
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If not, what are you going to do?

405
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What are you going to do?

406
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'll kill you

407
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Don't drink it

408
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't

409
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Rey

410
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Okay

411
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Starting tonight

412
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'll stay here

413
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I won't sleep

414
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll investigate

415
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Who is this person

416
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
If that person is you

417
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll kill him

418
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Alpha

419
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What are you doing here?

420
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Rey

421
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But Rey

422
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I just want to protect you all

423
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
He's evil

424
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He's the one who put the poison in the drink

425
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's a lie

426
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
He's lying

427
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's true

428
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm confused

429
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I just want to protect you all

430
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Because

431
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Rion put the poison in the drink

432
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's a lie

433
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's true

434
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If you want to know if it's true or a lie

435
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Try this drink

436
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No Rey

437
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's a poison

438
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You'll die

439
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Come on Rey

440
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You'll know who's right or wrong

441
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Don't Rey

442
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Don't drink it

443
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Don't Rey

444
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Rey

445
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Don't drink it

446
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Let me go

447
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What are you doing?

448
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The drink doesn't have poison

449
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm fine

450
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You're the one who's evil

451
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You've been eating this

452
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And you

453
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You hurt my friend

454
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
My best friend

455
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Rey

456
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Hi everyone

457
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry

458
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I think

459
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The party tonight was a failure

460
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Why?

461
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because

462
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The cake and the drink

463
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Are ruined

464
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Ruined

465
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The party is ruined because of Alva

466
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
She ruined our party

467
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Who's Alva?

468
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
She's a jerk

469
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
She'll beat up the kids

470
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Beat up the kids?

471
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Let's make a gang

472
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Rey, do you feel weird?

473
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
With Sira

474
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Why?

475
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You don't see it

476
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Usually she's not that angry

477
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
With Alva

478
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I don't know

479
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What's wrong with her?

480
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Why is Rey like that?

481
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's weird that she's mad at me

482
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It must be because of Sirio

483
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'll show her

484
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'll reveal her secret

485
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'll show her

486
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What's wrong?

487
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Weird

488
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What's wrong?

489
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's a punishment for you Alva

490
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Because you made a mess

491
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
What's going on?

492
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Is this a prank?

493
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We've decided

494
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
For a month

495
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We'll be your friends

496
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Why me?

497
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because you ruined our party

498
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's go

499
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Poor Alva

500
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Actually we don't know

501
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What's wrong

502
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
With Alva or Sirio

503
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Me too

504
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This must be Ryo's doing

505
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Ryo must be

506
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Making them to blame me

507
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Ryo is evil

508
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Evil?

509
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's hot

510
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Riding a pony and a giraffe

511
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's obvious

512
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I think

513
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
We're going to lose

514
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Don't underestimate us

515
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's obvious

516
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
We're going to lose

517
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You're the one who's been coming

518
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh my god

519
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
What should we do?

520
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It doesn't mean we're going to lose

521
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Nik

522
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What should we do?

523
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Sorry guys

524
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I failed

525
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
All the efforts we've done

526
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's a waste

527
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm sorry

528
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You're being cheated on

529
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Stay calm

530
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I lied

531
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I won

532
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Don't be so arrogant

533
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You're going to ruin the equipment

534
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Don't you believe I won?

535
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You won, Nik

536
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You got a prize

537
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You got it

538
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah

539
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Last star

540
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Alif Ba

541
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Nik, come here

542
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Let me use this

543
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Don't touch it

544
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If it falls

545
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Into the hands of evil people

546
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It can be dangerous

547
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'd better use it

548
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Sorry, soldier

549
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
With all my heart

550
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's not suitable for a soldier

551
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Right, friend?

552
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's a girl's dress

553
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But look

554
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's suitable

555
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Here

556
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'd better use it

557
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Rather than

558
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Being stolen

559
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's more dangerous

560
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Than being stolen

561
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Do you understand?

562
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We have to save this

563
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's hard to get

564
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Finally

565
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
We got the soul stone

566
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We got it

567
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You're being cheated on

568
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
A lot

569
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Kids

570
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's time to go home

571
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Okay, soldier

572
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Do you know

573
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You're all

574
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Super stupid

575
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You got

576
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
One of these

577
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's hard to ask for forgiveness

578
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They say, last star is a boy

579
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
A magic school kid

580
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Where is it?

581
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Come on

582
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Let's go home

583
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's getting late

584
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Let's go

585
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Alva

586
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What?

587
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You want to scold me?

588
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No, we don't

589
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Whatever

590
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We're still friends

591
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But you have to believe

592
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm not wrong

593
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Do you believe me?

594
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
If you don't, it's okay

595
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Okay

596
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's okay

597
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I have proof

598
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Riaw is evil

599
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
She's in a group with Professor Angkara

600
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The school

601
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What's that?

602
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
This is the school map

603
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I gave it to Mr. Panji

604
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That time

605
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Everyone here

606
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Will see it

607
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Let's open it

608
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The map is cool

609
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Cool, right?

610
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Here

611
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'll tell you where Riaw is

612
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You'll see

613
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
She's always with Professor Angkara

614
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Where is it?

615
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Here it is

616
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Where is Professor Angkara?

617
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That's Riaw, Karen, and the others

618
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:06,000
She's always with Professor Angkara

619
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But she's not here

620
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That's weird

621
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Why is she alone?

622
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Where is Professor Angkara?

623
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Maybe she's tired

624
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
She should rest

625
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Maybe she's missing her parents

626
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's why she's in a bad mood

627
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Maybe she's tired

628
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
She should rest

629
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Maybe she's missing her parents

630
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That's why she's in a bad mood

631
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe she's tired

632
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Maybe she's missing her parents

633
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That's why she's in a bad mood

634
00:43:36,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We can do it

635
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
To the city of Malang

636
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And then to the city of Perapan

637
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Let's go home

638
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Let's go

639
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You'll get mad

640
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
One

641
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Two

642
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Three

643
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This is our last chance

644
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
We have to protect her

645
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Don't let her get hurt

646
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We hope we can get to school

647
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So she can go home safely

648
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Amen

649
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You're such a jerk

650
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Let's go home

651
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Let's go

652
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What should we do?

653
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
One, two, three, go

654
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
To the city of Perapan

655
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Alright

656
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
With this coffee

657
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'll be safe

658
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Until the next three days

659
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So I won't be in Malang

660
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There's no one here

661
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This must be the same person

662
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This is the same person

663
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
He's playing with me

664
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Continue drinking your coffee

665
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's so enjoyable at night

666
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So enjoyable

667
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
(Sleeping)

668
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm sleepy

669
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Are you sleepy?

670
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No, I'm not

671
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You can't be sleepy

672
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Open your eyes

673
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You can't sleep

674
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Can't sleep

675
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
(The next day)

676
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Come on, kids

677
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Let's make the school beautiful

678
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Put the flowers there

679
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
How beautiful it is

680
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
When the world is full of love

681
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Wow

682

Who likes brown?

685
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yes

686
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Come on, come here

687
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
This is the brown

688
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
We'll divide it one by one

689
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
The contents

690
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
We won't divide it, we'll open it

691
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But we'll give it to the friends

692
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Happy Valentine's Day

693
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I hope our day is filled with love

694
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Open it

695
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Thank you, professor

696
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The brown

697
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Makes us love each other more

Thank you, kids

Happy Valentine's Day

Sorry

704
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't celebrate Valentine's Day

705
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So you just keep your advice

706
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because it won't be useful for me

707
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Do you understand?

708
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Why don't you celebrate it?

709
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Because professor Purwa is single

710
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Shut up

711
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Where's Alfa?

712
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't know, professor

713
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't know where Alfa is

714
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Maybe Alfa is single

715
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Because he lost to Ria

716
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yes, professor

717
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Alfa is just a story

718
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
He likes to be single

719
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And he's single

720
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
He's single

721
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Is that true?

722
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yes, it's true

723
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I must have lost to them

724
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That's why I like to think weird

725
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
If I meet them

726
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'll be happy

727
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I need to think about Ria

728
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And my parents

729
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Alright

730

Mantra

732
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I'll introduce

735
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
What's the Mantra?

736
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Rio

737
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If you use this Mantra

738
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
An enemy will appear

739
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And the enemy will fall

740
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
If you don't understand the Mantra

741
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But the answer is easy

742
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Good

743
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Now

744
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
We'll try this Mantra together

745
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I must fail to other students

746
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
So that Rio will be number one

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
But you're useless soldiers

779
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Calm down, soldier

780
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Hit their tanks

781
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Come on, hit them

782
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Don't, soldier

783
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The car can be damaged, soldier

784
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Don't, soldier, we'll fall

785
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Hit them harder

786
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Don't, soldier

787
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Run

788
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Professor Aldebaran

789
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I have something to tell you

790
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
What is it, Professor?

791
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Alpha has dared to ask me

792
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
He's starting to rebel

793
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
How?

794
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Today, he's going to take my class

795
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Please

796
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Professor Aldebaran, give him a lesson

797
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm not a coward

798
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's not like usual

799
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Alpha makes a mistake

800
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Unless there's a clear reason

801
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes

802
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You should not defend him

803
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Keep your head down

804
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
He might grow up

805
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Like Gamma

806
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Professor Purwa, please

807
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
When you see Alpha

808
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Don't imagine Gamma

809
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But remember Akilah

810
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Akilah

811
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
If you're not married to Gamma

812
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You'll be there

813
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000

The door is locked

00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Maybe

822
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000

He usually does this

828
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Why is he doing this now?

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000

Because the party

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Failed today

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It's okay

As a request

I'm sorry

00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'll give you a present

Yes

By the way, this is a special gift

I'm not in the wrong

Why?

01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000

01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Not like Rio

976
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Why is he so like that?

977
01:01:48,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Ray, what's wrong with him?

978
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
He's so bad

979
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Alva is a bad person

980
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
But you're right

981
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Alva is a bad person

982
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He's always suspicious of Rio

983
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Even though Rio is a good person

984
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And handsome

985
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Why are you talking like that?

986
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Why?

987
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's not wrong to talk like that

988
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You're just following him

989
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You said Alva is a good person

990
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
But now you're changing

991
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Rio is a good person

992
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Not like Alva

993
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You're right

994
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That chocolate

995
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
There must be something

996
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
In that chocolate

997
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
That makes Prika change her mind

998
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Here's your chocolate

999
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Here

1000
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
What are you doing?

1001
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
That's my chocolate

1002
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I just want to see it

1003
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You can't

1004
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That's my chocolate

1005
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I don't want it

1006
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Let me see

1007
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Ouch

1008
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Let's go

1009
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Wait

1010
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Why is he like that?

1011
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
He's so suspicious

1012
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Of them

1013
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
[Music]

1014
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Thank you

1015
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You're the one who saved me

1016
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Where are you?

1017
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
[Music]

1018
01:03:42,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm suspicious

1019
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
If all of this is a fabrication

1020
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:18,000
[Music]

1021
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Who did this?

1022
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Alva

1023
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I did it

1024
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's okay

1025
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm sorry

1026
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I attacked you

1027
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Why did you attack me?

1028
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Because I thought you're a spy

1029
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
A spy?

1030
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yes

1031
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
For the past few days

1032
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
There's been

1033
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
What is this?

1034
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
There's blood

1035
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Flowers

1036
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Everywhere

1037
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
It's too much

1038
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Too much

1039
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It turns out that person

1040
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Still dare to come here

1041
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Mr. Paji, actually

1042
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Who did this?

1043
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I don't know

1044
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Before

1045
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I already

1046
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Wanted to stay here

1047
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But I don't know

1048
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Why I suddenly fainted

1049
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And I fell asleep in the room

1050
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm surprised

1051
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Before

1052
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I drank coffee

1053
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
My favorite coffee, Alva

1054
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
But why

1055
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I can fall asleep

1056
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Alva, this is a child

1057
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
A child?

1058
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yes, a child

1059
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Impossible

1060
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Alva, because he has

1061
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Very high knowledge

1062
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Before

1063
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
He also succeeded in picking up

1064
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
The password I made to protect this tomb

1065
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Alva, so it's impossible

1066
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
He did it, or the child did it

1067
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm suspicious

1068
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
If all of this

1069
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Is a child's doing

1070
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Yes, sir

1071
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
This is also my purpose to come here

1072
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Besides I miss

1073
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
My parents

1074
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I want to talk about the prosperity of Angkara

1075
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
What is it, Alva?

1076
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Did Angkara make a child again from school?

1077
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The child is a child

1078
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Rio is so cool, she gave us chocolate

1079
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's delicious

1080
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Rio is our true leader

1081
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Yes, I will follow her forever

1082
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Live, Rio

1083
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Let's try, Miss

1084
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
If we

1085
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Keep on loving this heart

1086
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Yes, our heart will be happy

1087
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Always happy

1088
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Chocolate makes you happy

1089
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Wait a minute

1090
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's smart

1091
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Miss, I don't want to

1092
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Be friends with Alva

1093
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Rio is our new leader

1094
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Because the one who is evil

1095
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Is only Rio

1096
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That's right

1097
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Where is Rio?

1098
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Alva

1099
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Where is Alva?

1100
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Classroom is not here

1101
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Where is Alva?

1102
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Alva

1103
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I better look here

1104
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Where is it?

1105
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:24,000
This is

1106
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Why is Rio's name

1107
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So similar to Professor Rangkara?

1108
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Maybe

1109
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Alva is right

1110
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
What else can Professor Rangkara and Rio do?

1111
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
In the toilet

1112
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Don't use it

1113
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Here, I want to show you

1114
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Where is the map?

1115
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I left it

1116
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I want to show you

1117
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Show me what?

1118
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Maybe

1119
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
The map you gave me

1120
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Is broken

1121
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You mean?

1122
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Because there is Professor Rangkara

1123
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And he always

1124
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Have a fight with his new kid

1125
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
His name is Rio

1126
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That means

1127
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There is Rangkara near Rio

1128
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:34,000
There

1129
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I'm going to kill you

1130
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Rio

1131
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
What are you doing?

1132
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Professor

1133
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's a disaster

1134
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Rio, why did you do that?

1135
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Show your spirit

1136
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Get ready, my friend

1137
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Run, jump,

1138
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Jump, and get the stars

1139
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Be brave

1140
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Don't give up

1141
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Chase your dreams

1142
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Go, go, go

1143
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Achieve all your dreams

1144
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Go, go, go

1145
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Never stop

1146
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Go, go, go

1147
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Fight with your heart

1148
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Go, go, go

1149
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Make yourself proud

1150
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Go, go, go

1151
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Let's dream

1152
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Go, go, go

1153
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
We will
