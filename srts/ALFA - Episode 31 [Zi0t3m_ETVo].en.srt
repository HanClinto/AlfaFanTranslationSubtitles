1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, run with courage

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Mission accomplished, sir

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Aldebaran finally believes in Leon

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I mean, your brionel, sir

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, your task is to fight that protective spirit

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
With a spell of torture

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, a spell of torture

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You beat the bad guys with a spell of torture, right?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's black magic, you know?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Vega, usually you can make a spell

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why are you a failure now?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:26,000
A battle of courage and bravery

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Test, one, two, three, sir

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Test, Roger, Roger, sir

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The result is here, sir

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How's Leon's development there?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wow, it's amazing, sir

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Leon is now the smartest kid in the school

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He even beat Vega, sir

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hahaha

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Good job, sir

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But there's only one problem, sir

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Alfa stole Leon, sir

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm worried that Alfa can disrupt our plan, sir

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alfa

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's this, sir?

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hahaha

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's my love potion, sir

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Whoever drinks this potion, he will be loyal and be with Leon

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Including Alfa

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wow, that's amazing, sir

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hahaha

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Vega

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Leon

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're still a kid and you're sending letters?

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're so stupid

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Shut up

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Learn from me, kid

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll give you a present

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not a kid anymore

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey, there's a Lion

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What's up?

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you miss us?

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, we miss you

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Can I get closer to you?

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes, you can

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We're going to have a party tonight

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you want to come?

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, we do

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, then you can tell the others

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, kid

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
One more thing

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't tell the teacher

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Just a little

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If the teacher knows, we'll be scolded

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, of course

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, just trust us

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, thank you

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hello, come here

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Come here

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, everyone

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're going to have a Valentine's Day party

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's right

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But there's one condition

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't tell the teacher

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Now, we're going to prepare

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The Valentine's Day party

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But don't tell anyone

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Just trust us

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[Valentine's Day]

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Did you buy the flowers?

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, I was given them

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Who did you give them to?

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Maria

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She said she's sorry

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Because she cheated on me

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, Maria

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's so sweet

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Maria, come to the party

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Come here

95
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Did you know?

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
She's going to have a midnight class

97
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Today?

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It must be fun

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Can we join?

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of course

101
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because she's going to invite all the students

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't tell the teacher

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
She might scold us

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
[Valentine's Day]

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you going to the midnight class?

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
With Rio?

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't feel good with her

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't like her?

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's a good girl

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Right, Rita?

114
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, she's a good girl

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's go together

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So you can get closer to her

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Good afternoon, Your Highness

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
How is it?

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Have you managed to get them?

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Of course, Your Highness

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
[The most beautiful moment]

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This is it

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is impossible

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How is it impossible?

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's possible

126
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The fabric is already touched by the queen

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No one has ever dyed my fabric with blood

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And yet

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're still cheating

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Wait

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Queen

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The queen wants us to die by dyeing this fabric?

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Of course

135
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You all deserve to die

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because you want to get the most valuable treasure in this world

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Guys, I can't wait for the midnight class

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Me too, Sis

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Shh

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't make a noise, or the teacher will laugh at us

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're my sister

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're so annoying

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now, let's divide the tasks

144
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Rita, Pega

145
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Prepare the food

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We're the sexy decoration

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Because we're sexy

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Smart, my sister

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay

151
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, you're the sexy decoration

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Ray and I will prepare the drinks

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What are we doing?

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're the satbang

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Alpah, your task is to wake up the other students

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's 11 PM

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you think?

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you sure that there will be a party at 11 PM?

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Of course, Alpah

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But Ray, our school was just attacked by the labah-labah

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Without the teacher's knowledge

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's very dangerous

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What if something happens?

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're paranoid, Alpah

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The monster is dead

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If it's still there, it's still on the beach

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If the monster is still there, it will be still there

169
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's right

170
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We're still here

171
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Hero is Rio

172
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Rio is my hero

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Rio Nelo Hero

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you doing?

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're a scum

176
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're a monster

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The two of you

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're wearing a skirt

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The respected queen

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The guardian has left

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Watch out

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The teacher is here

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You missed

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The teacher is here

185
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There's a stone in the grave

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The queen has escaped

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's go

188
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Wait

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's okay

190
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mik, the army

191
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We must hold on

192
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hang in there

193
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why is the lollipop here?

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's just there

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I forgot

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This lollipop is broken because I used a magic to open it

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I must throw it

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The lollipop fell

199
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll throw it

200
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The lollipop is holding the queen's lollipop

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Good, the lollipop is smart

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It can save itself

203
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What are they doing?

204
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I won't let you go

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let me go

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you don't let me go, I'll force you

207
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Try it if you can

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:48,000
All creatures have weak spots

209
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
They are in the neck, waist, and feet

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The queen is in the neck

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The queen is in the head

212
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What are you doing?

213
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why can't you move?

214
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm the queen's guardian

215
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, I can't move

216
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why can't the queen's guardian move?

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What are you doing here?

218
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The queen is in the neck

219
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What should we do?

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Wait

221
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Check, test 1, 2, 3

222
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Hotel?

223
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
My dear hotel

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The hotel is broken

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hotel, come here right now

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Help Nick, don't let him fall

227
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hurry, help him

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Come on, Nick

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't give up, Nick

230
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
My dear hotel

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're safe, Nick

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What's going on?

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why can't I move?

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Help

235
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Please, don't let me go

236
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If you want to give me the necklace

237
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll lock the queen again

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't want to be taught

239
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What are you doing?

240
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll lock the queen so she can't fly

241
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Then, she'll fall down

242
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And her beautiful face will be sucked by the rock

243
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you want to be ugly?

244
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, I don't want to be ugly

245
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Give me the necklace now

246
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay

247
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're so annoying

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll lock the queen

249
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Please, Nick

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't want to be taught

251
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll lock the queen

252
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't want to be taught

253
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll lock the queen

254
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't want to be taught

255
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll lock the queen

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't want to be taught

257
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll lock the queen

258
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't want to be taught

259
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll lock the queen

260
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't want to be taught

261
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's weird

262
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why is everyone suspicious of me?

263
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I thought I was the one who's suspicious

264
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I should ask Panji

265
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll be in trouble if I tell them

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I've been given a present by Panji

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Peta, yes

268
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He said it's a gift from God

269
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's go

270
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why is there a school?

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's so crowded

272
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There are so many people walking around the school

273
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm so proud

274
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm going to the hospital

275
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why is there a sign saying "Prosangkara"?

276
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Ryo is following me

277
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't know where he is

278
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Ryo is following me in the dark

279
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Where is he going?

280
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I have to go there

281
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you doing?

282
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is a gift from God

283
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ryo, I'm sorry

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What's wrong?

285
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Who were you with?

286
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was with a stranger

287
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm alone here

288
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What do you want?

289
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Nothing

290
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't need anything

291
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm going

292
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't feel good

293
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Maybe

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Professor Angkari is going to be a good person

295
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe

296
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Prosangkara is going to be Ryo

297
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't think so

298
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I have to give him the top vega and other things

299
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So, they'll be aware

300
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think Alfa is going to be suspicious

301
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Calm down, Leon

302
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He's going to be the guard of the 8th prince

303
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

304
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He's going to be the guard of the 8th prince

305
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's good

306
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm going to make a cake

307
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Our cake

308
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You can make it

309
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You can choose

310
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Why are you making a surprise?

311
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You must be waiting for someone else

312
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You want to taste our cake

313
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes

314
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I have an important news for you

315
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What news?

316
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This news

317
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The guard is coming

318
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
We can't tell anyone

319
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There will be a problem

320
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Let's hide

321
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Come here

322
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Hide me first

323
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He's running away

324
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm going to be the guard of the 8th prince

325
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's safe

326
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But I'm curious

327
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Who dares to come in here

328
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And do all of this

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Whoever it is

330
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
This person is too much

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Lack of work

332
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Annoying and useless

333
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He's here

334
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You're under arrest

335
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm not

336
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I heard that noise

337
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
From here

338
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But it's weird

339
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There's no one here

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:15,000
My food is running out

341
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's running out

342
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The 8th prince

343
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Or maybe

344
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is Angkara's doing

345
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He's doing all of this to take revenge on me

346
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm going to look for the key

347
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm going to the kitchen

348
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This way

349
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Let's go

350
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
From here to Angkara

351
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Let's go to the kitchen

352
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Let's go to Angkara

353
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's go to the kitchen

354
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There he is

355
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Weird

356
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But there's a writing in the wall

357
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But he's just acting

358
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So suspicious

359
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He's coming

360
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Wait here

361
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll go in

362
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So you can be safe

363
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
If I pass by

364
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You tell me

365
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So suspicious

366
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Why did he tell me to watch over there?

367
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What is he doing in there?

368
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Bofo

369
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What's that?

370
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's safe

371
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's time for me to wait

372
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
What are you doing in there?

373
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Why are you here?

374
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I've been following you

375
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And now I want to know

376
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What are you hiding in there?

377
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm not hiding anything

378
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't lie

379
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I saw something

380
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And you

381
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You're not hiding anything

382
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm not hiding anything

383
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And you

384
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You're hiding something

385
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What is it?

386
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Answer me

387
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't understand

388
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
What do you mean?

389
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'll check it myself

390
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Don't

391
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Why not?

392
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Because I didn't put anything in there

393
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I don't believe you

394
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll check it myself

395
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Don't

396
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What are you?

397
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What are you doing in there?

398
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Why are you stopping me?

399
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm stopping you

400
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Because I'm afraid you'll ruin this drink

401
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now you better get out

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If not, what are you going to do?

403
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What are you going to do?

404
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'll kill you

405
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Don't drink it

406
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't

407
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Rey

408
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Okay

409
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Starting tonight

410
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'll stay here

411
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I won't sleep

412
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll investigate

413
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Who is this person

414
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
If that person is you

415
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll kill him

416
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Alpha

417
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What are you doing here?

418
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Rey

419
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But Rey

420
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I just want to protect you all

421
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
He's evil

422
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He's the one who put the poison in the drink

423
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's a lie

424
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
He's lying

425
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's true

426
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm confused

427
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I just want to protect you all

428
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Because

429
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Rion put the poison in the drink

430
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's a lie

431
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's true

432
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If you want to know if it's true or a lie

433
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Try this drink

434
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No Rey

435
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's a poison

436
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You'll die

437
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Come on Rey

438
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You'll know who's right or wrong

439
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Don't Rey

440
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Don't drink it

441
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Don't Rey

442
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Rey

443
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Don't drink it

444
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Let me go

445
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What are you doing?

446
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The drink doesn't have poison

447
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm fine

448
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You're the one who's evil

449
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You've been eating this

450
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And you

451
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You hurt my friend

452
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
My best friend

453
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Rey

454
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Hi everyone

455
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry

456
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I think

457
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The party tonight was a failure

458
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Why?

459
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because

460
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The cake and the drink

461
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Are ruined

462
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Ruined

463
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The party is ruined because of Alfa

464
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
She ruined our party

465
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Who's Alfa?

466
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
She's a jerk

467
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
She'll beat up the kids

468
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Beat up the kids?

469
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Let's make a gang

470
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Rey, do you feel weird?

471
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
With Sira

472
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Why?

473
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You don't see it

474
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Usually she's not that angry

475
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
With Alfa

476
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I don't know

477
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What's wrong with her?

478
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Why is Rey like that?

479
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's weird that she's mad at me

480
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It must be because of Sirio

481
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'll show her

482
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'll reveal her secret

483
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'll show her

484
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What's wrong?

485
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Weird

486
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What's wrong?

487
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's a punishment for you Alfa

488
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Because you made a mess

489
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
What's going on?

490
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Is this a prank?

491
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We've decided

492
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
For a month

493
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We'll be your friends

494
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Why me?

495
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because you ruined our party

496
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's go

497
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Poor Alfa

498
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Actually we don't know

499
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What's wrong

500
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
With Alfa or Sirio

501
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Me too

502
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This must be Ryo's doing

503
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Ryo must be

504
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Making them to blame me

505
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Ryo is evil

506
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Evil?

507
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's hot

508
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Riding a pony and a giraffe

509
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's obvious

510
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I think

511
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
We're going to lose

512
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Don't underestimate us

513
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's obvious

514
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
We're going to lose

515
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You're the one who's been coming

516
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh my god

517
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
What should we do?

518
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It doesn't mean we're going to lose

519
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Nik

520
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What should we do?

521
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Sorry guys

522
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I failed

523
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
All the efforts we've done

524
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's a waste

525
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm sorry

526
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You're being cheated on

527
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Stay calm

528
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I lied

529
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I won

530
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Don't be so arrogant

531
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You're going to ruin the equipment

532
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Don't you believe I won?

533
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You won, Nik

534
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You got a prize

535
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You got it

536
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah

537
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Last star

538
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Alif Ba

539
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Nik, come here

540
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Let me use this

541
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Don't touch it

542
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If it falls

543
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Into the hands of evil people

544
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It can be dangerous

545
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'd better use it

546
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Sorry, soldier

547
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
With all my heart

548
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's not suitable for a soldier

549
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Right, friend?

550
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's a girl's dress

551
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But look

552
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's suitable

553
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Here

554
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'd better use it

555
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Rather than

556
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Being stolen

557
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's more dangerous

558
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Than being stolen

559
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Do you understand?

560
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We have to save this

561
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's hard to get

562
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Finally

563
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
We got the soul stone

564
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We got it

565
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You're being cheated on

566
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
A lot

567
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Kids

568
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's time to go home

569
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Okay, soldier

570
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Do you know

571
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You're all

572
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Super stupid

573
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You got

574
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
One of these

575
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's hard to ask for forgiveness

576
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They say, last star is a boy

577
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
A magic school kid

578
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Where is it?

579
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Come on

580
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Let's go home

581
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's getting late

582
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Let's go

583
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Alfa

584
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What?

585
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You want to scold me?

586
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No, we don't

587
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Whatever

588
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We're still friends

589
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But you have to believe

590
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm not wrong

591
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Do you believe me?

592
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
If you don't, it's okay

593
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Okay

594
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's okay

595
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I have proof

596
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Riaw is evil

597
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
She's in a group with Professor Angkara

598
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The school

599
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What's that?

600
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
This is the school map

601
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I gave it to Mr. Panji

602
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That time

603
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Everyone here

604
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Will see it

605
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Let's open it

606
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The map is cool

607
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Cool, right?

608
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Here

609
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'll tell you where Riaw is

610
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You'll see

611
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
She's always with Professor Angkara

612
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Where is it?

613
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Here it is

614
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Where is Professor Angkara?

615
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That's Riaw, Karen, and the others

616
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:06,000
She's always with Professor Angkara

617
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But she's not here

618
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That's weird

619
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Why is she alone?

620
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Where is Professor Angkara?

621
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Maybe she's tired

622
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
She should rest

623
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Maybe she's missing her parents

624
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's why she's in a bad mood

625
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Maybe she's tired

626
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
She should rest

627
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Maybe she's missing her parents

628
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That's why she's in a bad mood

629
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe she's tired

630
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Maybe she's missing her parents

631
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That's why she's in a bad mood

632
00:43:36,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We can do it

633
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
To the city of Malang

634
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And then to the city of Perapan

635
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Let's go home

636
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Let's go

637
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You'll get mad

638
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
One

639
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Two

640
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Three

641
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This is our last chance

642
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
We have to protect her

643
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Don't let her get hurt

644
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We hope we can get to school

645
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So she can go home safely

646
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Amen

647
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You're such a jerk

648
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Let's go home

649
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Let's go

650
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What should we do?

651
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
One, two, three, go

652
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
To the city of Perapan

653
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Alright

654
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
With this coffee

655
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'll be safe

656
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Until the next three days

657
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So I won't be in Malang

658
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There's no one here

659
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This must be the same person

660
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This is the same person

661
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
He's playing with me

662
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Continue drinking your coffee

663
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's so enjoyable at night

664
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So enjoyable

665
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
(Sleeping)

666
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm sleepy

667
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Are you sleepy?

668
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No, I'm not

669
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You can't be sleepy

670
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Open your eyes

671
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You can't sleep

672
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Can't sleep

673
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
(The next day)

674
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Come on, kids

675
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Let's make the school beautiful

676
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Put the flowers there

677
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
How beautiful it is

678
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
When the world is full of love

679
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Wow

680
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000

682
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Who likes brown?

683
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yes

684
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Come on, come here

685
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
This is the brown

686
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
We'll divide it one by one

687
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
The contents

688
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
We won't divide it, we'll open it

689
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But we'll give it to the friends

690
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Happy Valentine's Day

691
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I hope our day is filled with love

692
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Open it

693
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Thank you, professor

694
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The brown

695
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Makes us love each other more

696

Thank you, kids

Thank you, professor

Happy Valentine's Day

701
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Sorry

702
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't celebrate Valentine's Day

703
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So you just keep your advice

704
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because it won't be useful for me

705
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Do you understand?

706
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Why don't you celebrate it?

707
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Because professor Purwa is single

708
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Shut up

709
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Where's Alfa?

710
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't know, professor

711
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't know where Alfa is

712
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Maybe Alfa is single

713
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Because he lost to Ria

714
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yes, professor

715
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Alfa is just a story

716
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
He likes to be single

717
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And he's single

718
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
He's single

719
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Is that true?

720
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yes, it's true

721
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I must have lost to them

722
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That's why I like to think weird

723
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
If I meet them

724
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'll be happy

725
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I need to think about Ria

726
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And my parents

727
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Alright

728
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Now we'll learn Mantra

Mantra

730
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I'll introduce

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Who can answer?

733
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
What's the Mantra?

734
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Rio

735
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If you use this Mantra

736
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
An enemy will appear

737
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And the enemy will fall

738
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
If you don't understand the Mantra

739
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But the answer is easy

740
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Good

741
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Now

742
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
We'll try this Mantra together

743
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I must fail to other students

744
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
So that Rio will be number one

I can!

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
The Mantra is Sevenka

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Hit their tanks

779
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Come on, hit them

780
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Don't, soldier

781
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The car can be damaged, soldier

782
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Don't, soldier, we'll fall

783
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Hit them harder

784
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Don't, soldier

785
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Run

786
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Professor Aldebaran

787
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I have something to tell you

788
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
What is it, Professor?

789
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Alpha has dared to ask me

790
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
He's starting to rebel

791
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
How?

792
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Today, he's going to take my class

793
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Please

794
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Professor Aldebaran, give him a lesson

795
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I'm not a coward

796
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's not like usual

797
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Alpha makes a mistake

798
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Unless there's a clear reason

799
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes

800
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You should not defend him

801
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Keep your head down

802
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
He might grow up

803
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Like Gamma

804
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Professor Purwa, please

805
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
When you see Alpha

806
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Don't imagine Gamma

807
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But remember Akilah

808
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Akilah

809
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
If you're not married to Gamma

810
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You'll be there

811
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm going

812
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Oh my God

813
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
The painting is here

814
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Where?

815
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Whose voice is that?

816
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:56,000
The door is locked

817
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Maybe

818
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
This is our parents' voice

819
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Come here

820
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:30,000
What is he doing?

821
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
He usually does this

822
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Why is he doing this now?

823
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I can't see anything

824
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I'm sorry

825
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Because the party

826
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Failed today

827
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It's okay

828
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
As a request

829
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm sorry

830
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'll give you a present

831
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
[Applause]

832
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Seriously?

833
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes

834
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
By the way, this is a special gift

835
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
A black suit

836
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
[Laughter]

837
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Really?

838
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Okay, let's go

839
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I want to ask

840
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Where is Alpha?

841
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Alpha?

842
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
How do I know?

843
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I'm not in the wrong

844
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Why?

845
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's just like that

846
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It's so funny

847
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I know

848
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm like that

849
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Confused

850
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I'm dizzy

851
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Where are you going?

852
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You are the descendants of the dead

853
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Let's hurry

854
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Feel this

855
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We play cowboy

856
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
[Laughter]

857
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Cowboy dance

858
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
[Laughter]

859
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Cowboy dance

860
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
[Laughter]

861
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
One more time

862
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Cowboy dance

863
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
We're going to the airport

864
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Ouch

865
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Why did you get a bird?

866
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's really annoying

867
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Why flying?

868
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Why are there so many birds?

869
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What should we do?

870
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
How do we keep the soldiers from attacking us?

871
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I have an idea

872
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
What if we cut the rest?

873
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Agree?

874
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Agree

875
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Bastard

876
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Damn bird

877
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Just destroy it

878
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Make a mess

879
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
One two three

880
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
What are you doing?

881
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You guys are not teaching

882
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
What are you guys?

883
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
How dare you touch me?

884
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Hurry up

885
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And you guys

886
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I'll make you fall back

887
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Fall to the sea

888
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Feel this

889
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Torvanado

890
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Where's my Tongsis?

891
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
How dare you take my Tongsis?

892
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You guys are not teaching

893
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
They are not polite

894
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
They are too brave to the soldiers

895
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Watch out

896
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Sorry soldiers

897
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I can't give Tongsis here to the soldiers

898
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
The soldiers won't be able to hurt us again

899
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
[Laughs]

900
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
But he can still be angry

901
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
If he's just angry at your mouth

902
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
We can still chew it

903
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Slow down

904
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Why is he so like that?

905
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
With Alfa

906
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yes, are you still angry?

907
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
With Alfa because of the order

908
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Failed

909
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Why is it just like that?

910
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It's too much

911
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I'm suspicious of him

912
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
He's always with Ray

913
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Ray, where are you going?

914
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Ray

915
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Cover me

916
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I'm looking for

917
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Padang rice

918
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Who's that for?

919
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That's Rio's cousin

920
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Poor thing, she's hungry

921
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I'll go first

922
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Ray

923
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Wait

924
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's dangerous, you know

925
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
[Groans]

926
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Got it, Padang rice

927
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Nice, Padang rice

928
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Why is he so angry?

929
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't know

930
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Listen

931
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I'll answer your question

932
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
What's wrong with you and Alfa?

933
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
What do you mean?

934
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You're always angry

935
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Because of the order

936
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
You know

937
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'll go first

938
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Ray, why is he so like that?

939
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
What's wrong with him?

940
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
He's always angry

941
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yes, he's not a bad person

942
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
But he did it on purpose

943
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
To make us look bad

944
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
He's been friends with Alfa for a long time

945
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Why is he so like that?

946
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
He must be a bad person

947
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I'm confused

948
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Alfa is a good person

949
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
As long as you know

950
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Alfa is a good person

951
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Not like Rio

952
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Why is he so like that?

953
01:01:48,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Ray, what's wrong with him?

954
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
He's so bad

955
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Alfa is a bad person

956
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
But you're right

957
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Alfa is a bad person

958
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He's always suspicious of Rio

959
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Even though Rio is a good person

960
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And handsome

961
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Why are you talking like that?

962
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Why?

963
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's not wrong to talk like that

964
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You're just following him

965
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You said Alfa is a good person

966
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
But now you're changing

967
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Rio is a good person

968
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Not like Alfa

969
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You're right

970
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That chocolate

971
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
There must be something

972
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
In that chocolate

973
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
That makes Prika change her mind

974
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Here's your chocolate

975
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Here

976
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
What are you doing?

977
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
That's my chocolate

978
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I just want to see it

979
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You can't

980
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That's my chocolate

981
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I don't want it

982
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Let me see

983
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Ouch

984
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Let's go

985
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Wait

986
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Why is he like that?

987
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
He's so suspicious

988
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Of them

989
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Thank you

990
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You're the one who saved me

991
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Where are you?

992
01:03:42,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm suspicious

993
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
If all of this is a fabrication

994
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Who did this?

995
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Alfa

996
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I did it

997
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's okay

998
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm sorry

999
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I attacked you

1000
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Why did you attack me?

1001
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Because I thought you're a spy

1002
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
A spy?

1003
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yes

1004
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
For the past few days

1005
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
There's been

1006
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
What is this?

1007
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
There's blood

1008
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Flowers

1009
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Everywhere

1010
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
It's too much

1011
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Too much

1012
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It turns out that person

1013
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Still dare to come here

1014
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Mr. Paji, actually

1015
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Who did this?

1016
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I don't know

1017
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Before

1018
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I already

1019
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Wanted to stay here

1020
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But I don't know

1021
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Why I suddenly fainted

1022
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And I fell asleep in the room

1023
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm surprised

1024
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Before

1025
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I drank coffee

1026
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
My favorite coffee, Alfa

1027
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
But why

1028
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I can fall asleep

1029
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Alfa, this is a child

1030
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
A child?

1031
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yes, a child

1032
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Impossible

1033
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Alfa, because he has

1034
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Very high knowledge

1035
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Before

1036
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
He also succeeded in picking up

1037
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
The password I made to protect this tomb

1038
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Alfa, so it's impossible

1039
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
He did it, or the child did it

1040
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm suspicious

1041
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
If all of this

1042
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Is a child's doing

1043
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Yes, sir

1044
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
This is also my purpose to come here

1045
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Besides I miss

1046
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
My parents

1047
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I want to talk about the prosperity of Angkara

1048
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
What is it, Alfa?

1049
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Did Angkara make a child again from school?

1050
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The child is a child

1051
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Rio is so cool, she gave us chocolate

1052
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's delicious

1053
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Rio is our true leader

1054
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Yes, I will follow her forever

1055
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Live, Rio

1056
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Let's try, Miss

1057
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
If we

1058
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Keep on loving this heart

1059
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Yes, our heart will be happy

1060
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Always happy

1061
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Chocolate makes you happy

1062
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Wait a minute

1063
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's smart

1064
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Miss, I don't want to

1065
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Be friends with Alfa

1066
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Rio is our new leader

1067
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Because the one who is evil

1068
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Is only Rio

1069
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That's right

1070
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Where is Rio?

1071
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Alfa

1072
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Where is Alfa?

1073
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Classroom is not here

1074
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Where is Alfa?

1075
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Alfa

1076
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I better look here

1077
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Where is it?

1078
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:24,000
This is

1079
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Why is Rio's name

1080
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So similar to Professor Rangkara?

1081
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Maybe

1082
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Alfa is right

1083
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
What else can Professor Rangkara and Rio do?

1084
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
In the toilet

1085
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Don't use it

1086
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Here, I want to show you

1087
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Where is the map?

1088
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I left it

1089
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I want to show you

1090
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Show me what?

1091
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Maybe

1092
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
The map you gave me

1093
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Is broken

1094
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You mean?

1095
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Because there is Professor Rangkara

1096
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And he always

1097
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Have a fight with his new kid

1098
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
His name is Rio

1099
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That means

1100
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There is Rangkara near Rio

1101
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:34,000
There

1102
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I'm going to kill you

1103
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Rio

1104
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
What are you doing?

1105
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Professor

1106
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's a disaster

1107
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Rio, why did you do that?

1108
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Show your spirit

1109
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Get ready, my friend

1110
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Run, jump,

1111
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Jump, and get the stars

1112
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Be brave

1113
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Don't give up

1114
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Chase your dreams

1115
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Go, go, go

1116
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Achieve all your dreams

1117
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Go, go, go

1118
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Never stop

1119
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Go, go, go

1120
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Fight with your heart

1121
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Go, go, go

1122
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Make yourself proud

1123
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Go, go, go

1124
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Let's dream

1125
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Go, go, go

1126
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
We will
