 Show your spirit, get ready to steal your friends

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stars

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Be brave, don't give up

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Chase your passion and dreams

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Alva, why did you take that stone?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Professor Agni asked me to

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Because this school is in danger

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Only that stone can save this school

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 In three days, he will gain unlimited power

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And will destroy this world

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 You are expelled from school

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 What's wrong?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 [music]

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 What's wrong with you?

 [music]

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Maybe they want me to follow them

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I'm running away

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Why are you here?

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Come on, hurry up

 [music]

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I'm sorry, Alva

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I don't trust you anymore

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 [music]

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Okay, if you're still angry

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It's fate

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Because I was wrong

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 [music]

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 No, I'm not angry

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Are you serious?

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Yes

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 [music]

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 You're my friend, Ray

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 [music]

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Alva

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Alva

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 We believe you're not wrong

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 We prevent you from leaving

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 If so

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I want to be expelled

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So I can go to school, right?

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Yeah

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Yeah

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Unfortunately, only the three of us

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Who believe in you

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 You're still expelled from school

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 [music]

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So we have to do this

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 We have to clean your name

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 So you can go to school again

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 But how?

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 The way

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 We have to catch the person who took the stone

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 That's right

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Yes, that's right

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 The person who slandered you

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 The Dark Lord, right?

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Not the Dark Lord

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 But the person ordered by the Dark Lord

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 [music]

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 This person's magic is very great, Alva

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Therefore

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I will train the three of you

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So you can fight him

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Especially

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 You, Alva

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:15,000

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000

 Wow, that's so cool

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So cool

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Vega

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Take the stone

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And throw it to me

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 But

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Hurry up

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 [music]

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Throw it as hard as you can

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So strong

 [music]

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Now you try the magic

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Okay, Dark Lord

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Ray

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 You throw Alva with the stone

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 [music]

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Is that right, Dark Lord?

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Let's go, Ray

120
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 We test the ability of Alva's spell

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 [music]

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Alva

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 The spell you made is still too thin

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Not thick enough

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 You have to concentrate more

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 In reading this spell

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Come on

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Try again

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 [music]

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Okay

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Throw it as hard as you can

 [music]

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Sorry, bro

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 [music]

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I think

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 The training is enough here

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We will continue later

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 No, no, no, Dark Lord

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I still want to try again

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 I have to keep practicing until I can

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Don't, Alva

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 You are too tired

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 If you are forced

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 It can be dangerous for you

148

 [music]

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Come on, Ray

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Come on

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Where are you going?

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Alva

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 You have to stay here

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We have to leave here

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Because we will be searched

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Okay?

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Alva

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 If there's anything

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Just say my name three times

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But if it doesn't show up

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Just run away

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 At least

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 There's still someone who believes in me

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Um

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 So, Dark Lord

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Thank you

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You have helped me

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 We are also happy to help you

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Right, girls?

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Yippie, yippie, yay

 Celestial fruit

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 I also want to say

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Thank you

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 There's another one

 It's so quiet

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Without Vega and Ray

 [music]

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I have to practice

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So I can be like them

 It hurts

 I can't give up

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Don't let the magic stone fall into the dark palace

215
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Yes

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I want to find that person

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Remember

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Don't look for someone who is not in the dark palace

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Maybe you can find him in the sea

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But in the dark palace

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 There's no ring

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 You have to keep an eye on him

 I have to prevent the dark palace from getting that stone

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I did it

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 You're great, Alpha

243
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Perfect

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 That means

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Now

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 You can do your research

247
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Yes

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Now we have to give it to Niel

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I agree

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 We don't have to find him

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 You do it, Alpha

252
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Huh?

253
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 You will interrogate Professor Agni

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000

 Are you sure, Vega?

260
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 I'm sure

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I've followed everything in the book

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Prove it

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I want to see the result

264
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Okay, I'll prove it

 There's only one way

 You can't get wet

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 If you get wet, you'll be the first one

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Right, Nendara?

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Yes, right

 Professor Aldebaran

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Good afternoon, ma'am

285
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I mean, professor

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 What's the matter, professor?

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 What's the matter that makes you come to my office?

288
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I'm now studying the art of defense

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Can you help me attack?

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Attack you?

291
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Yes

292
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 You can try to attack me with a strong mantra

293
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Until I faint

294
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 The mantra is called

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 The Mantra of Meriamfang

296
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And it's a black magic

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I've never learned that magic

298
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And I can't do it

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Ouch

300
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 My hand suddenly hurts, professor

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Try this, professor

302
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Check it

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Ouch, it hurts, professor

304
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Try this

305
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 There's no ring

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Where's the ring, professor?

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 You don't wear a ring?

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I said, I don't wear a ring

309
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I'm sorry, professor

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Let me help you

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Oh my god

312
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I'm sorry

313
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 I can't get wet

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I have to get out of here

315
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Professor

316
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I'm sorry

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Excuse me

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 I'm a bit tired

319
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 You said you need my help, professor

320
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It's okay

321
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Professor

322
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 The Mantra of Meriamfang

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000

 Wafa

329
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 You've been expelled from this school

 Why are you still here?

 The Moon Ring

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 So, what did Professor Purwok do?

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 He's the one who took the ring

334
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 How dare you to kill me like that?

335
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Now, you're going to join me

336
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 We're going to face Professor Aldebaran

337
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 You have to leave this school

338
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Let's go

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 How dare you to fight me?

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Where are you going?

355
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Get out!

356
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Wafa

357
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Wafa

358
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You can't run away, Wafa

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Stay there!

361
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 What's that?

362
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 The Mantra of Meriamfang

363
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Where is he?

364
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 He was here just now

365
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 I think Professor Purwok can't see me

366
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Is it because of this test?

367
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Wafa

368
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 It's true, he can't see me

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Where have you been?

372
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 It's been a long time

373
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I want to sleep

374
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 You're so annoying

375
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 It hurts

376
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 What's wrong, Rey?

377
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You're the one who's annoying

378
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 What did I do to you?

379
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Don't play with me

380
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Who's playing with you?

381
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Stop it

382
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 You've been fighting and making noise

383
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 You should be calm

384
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 It's more comfortable and safer

385
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 It's more secure

387
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Oh no

388
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 You two are so annoying

389
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 How dare you to make noise

390
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 This is the soldier

391
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Just move

392
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 No, not the soldier

393
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Hey

394
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Stop fighting

395
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Wafa

396
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 When did you come?

397
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Because I'm wearing this

 This is the Mantra of Meriamfang

401
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Where did you get this?

402
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I got it from the sky

403
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 When I was chased by Professor Purwa in the cave

404
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Thanks to this, I'm safe

405
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I know who stole the stone

406
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Who?

407
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Professor Purwa

408
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 He's a man wearing a moon ring

409
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 He's the one who made me faint

410
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And he took the stone

411
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Are you sure?

412
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Yes

413
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 I saw him wearing the ring

414
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I'm sure

415
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 He's the one

416
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Don't be so sure

417
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 If you don't have any evidence

418
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 That's why we have to look for Professor Purwa's office

419
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Thank you for saving us

466
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Kids, now everything is in my room

467
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Is there anything I can talk about?

468
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Yes

469
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 From there I already know that Professor Purwa is the perpetrator

470
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 He took the medicine

471
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 That's why we have to look around the room

472
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Because when the news came out, there was still a room

473
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It was still empty

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000

 We have to be very careful with Professor Purwa

 Without making anyone suspicious

515
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 No, because everyone knows

 Don't push Alva

 She's dangerous

597
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 What are you talking about, Purwa?

598
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 You're the bad guy

599
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 I came here to pray for Alva

 Alva

 Who do you trust the most?

603
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 I give you three minutes

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 To clean the page

605
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 I work with the Ankara process

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Good, Alva

607
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 Now you help me attack him

 You shouldn't be in this school

 Alva, help me

615
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000

 But I won't let anyone

624
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 To disturb my important mission

625
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 To take the stone of eternity

626
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 Why are you surprised like that, Alva?

627
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Yes

628
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 I'm the culprit

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:56,000

635
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 I took the stone of eternity

 To give it to the 8th prince

637
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 So

638
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 I hypnotized Professor Agni

639
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 By using the body of Professor Purwa

640
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 So I can make Alva

641
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Take the stone of eternity

642
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Alva

643
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 I protect you

00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 With your friends

645
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 So you can trust me

646
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 And you can suspect Professor Purwa

647
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 I have disguised myself as Professor Agni

648
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 To take the stone of eternity easily

649
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And lastly

650
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 I used your life again, Purwa

651
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000

 The 8th prince will rise again

655
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 His power will recover

656
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000

 Are you sure you want to fight me?

 The power you have

670
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Is nothing compared to the power I have

671
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 I'm a bad person

672
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000

 Your actions are very reckless, Alva
