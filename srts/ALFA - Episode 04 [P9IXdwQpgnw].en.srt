Show your spirit, get ready to steal your friends

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stars

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Be brave, don't give up

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Chase your passion and dreams

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Go, go, go, never stop

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go, go, go, fight with all your heart

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Alva, why did you take that stone?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Professor Agni asked me to

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because this school is in danger

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Only that stone can save this school

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In three days, he will gain unlimited power

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And will destroy this world

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are expelled from school

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's wrong?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:06,000
[music]

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000

[music]

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why are you here?

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Come on, hurry up

[music]

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry, Alva

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't trust you anymore

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,000
[music]

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, if you're still angry

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's fate

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because I was wrong

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
[music]

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I'm not angry

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you serious?

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
[music]

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're my friend, Ray

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
[music]

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Alva

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We believe you're not wrong

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We prevent you from leaving

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If so

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want to be expelled

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So I can go to school, right?

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Unfortunately, only the three of us

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Who believe in you

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're still expelled from school

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
[music]

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So we have to do this

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We have to clean your name

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So you can go to school again

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But how?

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The way

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We have to catch the person who took the stone

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's right

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, that's right

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The person who slandered you

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The Dark Lord, right?

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Not the Dark Lord

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But the person ordered by the Dark Lord

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
[music]

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This person's magic is very great, Alva

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Therefore

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I will train the three of you

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you can fight him

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Especially

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You, Alva

93

Wow, that's so cool

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So cool

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Vega

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Take the stone

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And throw it to me

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurry up

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000

[music]

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now you try the magic

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, Dark Lord

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000

Ray

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You throw Alva with the stone

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
[music]

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is that right, Dark Lord?

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's go, Ray

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We test the ability of Alva's spell

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:50,000
[music]

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Alva

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The spell you made is still too thin

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Not thick enough

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You have to concentrate more

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In reading this spell

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Try again

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
[music]

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay

[music]

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sorry, bro

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
[music]

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The training is enough here

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We will continue later

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, no, no, Dark Lord

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I still want to try again

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I have to keep practicing until I can

142
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't, Alva

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You are too tired

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you are forced

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It can be dangerous for you

146

[music]

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come on, Ray

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where are you going?

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Alva

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You have to stay here

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We have to leave here

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because we will be searched

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay?

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000

If there's anything

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Just say my name three times

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But if it doesn't show up

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Just run away

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
At least

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
There's still someone who believes in me

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Um

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So, Dark Lord

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You have helped me

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We are also happy to help you

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Right, girls?

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I also want to say

Thank you

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There's another one

It's so quiet

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Without Vega and Ray

[music]

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have to practice

You have to act faster

Before the moon is full

209
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't let the magic stone fall into the dark palace

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I want to find that person

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Remember

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't look for someone who is not in the dark palace

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe you can find him in the sea

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But in the dark palace

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There's no ring

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have to keep an eye on him

I have to prevent the dark palace from getting that stone

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have to practice

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I did it

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're great, Alpha

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Perfect

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That means

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You can do your research

242
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Now we have to give it to Niel

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I agree

245
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We don't have to find him

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You do it, Alpha

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Huh?

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You will interrogate Professor Agni

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
By pretending to be Professor Aldebaran

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000

With this report, you can be Professor Aldebaran

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Are you sure, Vega?

255
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sure

256
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I've followed everything in the book

257
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Prove it

258
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I want to see the result

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, I'll prove it

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There's only one way

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can't get wet

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you get wet, you'll be the first one

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Right, Nendara?

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes, right

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000

Professor Aldebaran

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Good afternoon, ma'am

280
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean, professor

281
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What's the matter, professor?

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What's the matter that makes you come to my office?

283
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm now studying the art of defense

284
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Can you help me attack?

285
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Attack you?

286
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can try to attack me with a strong mantra

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Until I faint

289
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The mantra is called

290
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

291
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's a black magic

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I've never learned that magic

293
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I can't do it

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Ouch

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
My hand suddenly hurts, professor

296
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Try this, professor

297
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Check it

298
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ouch, it hurts, professor

299
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Try this

300
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's no ring

301
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where's the ring, professor?

302
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You don't wear a ring?

303
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I said, I don't wear a ring

304
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry, professor

305
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Let me help you

306
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh my god

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm sorry

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't get wet

309
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have to get out of here

310
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Professor

311
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry

312
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Excuse me

313
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm a bit tired

314
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You said you need my help, professor

315
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's okay

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Professor

00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

318
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Professor Purwok

Wafa

320
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You've been expelled from this school

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why are you still here?

322
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The Moon Ring

323
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So, what did Professor Purwok do?

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He's the one who took the ring

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How dare you to kill me like that?

326
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Now, you're going to join me

327
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We're going to face Professor Aldebaran

328
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You have to leave this school

329
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's go

330
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How dare you to fight me?

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Wafa

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000

Wafa

334
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Where are you going?

335
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Get out!

336
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Wafa

337
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can't run away, Wafa

338
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Stay there!

339
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

340
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What's that?

341
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Where is he?

343
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He was here just now

344
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I think Professor Purwok can't see me

345
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is it because of this test?

346
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Wafa

347
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's true, he can't see me

348
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

349
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Where have you been?

350
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's been a long time

351
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I want to sleep

352
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're so annoying

353
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It hurts

354
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What's wrong, Rey?

355
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You're the one who's annoying

356
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What did I do to you?

357
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Don't play with me

358
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Who's playing with you?

359
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Stop it

360
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You've been fighting and making noise

361
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You should be calm

362
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's more comfortable and safer

363
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's more secure

364
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

365
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh no

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You two are so annoying

367
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How dare you to make noise

368
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This is the soldier

369
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Just move

370
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No, not the soldier

371
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Hey

372
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Stop fighting

373
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Wafa

374
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
When did you come?

375
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because I'm wearing this

376
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

377
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
If we wear it, we can't see

378
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is the Mantra of Meriamfang

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Where did you get this?

380
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I got it from the sky

381
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
When I was chased by Professor Purwa in the cave

382
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Thanks to this, I'm safe

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I know who stole the stone

384
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Who?

385
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Professor Purwa

386
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He's a man wearing a moon ring

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
He's the one who made me faint

388
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And he took the stone

389
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are you sure?

390
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I saw him wearing the ring

392
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sure

393
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He's the one

394
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000

That's why we have to look for Professor Purwa's office

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We walk slowly to the door

And then we run away

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Thank you for saving us

421
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Kids, now everything is in my room

422
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Is there anything I can talk about?

423
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes

424
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
From there I already know that Professor Purwa is the perpetrator

425
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
He took the medicine

426
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's why we have to look around the room

427
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Because when the news came out, there was still a room

428
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It was still empty

429
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Kids, what you did was very dangerous

430
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000

What do you mean, Purwa?

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Fine

It's nothing, Professor

I just want to make sure that Professor Langkara

449

The enemy is right in front of us

Tomorrow is the first day of the month

And we haven't played the game of "Tuka Badian" yet

We have to be very careful with Professor Purwa

Tomorrow, he will go to school

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Forgive me, Professor Purwa

589
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Because I accused you wrongly

590
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Your actions are very reckless, Alva

591
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You could have been killed

592
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
[Music]

593
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Attention, everyone

594
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Please listen to this important news

595
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
As you know

596
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The Stone of Eternity has been stolen

597
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But now

598
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
With a happy heart I inform you that

599
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The thief has been caught

600
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Now

601
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I will call a child

602
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Who has helped us find the thief

603
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Alva

604
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:17,000

605
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,000
[Applause]

606
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And from now on

607
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The school has decided

608
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
If Alva

609
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Will not be expelled from the school

610
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And even

611
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
The school will give

612
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Alva a medal

613
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
For all her services

614
00:50:45,000 --> 00:51:18,000

615
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Congratulations

616
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Thank you, Professor

617
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Alva

618
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,120
Bouncing in the dark dreams

619
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:42,780
Be brave, don't give up

620
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:49,900
Chase your hope and dream

621
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,360
Go, go, go!

Go, go, go!

624
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,080
Never ever stop

625
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,140
Go, go, go!

626
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,000
Fight with all your heart

627
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Go, go, go!

628
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,500
Make yourself proud

629
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
Go, go, go!

630
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,800
Let's dream

631
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,060
Go, go, go!

632
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:20,880
We can do it

633
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:36,820
Go, go, go!

634
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,300
Achieve all your dreams

635
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,300
Go, go, go!

636
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,760
