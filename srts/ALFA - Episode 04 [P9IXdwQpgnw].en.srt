Alfa, why did you take that stone?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Professor Agni asked me to

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because this school is in danger

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Only that stone can save this school

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In three days, he will gain unlimited power

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And will destroy this world

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are expelled from school

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000

I don't trust you anymore

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, if you're still angry

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's fate

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because I was wrong

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I'm not angry

Are you serious?

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes

Alfa

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We believe you're not wrong

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We prevent you from leaving

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If so

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want to be expelled

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So I can go to school, right?

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Unfortunately, only the three of us

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Who believe in you

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're still expelled from school

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
[music]

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So we have to do this

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We have to clean your name

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So you can go to school again

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But how?

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The way

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We have to catch the person who took the stone

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's right

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, that's right

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The person who slandered you

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The Dark Lord, right?

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Not the Dark Lord

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But the person ordered by the Dark Lord

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
[music]

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This person's magic is very great, Alfa

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Therefore

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I will train the three of you

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you can fight him

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Especially

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You, Alfa

Wow, that's so cool

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So cool

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Vega

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Take the stone

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And throw it to me

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurry up

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now you try the magic

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, Dark Lord

Ray

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You throw Alfa with the stone

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
[music]

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is that right, Dark Lord?

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's go, Ray

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We test the ability of Alfa's spell

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:50,000
[music]

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Alfa

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The spell you made is still too thin

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Not thick enough

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You have to concentrate more

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In reading this spell

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Try again

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sorry, bro

[music]

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The training is enough here

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We will continue later

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, no, no, Dark Lord

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I still want to try again

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I have to keep practicing until I can

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't, Alfa

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You are too tired

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you are forced

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It can be dangerous for you

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come on, Ray

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where are you going?

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Alfa

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You have to stay here

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We have to leave here

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because we will be searched

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay?

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000

If there's anything

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Just say my name three times

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But if it doesn't show up

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Just run away

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
At least

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
There's still someone who believes in me

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000

So, Dark Lord

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You have helped me

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We are also happy to help you

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Right, girls?

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000

I also want to say

Thank you

It's so quiet

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Without Vega and Ray

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have to practice

Alpha

You have to act faster

Before the moon is full

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't let the magic stone fall into the dark palace

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I want to find that person

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Remember

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't look for someone who is not in the dark palace

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe you can find him in the sea

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But in the dark palace

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There's no ring

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have to keep an eye on him

I have to prevent the dark palace from getting that stone

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I did it

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're great, Alpha

237
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Perfect

238
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That means

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You can do your research

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Now we have to give it to Niel

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I agree

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We don't have to find him

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You do it, Alpha

246
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Huh?

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You will interrogate Professor Agni

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
By pretending to be Professor Aldebaran

249
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000

With this report, you can be Professor Aldebaran

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Are you sure, Vega?

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sure

255
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I've followed everything in the book

256
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Prove it

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I want to see the result

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, I'll prove it

There's only one way

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can't get wet

271
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you get wet, you'll be the first one

272
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Right, Nendara?

273
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes, right

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000

Professor Aldebaran

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Good afternoon, ma'am

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean, professor

280
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What's the matter, professor?

281
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What's the matter that makes you come to my office?

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm now studying the art of defense

283
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Can you help me attack?

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Attack you?

285
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes

286
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can try to attack me with a strong mantra

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Until I faint

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The mantra is called

289
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

290
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's a black magic

291
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I've never learned that magic

292
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I can't do it

293
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Ouch

294
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
My hand suddenly hurts, professor

295
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Try this, professor

296
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Check it

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ouch, it hurts, professor

298
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Try this

299
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's no ring

300
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where's the ring, professor?

301
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You don't wear a ring?

302
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I said, I don't wear a ring

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry, professor

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Let me help you

305
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh my god

306
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm sorry

307
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't get wet

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have to get out of here

309
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Professor

310
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry

311
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Excuse me

312
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm a bit tired

313
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You said you need my help, professor

314
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's okay

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Professor

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

317
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Professor Purwok

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Wafa

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You've been expelled from this school

320
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why are you still here?

321
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The Moon Ring

322
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So, what did Professor Purwok do?

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He's the one who took the ring

324
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How dare you to kill me like that?

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Now, you're going to join me

326
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We're going to face Professor Aldebaran

327
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You have to leave this school

328
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's go

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How dare you to fight me?

330
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Wafa

331
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000

Wafa

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Where are you going?

334
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Get out!

335
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Wafa

336
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can't run away, Wafa

337
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Stay there!

338
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

339
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What's that?

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

341
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Where is he?

342
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He was here just now

343
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I think Professor Purwok can't see me

344
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is it because of this test?

345
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Wafa

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's true, he can't see me

347
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

348
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Where have you been?

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's been a long time

350
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I want to sleep

351
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're so annoying

352
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It hurts

353
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What's wrong, Rey?

354
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You're the one who's annoying

355
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What did I do to you?

356
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Don't play with me

357
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Who's playing with you?

358
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Stop it

359
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You've been fighting and making noise

360
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You should be calm

361
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's more comfortable and safer

362
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's more secure

363
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

364
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh no

365
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You two are so annoying

366
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How dare you to make noise

367
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This is the soldier

368
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Just move

369
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No, not the soldier

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Hey

371
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Stop fighting

372
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Wafa

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
When did you come?

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because I'm wearing this

375
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The Mantra of Meriamfang

376
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
If we wear it, we can't see

377
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is the Mantra of Meriamfang

378
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Where did you get this?

379
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I got it from the sky

380
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
When I was chased by Professor Purwa in the cave

381
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Thanks to this, I'm safe

382
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I know who stole the stone

383
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Who?

384
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Professor Purwa

385
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He's a man wearing a moon ring

386
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
He's the one who made me faint

387
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And he took the stone

388
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are you sure?

389
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes

390
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I saw him wearing the ring

391
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sure

392
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He's the one

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Don't be so sure

394
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
If you don't have any evidence

395
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That's why we have to look for Professor Purwa's office

396
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Who knows the stone is hidden there

397
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
[The Mantra of Meriamfang]

398
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We have to hurry

399
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
[The Mantra of Meriamfang]

400
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't make noise

401
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We can't be caught

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
[The Mantra of Meriamfang]

403
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Don't make noise

404
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Can we go in?

405
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yes

406
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Don't make noise

407
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let's look for it

408
00:27:43,000 --> 00:28:32,000
[The Mantra of Meriamfang]

409
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We walk slowly to the door

410
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And then we run away

411
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Let's go

412
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Run away

413
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Stop

414
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You want to run away?

415
00:29:17,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Stop

416
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
[The Mantra of Meriamfang]

417
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Where did they go?

418
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Professor Langkara

419
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Thank you for saving us

420
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Kids, now everything is in my room

421
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Is there anything I can talk about?

422
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes

423
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
From there I already know that Professor Purwa is the perpetrator

424
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
He took the medicine

425
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's why we have to look around the room

426
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Because when the news came out, there was still a room

427
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It was still empty

428
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Kids, what you did was very dangerous

429
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I will try to reverse this

430
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Remember

431
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Next time, you have to be careful

432
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If you want to do research, you have to be prepared

433
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And don't be reckless

434
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yes, Professor

435
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You can go now

436
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Let's go

437
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
[The Mantra of Meriamfang]

438
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:42,000
What's going on?

439
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Don't pretend

440
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You did it, didn't you?

441
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Answer me

442
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What do you mean, Purwa?

443
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Fine

444
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I will make you understand what I mean

445
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
What's this?

446
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's nothing, Professor

447
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I just want to make sure that Professor Langkara

448
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The enemy is right in front of us

449
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We should be united

450
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Not divided into factions

451
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You're right, Professor

452
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I will prove that I'm right

453
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Just wait and see

454
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Tomorrow is the first day of the month

455
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And we haven't played the game of "Tuka Badian" yet

456
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We have to be very careful with Professor Purwa

457
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Tomorrow, he will go to school

458
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
To give the stone to the Dark Lord

459
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So, we have to follow him

460
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Not us, but me

461
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But, it's impossible, Alfa

462
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You can't do it alone

463
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because it's dangerous

464
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Hold on

465
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
If you and Rey go with me

466
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The teachers will be suspicious

467
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Only I can escape

468
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Without making anyone suspicious

469
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
No, because everyone knows

470
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That I was expelled from school

471
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Alfa, wait

472
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
We are friends

473
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Whatever happens, we have to be together

474
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Hold on, Rey

475
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I beg you

476
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Please listen to me

477
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You have helped me a lot

478
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And now, I have to solve it myself

479
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This is all my fault

480
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I took the stone

481
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And now, I have to break it again

482
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Alfa, stop it

483
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Okay, Rey

484
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Professor Agni

485
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Lead all the children to gather at the playground

486
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Tonight, we have to pray for the safety of the school

487
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Hurry up, children

488
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Don't let the stone to the Dark Lord

489
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm scared

490
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm already wet

491
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
There's no use hiding anymore

492
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Professor Rizal

493
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Why are there two teachers?

494
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:28,000
One of them must be using a magic to change the universe

495
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You can't reach the water

496
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
If you don't run away from the water

497
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You will become the universe

498
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Water

499
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I have to find water

500
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Find water

501
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's him

502
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
He's coming

503
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Alfa

504
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Don't push Alfa

505
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
She's dangerous

506
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
What are you talking about, Purwa?

507
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You're the bad guy

508
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I came here to pray for Alfa

509
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Alfa

510
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What do you think?

511
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Who do you trust the most?

512
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I give you three minutes

513
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
To clean the page

514
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I work with the Ankara process

515
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Good, Alfa

516
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Now you help me attack him

517
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Let's attack him together

518
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You're a coward

519
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You shouldn't be in this school

520
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Alfa, help me

521
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Alfa, he's over there

522
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Alfa

523
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm sorry, Professor Purwa

524
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But I won't let anyone

525
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
To disturb my important mission

526
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
To take the stone of eternity

527
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Why are you surprised like that, Alfa?

528
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes

529
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm the culprit

530
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Professor

531
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I'm the culprit

532
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I took the stone of eternity

533
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
To give it to the 8th prince

534
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So

535
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I hypnotized Professor Agni

536
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
By using the body of Professor Purwa

537
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So I can make Alfa

538
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Take the stone of eternity

539
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Alfa

540
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I protect you

541
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
With your friends

542
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So you can trust me

543
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And you can suspect Professor Purwa

544
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I have disguised myself as Professor Agni

545
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
To take the stone of eternity easily

546
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And lastly

547
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I used your life again, Purwa

548
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
To defeat you

549
00:45:47,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I swear

550
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
The 8th prince will rise again

551
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
His power will recover

552
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And you will all be destroyed

553
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The destruction of this school

554
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Will start with you

555
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But

556
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The first one I will destroy is you

557
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Alfa

558
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Are you sure you want to fight me?

559
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The power you have

560
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Is nothing compared to the power I have

561
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm a bad person

562
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I won't let anyone hurt you

563
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Professor

564
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
If he comes

565
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I will destroy you both

566
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Professor Alibaran

567
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It's too late, Mr. Diah

568
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Forgive me, Professor Purwa

569
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Because I accused you wrongly

570
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Your actions are very reckless, Alfa

571
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You could have been killed

572
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Attention, everyone

573
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Please listen to this important news

574
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
As you know

575
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The Stone of Eternity has been stolen

576
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But now

577
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
With a happy heart I inform you that

578
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The thief has been caught

579
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Now

580
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I will call a child

581
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Who has helped us find the thief

582
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Alfa

583
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,000

584
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And from now on

585
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The school has decided

586
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
If Alfa

587
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Will not be expelled from the school

588
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And even

589
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
The school will give

590
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Alfa a medal

591
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
For all her services

592
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Congratulations

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000

00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,120
Bouncing in the dark dreams

596
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:42,780
Be brave, don't give up

00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:20,880
We can do it

610
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:36,820
Go, go, go!

611
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,300
Achieve all your dreams

612
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,300
