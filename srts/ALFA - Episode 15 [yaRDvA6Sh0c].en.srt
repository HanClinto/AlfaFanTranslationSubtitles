 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, fight with your heart

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Your power is not comparable to mine

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 You come with me

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Let me go, let me go, you're evil

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 The power of the star girl is at night

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You can burn with her light

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 We wait until tomorrow

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Tomorrow morning, I will get the power of the star girl

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So it's true, the fallen star girl is the one who will be the one to destroy the world

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 The fallen star girl is in our school

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Yes, professor

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I asked her to stay at the school tower

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But because of professor Angkara, she was kidnapped

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 We have to go there immediately

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Before Angkara takes the power of the fallen star girl

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Yes, professor

 [The power of the fallen star girl]

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:21,000

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:45,000

 [The power of the fallen star girl]

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Come out

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 That person is...

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 The star girl, our teacher

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Come out

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It turns out that he is the one behind all this

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 He wants to take Selena's heart

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I have to stop him

 Don't let him drink the eye drops that have been mixed with my hair.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Because it can cure all his diseases.

177

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Give me the eye drops.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I've cut your eyelashes.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

00:10:37,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Alva!

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Alva!

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Alva!

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He's drinking my eye drops!

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Alva!

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Alva!

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Alva!

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 What are you attacking?

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I'm stronger now.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Your eye drops will never be able to hurt me.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Alva, it's broken!

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Now, it's time for me to take the star girl's heart.

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 With my power, my power will never be limited.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 It's broken!

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I have to find a way to differentiate the real and cloned Rion.

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I'm sorry, Zai!

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Megantara.

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Remember, Ankara will never appear in the mirror.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Once we see the real Ankara, we attack together.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Watch this!

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000

223
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Lightning!

225
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Lightning!

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Megantara, let's go.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Let's find Ava.

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Let's go.

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Please, please, Daniel.

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 I want to go back to the past.

235
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I'm not ready to be a great leader in Jogja.

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Zai!

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

238
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 What's going on?

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 My body is getting thinner.

240
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Ava!

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Where are you, Ava?

242
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 We have to get out of here.

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

244
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Professor, the army is here.

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Ava, Ava!

246
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 You met the fallen star girl.

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Yes, Professor.

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Let's get out of here.

249
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Wait, soldier.

250
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 We have to save Jebi.

251
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Because the dark energy is getting stronger.

252
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 She has managed to cut off Selena's hair.

253
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And she has managed to suck out Selena's tears.

254
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It's okay.

255
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Let's get Selena out of here.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Let's go.

257
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 We're here.

259
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Thank you, Alva.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 You fulfilled your promise.

261
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 So I can go back to space.

262
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And thank you, Megantara, for your help.

263
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Goodbye, Alva.

264
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Don't forget to send my regards to Vega, Ray, and Plita.

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 I'm so happy to be able to meet you.

266
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Yes, goodbye.

267
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 I'll be back soon.

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

269
00:18:35,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Let's go back to school.

270
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

271
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

272
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Alva, Professor Ade is hurt.

273
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Hurry, take her to the school.

274
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Megantara.

275
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I'll face this darkness.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Hurry, Alva.

277
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

278
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I'm sorry, everyone.

279
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 It's not good, Sir.

280
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 The army is coming.

281
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 They're so strong.

282
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Alva, watch out.

283
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 He's running away.

284
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Don't let him get away.

285
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Professor Ade.

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

287
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Professor Ade.

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Watch out.

289
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 It's useless to fight him.

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 You'll never win.

291
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Alva, let's go.

292
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 We're almost there.

293
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

294
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Good.

295
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Let's go, Vega.

296
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Ray, Melita.

297
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Keep attacking.

298
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Megantara.

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Alva.

300
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Megantara.

301
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Alva.

302
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Keep attacking.

303
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 What do we do now, Sir?

304
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 What do we do?

305
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Don't be fooled.

306
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 There's a very important task for you.

307
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 What task, Megantara?

308
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Let's go.

309
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Save the girl.

310
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 [The power of the fallen star girl]

311
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Professor Ade.

312
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Professor Ade is bleeding.

313
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Professor Ade is bleeding.

314
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 What happened to him?

315
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 He has a bad face.

316
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Yes.

317
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 He was attacked.

318
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 We have to take him to the clinic.

319
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Hurry.

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Let's check with Dr. Pertiwi.

321
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Come on.

322
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Hurry.

323
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Professor Ade.

324
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Professor Ade.

325
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Professor Ade.

326
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Professor Ade.

327
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Let's go to Dr. Pertiwi's clinic.

328
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Hurry.

329
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Let's go.

330
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Angga.

331
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Angga.

332
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 It's like the voice of the God.

333
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Angga.

334
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I'm coming, Sir.

335
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Hang in there.

336
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Hang in there.

337
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It's bad.

338
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 It seems like Professor Ade is too weak to walk.

339
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Vega, prepare the pole.

340
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Okay, Sir.

341
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Ready.

342
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Fire.

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Fire.

344
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Angga.

345
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Angga.

346
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Angga.

347
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Angga.

348
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Angga.

349
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Angga.

350
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Angga.

351
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Angga.

352
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Prepare the food.

353
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 What happened, Sir?

354
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 The mutant has returned to its original form.

355
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 But I managed to locate Aldebaran.

356
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I'm sure,

357
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 he will die soon.

358
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 I have a task for you.

359
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Yes, Sir.

360
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I will do it.

361
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Professor Aldebaran.

362
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 What happened?

363
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 We can do it.

364
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 We can do it.

365
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 S5.

366
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Young coconut.

367
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Let's go.

368
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 What is that light?

369
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 It's bright.

370
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 What kind of light is that?

371
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
