1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Your power is not comparable to mine

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You come with me

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let me go, let me go, you're evil

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The power of the star girl is at night

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can burn with her light

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We wait until tomorrow

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tomorrow morning, I will get the power of the star girl

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's true, the fallen star girl is the one who will be the one to destroy the world

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fallen star girl is in our school

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, professor

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I asked her to stay at the school tower

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But because of professor Angkara, she was kidnapped

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We have to go there immediately

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Before Angkara takes the power of the fallen star girl

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, professor

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, it's time for me to take the power of the fallen star girl

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will destroy you

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who are you?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Come out

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That person is...

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The star girl, our teacher

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come out

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It turns out that he is the one behind all this

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He wants to take Selena's heart

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have to stop him

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:06:46,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

42
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wake up! You have to get out of here!

43
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Star fairy!

44
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Star fairy, wake up!

45
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You have to get out of here!

46
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Star fairy!

47
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Star fairy! Wake up!

48
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Alva, I'm with your mother. I'm so scared.

49
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But we have to get out of here.

50
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alva, my hair! My hair is cut!

51
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, your eyelashes are also squeezed.

52
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

53
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Wait a minute.

54
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In a moment you will see my father's power.

55
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:51,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

56
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have to get rid of her eyelashes and hair now.

57
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
After that, I will become a star.

58
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

59
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Alva, you have to protect him.

60
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't let him drink the eye drops that have been mixed with my hair.

61
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because it can cure all his diseases.

62
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And he will be stronger.

63
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

64
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm going to cut your eyelashes.

65
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not as easy as you think.

66
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The basics can be disturbing.

67
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

68
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Give me the eye drops.

69
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I've cut your eyelashes.

70
00:10:26,000 --> 00:11:06,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

71
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alva!

72
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:27,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

73
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Alva!

74
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He's drinking my eye drops!

75
00:11:43,000 --> 00:12:14,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

76
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Alva!

77
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you attacking?

78
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm stronger now.

79
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your eye drops will never be able to hurt me.

80
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Alva, it's broken!

81
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now, it's time for me to take the star girl's heart.

82
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
With my power, my power will never be limited.

83
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's broken!

84
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:32,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

85
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to find a way to differentiate the real and cloned Rion.

86
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry, Zai!

87
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

88
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Megantara.

89
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Remember, Ankara will never appear in the mirror.

90
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Once we see the real Ankara, we attack together.

91
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Watch this!

92
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

93
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Lightning!

94
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

95
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Lightning!

96
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:38,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

97
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Megantara, let's go.

98
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Let's find Ava.

99
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's go.

100
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please, please, Daniel.

101
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I want to go back to the past.

102
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not ready to be a great leader in Jogja.

103
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Zai!

104
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

105
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What's going on?

106
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
My body is getting thinner.

107
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ava!

108
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Where are you, Ava?

109
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We have to get out of here.

110
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

111
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Professor, the army is here.

112
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Ava, Ava!

113
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You met the fallen star girl.

114
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes, Professor.

115
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's get out of here.

116
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wait, soldier.

117
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We have to save Jebi.

118
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because the dark energy is getting stronger.

119
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
She has managed to cut off Selena's hair.

120
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And she has managed to suck out Selena's tears.

121
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's okay.

122
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's get Selena out of here.

123
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's go.

124
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

125
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We're here.

126
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Thank you, Alva.

127
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You fulfilled your promise.

128
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I can go back to space.

129
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And thank you, Megantara, for your help.

130
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Goodbye, Alva.

131
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't forget to send my regards to Vega, Ray, and Plita.

132
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm so happy to be able to meet you.

133
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, goodbye.

134
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll be back soon.

135
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

136
00:18:35,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Let's go back to school.

137
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

138
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Alva, Professor Ade is hurt.

139
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hurry, take her to the school.

140
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Megantara.

141
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll face this darkness.

142
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hurry, Alva.

143
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

144
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry, everyone.

145
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's not good, Sir.

146
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The army is coming.

147
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They're so strong.

148
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Alva, watch out.

149
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He's running away.

150
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't let him get away.

151
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Professor Ade.

152
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

153
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Professor Ade.

154
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Watch out.

155
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's useless to fight him.

156
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You'll never win.

157
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Alva, let's go.

158
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We're almost there.

159
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

160
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Good.

161
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's go, Vega.

162
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Ray, Melita.

163
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Keep attacking.

164
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Megantara.

165
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Alva.

166

Megantara.

167

Alva.

168
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Keep attacking.

169
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What do we do now, Sir?

170
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What do we do?

171
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't be fooled.

172
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There's a very important task for you.

173
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What task, Megantara?

174
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's go.

175
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Save the girl.

176
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

177
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Professor Ade.

178
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Professor Ade is bleeding.

179
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What happened to him?

180
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He has a bad face.

181
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes.

182
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He was attacked.

183
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We have to take him to the clinic.

184
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hurry.

185
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's check with Dr. Pertiwi.

186
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Come on.

187
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hurry.

Let's go to Dr. Pertiwi's clinic.

It's bad.

198

It seems like Professor Ade is too weak to walk.

The mutant has returned to its original form.

he will die soon.

Professor Aldebaran was attacked.

Professor Aldebaran is very well-educated.

254

And if someone can beat him,

255
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it means that person is very well-educated.
