1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb, climb the tower

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, achieve all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, fight with your heart

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Your power is not comparable to mine

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You come with me

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let me go, let me go, you're evil

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The power of the star girl is at night

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can burn with her light

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We wait until tomorrow

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tomorrow morning, I will get the power of the star girl

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's true, the fallen star girl is the one who will be the one to destroy the world

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fallen star girl is in our school

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, professor

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I asked her to stay at the school tower

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But because of professor Angkara, she was kidnapped

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We have to go there immediately

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Before Angkara takes the power of the fallen star girl

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, professor

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, it's time for me to take the power of the fallen star girl

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will destroy you

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who are you?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Come out

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That person is...

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The star girl, our teacher

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come out

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It turns out that he is the one behind all this

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He wants to take Selena's heart

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have to stop him

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:06:46,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

41
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wake up! You have to get out of here!

42
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Star fairy!

43
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Star fairy, wake up!

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You have to get out of here!

45
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Star fairy!

46
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Star fairy! Wake up!

47
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Alfa, I'm with your mother. I'm so scared.

48
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But we have to get out of here.

49
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alfa, my hair! My hair is cut!

50
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, your eyelashes are also squeezed.

51
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

52
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Wait a minute.

53
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In a moment you will see my father's power.

54
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:51,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

55
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have to get rid of her eyelashes and hair now.

56
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
After that, I will become a star.

57
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

58
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Alfa, you have to protect him.

59
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't let him drink the eye drops that have been mixed with my hair.

60
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because it can cure all his diseases.

61
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And he will be stronger.

62
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

63
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm going to cut your eyelashes.

64
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not as easy as you think.

65
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The basics can be disturbing.

66
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

67
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Give me the eye drops.

68
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I've cut your eyelashes.

69
00:10:26,000 --> 00:11:06,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

70
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alfa!

71
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:27,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

72
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Alfa!

73
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He's drinking my eye drops!

74
00:11:43,000 --> 00:12:14,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

75
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Alfa!

76
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you attacking?

77
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm stronger now.

78
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your eye drops will never be able to hurt me.

79
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Alfa, it's broken!

80
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now, it's time for me to take the star girl's heart.

81
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
With my power, my power will never be limited.

82
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's broken!

83
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:32,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

84
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to find a way to differentiate the real and cloned Rion.

85
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry, Zai!

86
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

87
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Megantara.

88
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Remember, Ankara will never appear in the mirror.

89
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Once we see the real Ankara, we attack together.

90
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Watch this!

91
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

92
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Lightning!

93
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

94
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Lightning!

95
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:38,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

96
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Megantara, let's go.

97
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Let's find Ava.

98
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's go.

99
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please, please, Daniel.

100
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I want to go back to the past.

101
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not ready to be a great leader in Jogja.

102
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Zai!

103
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

104
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What's going on?

105
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
My body is getting thinner.

106
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ava!

107
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Where are you, Ava?

108
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We have to get out of here.

109
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

110
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Professor, the army is here.

111
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Ava, Ava!

112
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You met the fallen star girl.

113
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes, Professor.

114
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's get out of here.

115
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wait, soldier.

116
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We have to save Jebi.

117
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because the dark energy is getting stronger.

118
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
She has managed to cut off Selena's hair.

119
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And she has managed to suck out Selena's tears.

120
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's okay.

121
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's get Selena out of here.

122
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's go.

123
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

124
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We're here.

125
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Thank you, Alfa.

126
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You fulfilled your promise.

127
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I can go back to space.

128
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And thank you, Megantara, for your help.

129
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Goodbye, Alfa.

130
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't forget to send my regards to Vega, Ray, and Plita.

131
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm so happy to be able to meet you.

132
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, goodbye.

133
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll be back soon.

134
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

135
00:18:35,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Let's go back to school.

136
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

137
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Alfa, Professor Ade is hurt.

138
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hurry, take her to the school.

139
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Megantara.

140
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll face this darkness.

141
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hurry, Alfa.

142
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

143
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry, everyone.

144
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's not good, Sir.

145
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The army is coming.

146
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They're so strong.

147
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Alfa, watch out.

148
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He's running away.

149
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't let him get away.

150
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Professor Ade.

151
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

152
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Professor Ade.

153
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Watch out.

154
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's useless to fight him.

155
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You'll never win.

156
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Alfa, let's go.

157
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We're almost there.

158
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

159
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Good.

160
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's go, Vega.

161
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Ray, Melita.

162
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Keep attacking.

163
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Megantara.

164
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000

Alfa.

167
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Keep attacking.

168
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What do we do now, Sir?

169
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What do we do?

170
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't be fooled.

171
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There's a very important task for you.

172
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What task, Megantara?

173
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's go.

174
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Save the girl.

175
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

176
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Professor Ade.

177
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Professor Ade is bleeding.

178
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What happened to him?

179
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He has a bad face.

180
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes.

181
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He was attacked.

182
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We have to take him to the clinic.

183
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hurry.

184
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's check with Dr. Pertiwi.

185
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Come on.

186
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hurry.

187
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Professor Ade.

188
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let's go to Dr. Pertiwi's clinic.

189
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hurry.

190
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Let's go.

191
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Angga.

192
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's like the voice of the God.

193
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Angga.

194
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm coming, Sir.

195
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hang in there.

196
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's bad.

197
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It seems like Professor Ade is too weak to walk.

198
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Vega, prepare the pole.

199
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay, Sir.

200
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Ready.

201
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Fire.

202
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Angga.

203
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Prepare the food.

204
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What happened, Sir?

205
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The mutant has returned to its original form.

206
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I managed to locate Aldebaran.

207
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm sure,

208
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
he will die soon.

209
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I have a task for you.

210
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes, Sir.

211
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I will do it.

212
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Professor Aldebaran.

213
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What happened?

214
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We can do it.

215
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
S5.

216
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Young coconut.

217
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Let's go.

218
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What is that light?

219
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's bright.

220
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What kind of light is that?

221
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
OMG.

222
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Amazing.

223
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is mushroom centurion tea.

224
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's a very rare mushroom.

225
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It can cure all diseases.

226
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
All diseases.

227
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But why is it here?

228
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Isn't it in the cradle?

229
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's go.

230
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's moving.

231
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Hey, mushroom centurion.

232
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Don't go.

233
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't go with me.

234
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's gone.

235
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
OMG.

236
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, no.

237
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hello, Ibu.

238
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I have a request for you.

239
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And you have to do as I command.

240
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Damn it.

241
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The data.

242
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hurry up.

243
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay.

244
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Sir, we need help.

245
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Let's go.

246
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't go.

247
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Professor Aldebaran.

248
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What happened?

249
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Professor Aldebaran was attacked.

250
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Professor Aldebaran is very well-educated.

251
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And if someone can beat him,

252
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it means that person is very well-educated.

253
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We'll talk about it later.

254
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Now we have to treat Professor Aldebaran.

255
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Let's go to the cradle.

256
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Where is the cradle?

257
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's not here.

258
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You even use vegetables.

259
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
When you're in need,

260
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you use the cradle.

261
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay, let me find it.

262
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Cradle,

263
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
where did you get it?

264
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
OMG.

265
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Professor Aldebaran is old.

266
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Why?

267
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Don't ask too much.

268
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Immediately perform a sedative on Professor Aldebaran.

269
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh my God.

270
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This wound is very bad.

271
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Very, very bad.

272
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And must be treated immediately with energy transfer.

273
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Pedang Kramat Purnama.

274
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Pedang Kramat Purnama?

275
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, where is Pedang Kramat Purnama?

276
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Alfa,

277
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Pedang Kramat Purnama is in an old castle in the forest at the end of the school.

278
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Ask Alfa to take the Pedang Pusaka Purnama.

279
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Remember,

280
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
only Alfa.

281
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No teacher can accompany her.

282
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Do you understand?

283
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Alfa,

284
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
you better look for it,

285
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
so that Professor Aldebaran can be treated immediately.

286
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Alfa,

287
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the Purnama castle is a very dangerous place.

288
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
There are many traps there.

289
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me go.

290
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Don, don't go.

291
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You teachers must stay here,

292
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
meditate.

293
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Okay.

294
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If so,

295
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm the one who needs to go.

296
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Don't, Megantara.

297
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You must stay here.

298
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay,

299
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm not going.

300
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, we too.

301
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Alfa,

302
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Professor Aldebaran.

303
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Prof,

304
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you don't go, Alfa.

305
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But, Prof,

306
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
No, sir.

307
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You don't have to go.

308
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's dangerous for you.

309
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Megantara,

310
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
if so, let me teach you to ask for help.

311
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No, Prof.

312
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I already know,

313
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
when I was kidnapped.

314
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay,

315
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
so,

316
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
we're going just the two of us.

317
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
There's me.

318
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Where are you?

319
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Here.

320
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's go.

321
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Guys,

322
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we have to hurry.

323
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes.

324
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Hurry.

325
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's the castle.

326
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Come on, guys.

327
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's go there.

328
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Let's go.

329
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Why are those kids coming?

330
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Why not Alfa?

331
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Alfa should be there.

332
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The Fatak Centurion.

333
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What should I do,

334
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Duran?

335
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Stop those kids.

336
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Don't let them in the castle.

337
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
What are you doing?

338
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Stop them.

339
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's...

340
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You haven't read the book, right?

341
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That's Centaurus.

342
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yes, this is Centaurus.

343
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
He's our hero.

344
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Watch out.

345
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Come here.

346
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
He's going to attack us.

347
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Help me, Turi.

348
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Hurry.

349
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm on the police car.

350
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Why are you attacking him with a spell?

351
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What spell are you using?

352
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What do you know?

353
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know.

354
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What spell are you using?

355
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Help me.

356
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What should we do?

357
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yes, what should we do?

358
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Everyone is in trouble.

359
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't laugh.

360
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes.

361
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Come here.

362
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Help me.

363
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
My body hurts.

364
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Help me.

365
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Ray, Tuli.

366
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You guys, watch him.

367
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm going to look for him in the book.

368
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
How to find him?

369
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But, how?

370
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay.

371
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hold me, Tuli.

372
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Okay.

373
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Come on, Tuli.

374
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Attack him.

375
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Come on, Tuli.

376
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Come here.

377
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Come on, Tuli.

378
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Come on.

379
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What should we do?

380
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Where is he?

381
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't know.

382
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Where is he?

383
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't know.

384
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Help me, Tuli.

385
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Hurry up.

386
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, no.

387
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Ray, I'm going to die.

388
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You're going to die.

389
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Be patient.

390
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Ray.

391
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Here he is.

392
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes, I know how to get rid of him.

393
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm going to kill you.

394
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes.

395
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Centaurus, come here.

396
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Attack me if you dare.

397
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Come here.

398
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Come here, Centaurus.

399
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Come here, fight me.

400
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Take this, Centaurus.

401
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yes, it's delicious.

402
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Hurray.

403
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Ouch.

404
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It hurts.

405
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Come here.

406
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Ouch.

407
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It hurts.

408
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes, I did it.

409
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You're a fool, Centaurus.

410
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm going to make the children regret it.

411
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You're done, Centaurus.

412
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Destroy them all.

413
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Come on, hurry up.

414
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yes.

415
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We have to find the sword.

416
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So that the professor can recover quickly.

417
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes.

418
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What is this castle?

419
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The forest is in a mess.

420
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
There must be something.

421
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
This is hard.

422
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This.

423
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Look, now you guys distract him.

424
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I can read the book.

425
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
How do we defeat him?

426
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So we don't become a burden.

427
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Shh.

428
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They think we're worms.

429
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't know.

430
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Don't talk too much.

431
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You don't want the professor to recover together, do you?

432
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yes.

433
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Eat this.

434
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
My meat is the best.

435
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
What is this?

436
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Take it.

437
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Where is it?

438
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
[Screaming]

439
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes, I did it.

440
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Come here.

441
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Hurry up, I want to take a picture.

442
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Okay.

443
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Come on.

444
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
[Screaming]

445
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Men are always like this.

446
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
There's no other way.

447
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You're right.

448
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There's no other way.

449
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Even if the professor is with me.

450
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Come on.

451
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Come here.

452
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
[Screaming]

453
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Fire.

454
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yes.

455
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It worked.

456
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
All my monsters are destroyed.

457
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The kids are too smart.

458
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I have to make a stronger monster.

459
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
[Screaming]

460
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Get the fire.

461
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I am...

462
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
...Burned.

463
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Destroy them all.

464
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Don't let them enter the castle.

465
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I am...

466
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
...Burned.

467
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
[Laughter]

468
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Maybe...

469
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
...they'll all be destroyed.

470
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
[Laughter]

471
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Rey, wake up.

472
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Rey.

473
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Rey, wake up.

474
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
What should I do?

475
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Rey, wake up.

476
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Monsters.

477
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
What happened to my monsters?

478
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Hit them.

479
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
[Grunts]

480
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
[Roar]

481
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
[Grunts]

482
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I am...

483
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
...Dead.

484
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Thank you.

485
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:54,000
[Roar]

486
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I am...

487
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I can't run anymore.

488
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I need help.

489
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I am being ordered.

490
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Help.

491
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Professor Ragni.

492
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Hold on.

493
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You have to be strong.

494
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Come on.

495
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We have to hold on.

496
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Stay together.

497
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Don't let the energy transfer be released.

498
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Because it can be a threat to the monster.

499
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Good evening, Professor.

500
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Good evening, Felita.

501
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I asked Koki...

502
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
...to cook for the professor.

503
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Koki said this food...

504
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
...can make the professor's power come back.

505
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But how do we eat it, Felita?

506
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I can't let go of this.

507
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Okay.

508
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'll help you, Professor.

509
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Come on, Felita.

510
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Give it a big bite.

511
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
[Groan]

512
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Again.

513
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Felita.

514
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Where is Professor Atomi?

515
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm worried.

516
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm walking around.

517
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I don't know what to do.

518
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Where is he?

519
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:05,000
They failed.

520
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I have to help them.

521
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Professor has changed.

522
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
He's huge.

523
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
This is...

524
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
...aquafl...

525
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Calm down.

526
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I want to feed you.

527
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Let me.

528
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm Megantara.

529
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yes.

530
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Megantara.

531
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I need your help.

532
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Can I?

533
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Let me go.

534
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Vega.

535
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Vega, wake up.

536
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Wake up, Vega.

537
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Vega.

538
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Where is Rey and Tole?

539
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Rey and Tole are there.

540
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Rey, Tole.

541
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Wake up, Rey.

542
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Rey, Tole.

543
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Wake up.

544
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Rey, wake up.

545
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Alpha.

546
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm here.

547
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Go home.

548
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Help me.

549
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Hurry up.

550
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Why are we going up?

551
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Seriously, Alpha.

552
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You have to go home.

553
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
No.

554
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I don't want you to be a victim.

555
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't want to leave you.

556
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Naga.

557
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Take them to school.

558
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Good, Alpha.

559
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You're getting closer.

560
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Finally.

561
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
The special kid is here.

562
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You're showing your true power, Alpha.

563
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
[Laughter]

564
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
[Roar]

565
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
What's that?

566
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
[Roar]

567
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Why is he showing us the way?

568
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Vega said,

569
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
The monster is dangerous.

570
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But I don't think it's dangerous.

571
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Or maybe it's a trap.

572
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Let's try.

573
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
[Roar]

574
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Why am I brought here?

575
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I am...

576
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Varga.

577
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I...

578
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Want to be remembered, Alpha.

579
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Remembered?

580
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yes.

581
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Remembered, Alpha.

582
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Let me go.

583
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Where are you taking me?

584
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Let me go.

585
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I...

586
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Want to be remembered, Alpha.

587
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
What does he want?

588
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Why is he holding me?

589
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Monster!

590
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
[Laughter]

591
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yesterday, I've found the power of the fallen star.

592
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And now,

593
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I will find the power of the chosen one.

594
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
[Laughter]

595
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That way, I will be a great warrior.

596
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And my power is unlimited.

597
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
[Laughter]

598
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Anggar.

599
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's up to you to do what I want.

600
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
To destroy Albaran.

601
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
[Laughter]

602
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
*laughing*

603
00:58:24,000 --> 01:02:55,260
[music]
