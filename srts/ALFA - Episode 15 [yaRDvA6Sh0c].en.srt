You can burn with her light

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We wait until tomorrow

Tomorrow morning, I will get the power of the star girl

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's true, the fallen star girl is the one who will be the one to destroy the world

23

The fallen star girl is in our school

Yes, professor

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I asked her to stay at the school tower

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But because of professor Angkara, she was kidnapped

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We have to go there immediately

28

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The star girl, our teacher

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come out

Alfa, I'm with your mother. I'm so scared.

But we have to get out of here.

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alfa, my hair! My hair is cut!

53
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:40,000

55
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In a moment you will see my father's power.

[The power of the fallen star girl]

58

After that, I will become a star.

61
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:31,000

62

Don't let him drink the eye drops that have been mixed with my hair.

63
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because it can cure all his diseases.

64

It's not as easy as you think.

[The power of the fallen star girl]

73
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000

Alfa!

76
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He's drinking my eye drops!

77

[The power of the fallen star girl]

78
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Alfa!

79
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you attacking?

80
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm stronger now.

81
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your eye drops will never be able to hurt me.

82
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Alfa, it's broken!

83
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now, it's time for me to take the star girl's heart.

84
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
With my power, my power will never be limited.

85
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's broken!

[The power of the fallen star girl]

87
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to find a way to differentiate the real and cloned Rion.

88
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry, Zai!

89
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

90
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Megantara.

91
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Remember, Ankara will never appear in the mirror.

92
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Once we see the real Ankara, we attack together.

93
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Watch this!

94

Let's go.

102
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please, please, Daniel.

103
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I want to go back to the past.

104
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not ready to be a great leader in Jogja.

105
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000

[The power of the fallen star girl]

107
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What's going on?

108
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
My body is getting thinner.

109
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ava!

110
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Where are you, Ava?

111
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We have to get out of here.

112
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
[The power of the fallen star girl]

113
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Professor, the army is here.

114
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Ava, Ava!

115
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You met the fallen star girl.

116
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes, Professor.

117
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's get out of here.

118
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wait, soldier.

119
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We have to save Jebi.

120
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because the dark energy is getting stronger.

121
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
She has managed to cut off Selena's hair.

122
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And she has managed to suck out Selena's tears.

123
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's okay.

124
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's get Selena out of here.

125
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000

127

You fulfilled your promise.

130
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I can go back to space.

Hurry, take her to the school.

Megantara.

143
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll face this darkness.

It's not good, Sir.

148

The army is coming.

149
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They're so strong.

150
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Alfa, watch out.

151
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He's running away.

152
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't let him get away.

153
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Professor Ade.

Watch out.

157
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's useless to fight him.

158
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You'll never win.

159
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Alfa, let's go.

160
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We're almost there.

Good.

163
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's go, Vega.

164
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Ray, Melita.

165
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Keep attacking.

What do we do now, Sir?

172

What do we do?

173
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't be fooled.

174

There's a very important task for you.

175

What task, Megantara?

176
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's go.

177

Professor Ade is bleeding.

181

What happened to him?

182
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He has a bad face.

He was attacked.

185
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We have to take him to the clinic.

186
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hurry.

187
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's check with Dr. Pertiwi.

188
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Come on.

189
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hurry.

190
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Professor Ade.

191
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let's go to Dr. Pertiwi's clinic.

192
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hurry.

193
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Let's go.

194
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Angga.

195
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's like the voice of the God.

196
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Angga.

197
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm coming, Sir.

198
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hang in there.

199
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's bad.

200
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It seems like Professor Ade is too weak to walk.

201
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Vega, prepare the pole.

202
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay, Sir.

203
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Ready.

204
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Fire.

205
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Angga.

206
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Prepare the food.

207
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What happened, Sir?

208
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The mutant has returned to its original form.

209
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I managed to locate Aldebaran.

210
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm sure,

211
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
he will die soon.

212
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I have a task for you.

213
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes, Sir.

214
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I will do it.

215
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Professor Aldebaran.

216
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What happened?

217
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We can do it.

218
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
S5.

219
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Young coconut.

220
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Let's go.

221
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What is that light?

222
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's bright.

223
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What kind of light is that?

224
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
OMG.

225
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Amazing.

226
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is mushroom centurion tea.

227
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's a very rare mushroom.

228
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It can cure all diseases.

229
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
All diseases.

230
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But why is it here?

231
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Isn't it in the cradle?

232
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's go.

233
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's moving.

234
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Hey, mushroom centurion.

235
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Don't go.

236
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't go with me.

237
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's gone.

238
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
OMG.

239
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, no.

240
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hello, Ibu.

241
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I have a request for you.

242
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And you have to do as I command.

243
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Damn it.

244
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The data.

245
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hurry up.

246
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay.

247
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Sir, we need help.

248
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Let's go.

249
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't go.

250
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Professor Aldebaran.

251
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What happened?

252
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Professor Aldebaran was attacked.

253
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Professor Aldebaran is very well-educated.

254
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And if someone can beat him,

255
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it means that person is very well-educated.

256
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We'll talk about it later.

257
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Now we have to treat Professor Aldebaran.

258
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Let's go to the cradle.

259
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Where is the cradle?

260
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's not here.

261
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You even use vegetables.

262
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
When you're in need,

263
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you use the cradle.

264
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay, let me find it.

265
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Cradle,

266
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
where did you get it?

267
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
OMG.

268
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Professor Aldebaran is old.

269
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Why?

270
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Don't ask too much.

271
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Immediately perform a sedative on Professor Aldebaran.

272
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh my God.

273
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This wound is very bad.

274
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Very, very bad.

275
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And must be treated immediately with energy transfer.

276
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Pedang Kramat Purnama.

277
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Pedang Kramat Purnama?

278
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, where is Pedang Kramat Purnama?

279
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Alfa,

280
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Pedang Kramat Purnama is in an old castle in the forest at the end of the school.

281
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Ask Alfa to take the Pedang Pusaka Purnama.

282
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Remember,

283
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
only Alfa.

284
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No teacher can accompany her.

285
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Do you understand?

286
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Alfa,

287
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
you better look for it,

288
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
so that Professor Aldebaran can be treated immediately.

289
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Alfa,

290
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the Purnama castle is a very dangerous place.

291
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
There are many traps there.

292
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me go.

293
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Don, don't go.

294
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You teachers must stay here,

295
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
meditate.

296
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Okay.

297
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If so,

298
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm the one who needs to go.

299
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Don't, Megantara.

300
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You must stay here.

301
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay,

302
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm not going.

303
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, we too.

304
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Alfa,

305
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Professor Aldebaran.

306
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Prof,

307
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you don't go, Alfa.

308
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But, Prof,

309
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
No, sir.

310
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You don't have to go.

311
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's dangerous for you.

312
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Megantara,

313
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
if so, let me teach you to ask for help.

314
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No, Prof.

315
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I already know,

316
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
when I was kidnapped.

317
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay,

318
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
so,

319
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
we're going just the two of us.

320
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
There's me.

321
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Where are you?

322
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Here.

323
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's go.

324
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Guys,

325
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we have to hurry.

326
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes.

327
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Hurry.

328
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's the castle.

329
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Come on, guys.

330
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's go there.

331
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Let's go.

332
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Why are those kids coming?

333
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Why not Alfa?

334
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Alfa should be there.

335
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The Fatak Centurion.

336
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What should I do,

337
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Duran?

338
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Stop those kids.

339
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Don't let them in the castle.

340
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
What are you doing?

341
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Stop them.

342
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's...

343
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You haven't read the book, right?

344
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That's Centaurus.

345
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yes, this is Centaurus.

346
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
He's our hero.

347
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Watch out.

348
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Come here.

349
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
He's going to attack us.

350
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Help me, Turi.

351
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Hurry.

352
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm on the police car.

353
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Why are you attacking him with a spell?

354
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What spell are you using?

355
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What do you know?

356
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know.

357
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What spell are you using?

358
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Help me.

359
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What should we do?

360
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yes, what should we do?

361
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Everyone is in trouble.

362
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't laugh.

363
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes.

364
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Come here.

365
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Help me.

366
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
My body hurts.

367
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Help me.

368
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Ray, Tuli.

369
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You guys, watch him.

370
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm going to look for him in the book.

371
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
How to find him?

372
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But, how?

373
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay.

374
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Hold me, Tuli.

375
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Okay.

376
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Come on, Tuli.

377
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Attack him.

378
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Come on, Tuli.

379
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Come here.

380
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Come on, Tuli.

381
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Come on.

382
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What should we do?

383
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Where is he?

384
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't know.

385
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Where is he?

386
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't know.

387
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Help me, Tuli.

388
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Hurry up.

389
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, no.

390
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Ray, I'm going to die.

391
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You're going to die.

392
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Be patient.

393
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Ray.

394
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Here he is.

395
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes, I know how to get rid of him.

396
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm going to kill you.

397
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes.

398
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Centaurus, come here.

399
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Attack me if you dare.

400
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Come here.

401
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Come here, Centaurus.

402
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Come here, fight me.

403
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Take this, Centaurus.

404
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yes, it's delicious.

405
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Hurray.

406
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Ouch.

407
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It hurts.

408
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Come here.

409
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Ouch.

410
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It hurts.

411
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes, I did it.

412
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You're a fool, Centaurus.

413
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm going to make the children regret it.

414
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You're done, Centaurus.

415
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Destroy them all.

416
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Come on, hurry up.

417
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yes.

418
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We have to find the sword.

419
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So that the professor can recover quickly.

420
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yes.

421
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What is this castle?

422
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The forest is in a mess.

423
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
There must be something.

424
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
This is hard.

425
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This.

426
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Look, now you guys distract him.

427
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I can read the book.

428
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
How do we defeat him?

429
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So we don't become a burden.

430
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Shh.

431
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They think we're worms.

432
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't know.

433
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Don't talk too much.

434
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You don't want the professor to recover together, do you?

435
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yes.

436
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Eat this.

437
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
My meat is the best.

438
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
What is this?

439
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Take it.

440
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Where is it?

441
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
[Screaming]

442
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes, I did it.

443
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Come here.

444
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Hurry up, I want to take a picture.

445
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Okay.

446
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Come on.

447
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
[Screaming]

448
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Men are always like this.

449
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
There's no other way.

450
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You're right.

451
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There's no other way.

452
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Even if the professor is with me.

453
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Come on.

454
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Come here.

455
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
[Screaming]

456
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Fire.

457
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yes.

458
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It worked.

459
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
All my monsters are destroyed.

460
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The kids are too smart.

461
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I have to make a stronger monster.

462
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
[Screaming]

463
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Get the fire.

464
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I am...

465
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
...Burned.

466
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Destroy them all.

467
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Don't let them enter the castle.

468
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I am...

469
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
...Burned.

470
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
[Laughter]

471
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Maybe...

472
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
...they'll all be destroyed.

473
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
[Laughter]

474
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Rey, wake up.

475
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Rey.

476
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Rey, wake up.

477
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
What should I do?

478
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Rey, wake up.

479
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Monsters.

480
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
What happened to my monsters?

481
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Hit them.

482
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
[Grunts]

483
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
[Roar]

484
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
[Grunts]

485
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I am...

486
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
...Dead.

487
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Thank you.

488
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:54,000
[Roar]

489
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I am...

490
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I can't run anymore.

491
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I need help.

492
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I am being ordered.

493
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Help.

494
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Professor Ragni.

495
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Hold on.

496
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You have to be strong.

497
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Come on.

498
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We have to hold on.

499
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Stay together.

500
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Don't let the energy transfer be released.

501
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Because it can be a threat to the monster.

502
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Good evening, Professor.

503
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Good evening, Felita.

504
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I asked Koki...

505
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
...to cook for the professor.

506
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Koki said this food...

507
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
...can make the professor's power come back.

508
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But how do we eat it, Felita?

509
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I can't let go of this.

510
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Okay.

511
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'll help you, Professor.

512
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Come on, Felita.

513
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Give it a big bite.

514
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
[Groan]

515
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Again.

516
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Felita.

517
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Where is Professor Atomi?

518
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm worried.

519
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm walking around.

520
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I don't know what to do.

521
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Where is he?

522
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:05,000
They failed.

523
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I have to help them.

524
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Professor has changed.

525
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
He's huge.

526
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
This is...

527
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
...aquafl...

528
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Calm down.

529
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I want to feed you.

530
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Let me.

531
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm Megantara.

532
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yes.

533
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Megantara.

534
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I need your help.

535
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Can I?

536
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Let me go.

537
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Vega.

538
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Vega, wake up.

539
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Wake up, Vega.

540
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Vega.

541
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Where is Rey and Tole?

542
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Rey and Tole are there.

543
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Rey, Tole.

544
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Wake up, Rey.

545
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Rey, Tole.

546
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Wake up.

547
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Rey, wake up.

548
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Alpha.

549
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm here.

550
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Go home.

551
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Help me.

552
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Hurry up.

553
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Why are we going up?

554
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Seriously, Alpha.

555
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You have to go home.

556
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
No.

557
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I don't want you to be a victim.

558
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't want to leave you.

559
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Naga.

560
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Take them to school.

561
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Good, Alpha.

562
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You're getting closer.

563
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Finally.

564
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
The special kid is here.

565
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You're showing your true power, Alpha.

566
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
[Laughter]

567
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
[Roar]

568
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
What's that?

569
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
[Roar]

570
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Why is he showing us the way?

571
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Vega said,

572
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
The monster is dangerous.

573
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But I don't think it's dangerous.

574
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Or maybe it's a trap.

575
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Let's try.

576
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
[Roar]

577
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Why am I brought here?

578
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I am...

579
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Varga.

580
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I...

581
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Want to be remembered, Alpha.

582
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Remembered?

583
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yes.

584
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Remembered, Alpha.

585
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Let me go.

586
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Where are you taking me?

587
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Let me go.

588
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I...

589
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Want to be remembered, Alpha.

590
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
What does he want?

591
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Why is he holding me?

592
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Monster!

593
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
[Laughter]

594
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yesterday, I've found the power of the fallen star.

595
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And now,

596
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I will find the power of the chosen one.

597
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
[Laughter]

598
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That way, I will be a great warrior.

599
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And my power is unlimited.

600
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
[Laughter]

601
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Anggar.

602
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's up to you to do what I want.

603
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
To destroy Albaran.

604
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
[Laughter]

605
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
*laughing*

606
00:58:24,000 --> 01:02:55,260
[music]
