1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Be brave, don't give up

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chase your dreams and hopes

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go, go, go, never stop

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Go, go, go, run with courage

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, go, go, make yourself proud

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Go, go, go, let's dream

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Go, go, go, we can do it

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go, go, go, never stop

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That kid...

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He took my blood, Alfa!

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hit him!

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I didn't expect that I could get the Dark Lord's blood

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Finally, the holy blood is back to me

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Go, it's time for you to go

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come on, professor, what are you waiting for?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Finally, I can be free from the fire prison

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Shut up!

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How dare you to mess with us?

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will kill you all

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Beautiful queen, the jewelry you gave us is much better

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And much more luxurious than the necklace you're wearing now

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, it's better if you give us the necklace

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Your jewelry is beautiful

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I don't want to trade it for my soul stone

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This prison is priceless

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
As far as you know, it's been 1,500 years

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh my, this is dangerous

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All the rumors, even my pride, are worthless

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's going on?

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why is everything black?

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, professor

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When Angkar was the headmaster here

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He told him to change the color to black

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Angkar?

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He even changed the curriculum at school

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He told the teachers to teach black science to the children

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Angkar is too much

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Angkar!

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank God, professor

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now the classroom and classroom are back to normal

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Angkar will not like all this

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Unfortunately, Angkar will never see this place again

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Because I will not let him set foot in this school again

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What should we do, professor?

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
With a mantra, of course

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What else?

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
[The Mantra]

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What's that dust, professor?

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is not just any dust, Agni

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I think I've heard of that dust

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's the dust of protection, professor

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right, Agni

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dear dust of protection

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Protect the school and the children

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
From a man named Angkar

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
[The Mantra]

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I hope that dust will not control this place again, professor

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I guarantee that it will never happen

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's good, professor

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Any news from Megantara?

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Not yet

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm still waiting for the news

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sir, sir

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I swear, sir

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have nothing to do with these kids, sir

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't want to hear any more of your betrayal, Angkar

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Now, accept your punishment, Angkar

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
[The Mantra]

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If they don't have a thing for you

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They will never want you, Angkar

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Sir, I don't know, sir

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
[The Mantra]

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I told you, don't protect me!

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But if you don't protect me, you will die

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't care!

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I told you, don't protect me!

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But, sir

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If you don't protect me, Angkar

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hey, enough!

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Stay away from me!

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Maybe

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You will never be able to avoid it again

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Professor!

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Get out of the way!

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But, Meg, I was killed by a dark force

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's okay, I'm still alive

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's okay, we're still alive

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We can go to school

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But, how?

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, this letter

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's from Professor Lebaran

96
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Vega, keep this

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is this, sir?

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's a miracle letter

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
When you're in trouble or lost

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can light that letter

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And it will bring you back to school

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You will all be destroyed

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
[The Dark Force]

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Professor!

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Angkara!

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't be afraid

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They're about to escape

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Be careful!

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yay, we're back to school!

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, let's go

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because of you

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm the name of the Dark Force

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't be stupid

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will punish you all

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What is this?

117
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Huh?

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Professor!

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What did I see?

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How can a professor be mentally ill?

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because this school must be chanted

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So that the professor can enter

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wait

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Who chanted this school?

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Me

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
[The Dark Force]

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Professor Lebaran

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Aldo Baran

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Aldo Baran escaped

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will not let Aldo Baran escape

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I will not let him escape

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
When can I see you again?

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I miss you so much

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Leon

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry

137
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can't keep my promise to you

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry

139
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I won't be a burden

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I've decided to be one of the teachers

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
To teach you

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The teacher is Agni

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Huh? Agni?

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is the story, Leon

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Orion!

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm here to save you

147
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Avantur!

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey!

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What are you doing here?

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Catch him!

151
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've got it, Sir Ling!

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
[The Dark Force]

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How are you?

154
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Who are you?

155
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why are you here?

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm here to save you

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Here's the drink

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:41,000
[The Dark Force]

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Agni betrayed me

160
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He used me to get revenge on you

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But he poisoned your teacher

162
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And he poisoned his best friend

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
His name is Adi Balad

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What?

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
My feet were poisoned?

166
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And?

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
How are my feet?

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Your feet are dead

169
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
[The Dark Force]

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You have to listen to me, Leon

171
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You have to get revenge, Leon

172
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You have to get revenge on Professor Agni and Professor Adi Balad

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because they all killed your grandfather

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
[The Dark Force]

175
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Your Highness

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Indeed

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The Kalung that you have been possessing

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Has been poisoned by the evil force

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you keep on possessing it

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then your heart will be possessed by the evil force

181
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't want to hear anything else

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Your Highness

183
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Actually, I don't want to tell you this either

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't feel good about you

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But if you keep on using it

186
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then you will become a weak leader

187
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Try it

188
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The queen is getting weaker, right?

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Right?

190
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What do you mean?

191
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You said I'm weak?

192
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Right?

194
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Try it

195
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Weak?

196
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Weak or weak?

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're rude

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Your Highness

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
How about this?

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
To prove whether the queen is weak or not

201
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We will have a competition

202
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A game of "Nasi Pindang"

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A trade on the street

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If I win

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then the Kalung will be mine

206
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But if the queen wins

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The Kalung will be the queen's

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Then the gold and jewelry that I brought to the queen

209
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Will be taken by the queen

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And the competition will be decided by the queen

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If I refuse

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Then I will lose before I even start

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Alright

214
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I agree

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Good

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I hope we win the war

217
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We will win the war

218
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Amen

219
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Then we will have a flying competition

220
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But you will lose

221
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You can't win against my daughter

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You can't win

223
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We will have a flying competition

224
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
As long as the queen knows

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That all the students in the magic school

226
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Are good at flying

227
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Who's afraid?

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I've returned the Kalung

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And I

230
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Will take back my share

231
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And kick you out of the school

232
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Come on, professor

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't let him get away

234
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Cut his side, professor

235
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Professor

236
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Finally

237
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
My top student is back

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Take him away

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Take my top student away

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I will win

241
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Go

242
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Power

243
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I will cut your head off

244
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Cool

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He's like a robot

246
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Professor

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Tolik

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're not the one who hugged me

249
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I forgot, professor

250
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Finally, professor is back

251
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We're so happy

252
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can meet us again

253
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We miss you so much

254
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm happy to meet you too

255
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And thank you

256
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
For taking care of this school

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Especially you, Lata

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Thank you

259
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Sir

260
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Where are you, sir?

261
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Sir

262
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I want to apologize, sir

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I want to explain everything, sir

264
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Sir

265
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Sir, here

266
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Open it

267
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Sir

268
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What are you doing?

269
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This is a punishment for you, Angkara

270
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
For betraying me

271
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Sir

272
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Please listen to me, sir

273
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I didn't mean to betray you, sir

274
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You got it all wrong, sir

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We're being tricked, sir

276
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't believe you anymore, Angkara

277
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You're so good

278
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're a coward

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you want to punish me

280
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's okay, sir

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm willing to do it

282
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Because

283
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't know where else to go, sir

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
If it's not back to you, sir

285
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Sir, Sirsir School has punished me, sir

286
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And

287
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The West has been burning my house

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In the whole school, sir

289
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So

290
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't go to school anymore, sir

291
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're a traitor

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes, sir

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Sir, please listen to me, sir

294
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I didn't mean to betray you, sir

295
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay, Angkara

296
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'll give you one more chance

297
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And if you succeed

298
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll forgive you

299
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And I'll help you to take that school back

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Sir, please

301
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Thank you so much, sir

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You're so kind, sir

303
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But if you fail

304
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The punishment will be worse than this

305
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay, sir

306
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I promise, sir

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This time I won't fail, sir

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,360
No one will hear you now!

309
00:20:39,360 --> 00:21:10,360
[music]

310
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Good, Leon! Good!

311
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Finally you understand the lesson I gave you, Leon.

312
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,360
You better be ready now.

313
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Now is your time.

314
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Eda!

315
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Queen Venus is really nice to all of us.

316
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
She has given us food,

317
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
drinks,

318
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
and shelter.

319
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Soon, she will give me her heart.

320
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
So sweet!

321
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Guys,

322
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,360
are you sure we can defeat Queen Venus?

323
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,360
That's why

324
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,360
I will train you.

325
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Now, finish all of this food

326
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,360
so you have the strength to train.

327
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Yes, sir! / Yes, sir! / Okay, then.

328
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Guys,

329
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
let's go!

330
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Let's go!

331
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I'll go now.

332
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
Aren't you going to join us?

333
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
No.

334
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Let's go! Let's eat!

335
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Save some for me.

336
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Ready, sir!

337
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
[music]

338
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Buy a helmet.

339
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
An antique color.

340
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Beautiful ladies.

341
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Hi, sir.

342
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Sir?

343
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,360
This piece of art is divided into two.

344
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
How can a handsome man like this

345
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
be called sir?

346
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Beautiful ladies,

347
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
don't be shy.

348
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
You can call me

349
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Megantara's sister,

350
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
or Megantara's brother.

351
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,360
But if it's the right one,

352
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
call me

353
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
A-A Megantara.

354
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Yes, sir.

355
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Can I ask you something?

356
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Here's the thing.

357
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Are you happy

358
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
using that wing?

359
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Of course.

360
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,360
This wing can make us fly high and fast.

361
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Wow!

362
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,360
How fast can you fly?

363
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Very fast.

364
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Can I see

365
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,360
how fast you can fly?

366
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
For example,

367
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
you can fly from here,

368
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
to the palace,

369
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
and back here.

370
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Can you do that?

371
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Yes, sir.

372
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Here it is.

373
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Stopwatch.

374
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Here's the thing.

375
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,360
When I press the button,

376
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
you'll fly.

377
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Ready?

378
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,360
One, two, three.

379
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:42,360
Why are you still here?

380
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
You said you wanted to fly.

381
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Why haven't you flown yet?

382
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
When I press the button,

383
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
you'll fly.

384
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,360
You've flown.

385
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
You're back again.

386
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,360
You flew to the palace,

387
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
and then back again.

388
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Only five seconds.

389
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Can you do that?

390
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Kids,

391
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
to remind you that

392
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Professor Aldebaran is back,

393
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
we'll have a party today.

394
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,360
And all the classes will be canceled.

395
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Yay!

396
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:35,360
You're smiling.

397
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Kids,

398
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,360
to make this party more complete,

399
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,360
I'll give you a feast

400
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,360
that you'll never refuse.

401
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,360
The brownie!

402
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,360
It's so good!

403
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
I want more!

404
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Yum yum.

405
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Let's eat it all.

406
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,360
It's so good.

407
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Sorry, I'm late.

408
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Panji?

409
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Professor Aldebaran,

410
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
my favorite teacher.

411
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
How are you?

412
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
I'm fine, Panji.

413
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,360
It's been a while since we met.

414
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
But,

415
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
how did you get here?

416
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,360
The kids brought me here.

417
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Come on, please.

418
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Thank you.

419
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
(The kids brought me here)

420
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,360
There you go.

421
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Where's my brother?

422
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,360
I think he asked us to go to the toilet.

423
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Right.

424
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Where's my brother?

425
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Let's find him.

426
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Where are you going?

427
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
(The kids brought me here)

428
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Where are you from?

429
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I've been looking for you.

430
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
You're here.

431
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
What are you doing here?

432
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
I don't know.

433
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I don't know what I'm doing.

434
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
If you're not going to eat,

435
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
why are you here?

436
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Let's eat.

437
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
No.

438
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
I'm not hungry.

439
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
You're crying, aren't you?

440
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,360
No, I'm not crying.

441
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
You're lying.

442
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
It turns out your eyes and mouth are red.

443
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
What are you thinking?

444
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,360
You're thinking about your brother, aren't you?

445
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Yes, Vega.

446
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,360
I should be able to hug them now.

447
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,360
I should be able to joke with them.

448
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,360
I should be able to talk to them.

449
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,360
But everything failed.

450
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Because I haven't got the 8th Pangeran blood.

451
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
It's okay, Ava.

452
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Be patient.

453
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Maybe you'll get it with your family.

454
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,360
But I'm sure you'll get it.

455
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,360
I'm not strong enough.

456
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Yes.

457
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
I'm strong.

458
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Yes.

459
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:07,360
This school will be destroyed...

460
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
...by Leo.

461
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Mik, Octav, let's go.

462
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Try harder.

463
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Faster.

464
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Erik.

465
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Fija.

466
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
Come on.

467
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Show your abilities.

468
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
You have to be faster.

469
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,360
Fija, did you hear what the soldiers said?

470
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
I heard it.

471
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
We have to be faster.

472
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Let's speed up.

473
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,360
(The soldiers are getting tired)

474
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Soldiers.

475
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Let's take a rest.

476
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
We're tired.

477
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
Yes, soldiers.

478
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
I'm so weak.

479
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,360
Take a rest.

480
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,360
You have to keep training.

481
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Because you're still far behind the soldiers.

482
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,360
How much time do we have?

483
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Your time.

484
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Only 15 minutes.

485
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,360
While the soldiers are only 5 seconds behind you.

486
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,360
The difference is still far.

487
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,360
It's not true, soldiers.

488
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
We can't win against Venus.

489
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Yes, soldiers.

490
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Please, don't give up.

491
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Remember.

492
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
You're the best students.

493
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
Don't give up.

494
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,360
You have to keep training until you succeed.

495
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Okay.

496
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,360
If you want to rest, go ahead.

497
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
But we'll train again.

498
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm going to go now.

499
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Where are you going?

500
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Semedi.

501
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Leon.

502
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,360
This is the school you have to destroy.

503
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,360
You'll be a student here.

504
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,360
And you'll change your identity.

505
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Your name is not Leon.

506
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
But Rionelo.

507
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
And you have to remember.

508
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,360
You can't use your power.

509
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Especially in front of your enemies.

510
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,360
If they find out, they can do anything to you.

511
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Just like they did to your grandfather.

512
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Do you understand, Leon?

513
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Do you understand, Rionelo?

514
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Yes.

515
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
And you, Ankara.

516
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
As long as he's in school, you're my friend.

517
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Sir.

518
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,360
I'm not disobeying you.

519
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,360
But I can't go back to school.

520
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Because the school holiday is coming.

521
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Calm down, Ankara.

522
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,360
I have a solution.

523
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
Change.

524
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Why am I a hamster?

525
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
Now you're in.

526
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Wow, you're right.

527
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,360
By changing into a hamster, I managed to pass this test.

528
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,360
The protection is only for humans named Ankara.

529
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
Not a hamster named Ankara.

530
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,360
You're smart.

531
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Okay, I'll change my identity to be a student.

532
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:43,360
I'm not a hamster.

533
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Why am I out again?

534
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
I told you, Ankara.

535
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,360
You're the only one who can get in if you change into a hamster.

536
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Okay, sir.

537
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Good afternoon, kids.

538
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Good afternoon, sir.

539
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Give me a smile.

540
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Welcome to Sekolah Sihir.

541
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
Let me introduce myself.

542
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
My name is Prof. Tintan.

543
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm sure you'll be happy to live here.

544
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Because the teachers here are kind, not arrogant...

545
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,360
...and have a high social status.

546
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Just like me.

547
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
I swear.

548
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Of course.

549
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,360
What a coincidence, Rio.

550
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,360
You can go to school here.

551
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Ankara.

552
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
You're a hamster again.

553
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Yes, sir.

554
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Sekolah Sihir

555
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Soon...

556
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,360
...this school will be destroyed...

557
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
...by Leo.

558
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:48,360
I don't give up.

559
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,360
I have to defeat the hamsters as soon as possible.

560
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,360
I'll try this.

561
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,360
So I can use the magic of rocket fire.

562
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Avivi, rocket funk!

563
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
[ROCKET FUNK]

564
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:24,360
What's the time?

565
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Only 10 minutes.

566
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,360
It's still far from the time of the Hamster.

567
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
This is bad.

568
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,360
I'll try...

569
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,360
...the tornado gas pedal.

570
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Torvado gas pedal.

571
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Here it is.

572
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Torvado gas pedal.

573
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
It's still very fast.

574
00:36:52,360 --> 00:37:01,360

00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,360
You're stubborn.

764
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,360
But, you're a bit naughty.

765
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:58,360
I think you're suitable to go to the orphanage.

766
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,360
Gerhana.

767
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:12,360
Why Gerhana?

768
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,360
I want to go to the orphanage.

769
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,360
Oh.

770
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:27,360
You want to go to the orphanage.

771
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,360
Yes.

772
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,360
Alright.

773
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:42,360
Then, you can go to the orphanage.

774
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,360
Wow.

775
00:51:44,360 --> 00:52:06,360
Maybe, this is related to the eighth prince.

776
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
And Angkara.

777
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:24,360
We can do it.

778
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,360
Now, I've found the way.

779
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,360
How the speed of our lollipop...

780
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,360
can balance and even direct the speed of the wings...

781
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,360
of the queen of Venus.

782
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:47,360
Look at this.

783
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
Let me borrow it.

784
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Use both.

785
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
Hey.

786
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,360
Why are you laughing?

787
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,360
What's wrong?

788
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,360
Well, the soldier just used both of them.

789
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,360
Yes, sir.

790
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,360
I'll prove it.

791
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,360
Nick.

792
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
Stop forward.

793
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,360
Yes, sir.

794
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,360
One.

795
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
One, two, three.

796
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,360
Forward.

797
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,360
Wow.

798
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,360
So fast.

799
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,360
[The Queen of Venus]

800
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:43,360
Nick.

801
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,360
How much time do you need to count?

802
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Two minutes, sir.

803
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,360
Yes.

804
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
Two minutes.

805
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,360
Remember, how much time you need to fly?

806
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,360
15 and 10 minutes.

807
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,360
Now, with two lollipops, we can do it.

808
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,360
Two minutes.

809
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,360
Wait.

810
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,360
I have an idea.

811
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,360
What if we use three lollipops at once?

812
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,360
That's a good idea.

813
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Let's try it.

814
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,360
Come on, Fija.

815
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:19,360
One, two, three.

816
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,360
Forward.

817
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,360
Yes.

818
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Nick.

819
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
How much time do you need to count?

820
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,360
One minute, sir.

821
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
Yes.

822
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,360
Two minutes.

823
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,360
Wait.

824
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,360
What if we use four lollipops at once?

825
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,360
Four lollipops.

826
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,360
We have to try it.

827
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
Wait.

828
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,360
Give me the lollipop, Fija.

829
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,360
Nick.

830
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
How much time do you need to count?

831
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,360
One, two, three.

832
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,360
Forward.

833
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:17,360
It's so close.

834
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,360
It's like a rocket.

835
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:29,360
How much time do you need to count?

836
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:34,360
Five seconds.

837
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:45,360
We have to do it.

838
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,360
Wait.

839
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,360
What else?

840
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,360
I can do it faster than that.

841
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,360
You can do it faster than five seconds?

842
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,360
Just imagine.

843
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,360
Four lollipops.

844
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,360
It's really fast.

845
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,360
Especially five.

846
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,360
I think it's possible.

847
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Let's try it.

848
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Give me the lollipop.

849
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,360
Here you go.

850
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,360
One, two, three.

851
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,360
Wait.

852
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,360
It's so fast.

853
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Wait.

854
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:34,360
That's why.

855
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,360
This is a lesson for you, young man.

856
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,360
Don't be a coward.

857
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:48,360
Welcome to the first birthday party.

858
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Thank you.

859
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,360
I thought the girls were pretty.

860
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,360
But, it's just like her.

861
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,360
You're talking nonsense.

862
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,360
What if they get offended?

863
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,360
I don't know.

864
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,360
It's true.

865
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Shh.

866
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:13,360
By the way, who was your name?

867
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,360
I'm Vela.

868
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,360
You and I are Feli.

869
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,360
We're twins.

870
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,360
We're not twins.

871
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,360
What's that?

872
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,360
It's a statue.

873
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,360
What is it?

874
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,360
It's a statue.

875
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,360
The statue is similar.

876
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,360
The clothes are similar.

877
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,360
And another thing is...

878
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,360
our beauty is similar.

879
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,360
But, we're twins.

880
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,360
Yes.

881
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:56,360
By the way, who was your name?

882
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,360
I'm Alfa.

883
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,360
Alfa.

884
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,360
Alfa and Ryu are twins.

885
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:12,360
Which one do you want?

886
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
Which one?

887
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,360
I'll choose Alfa.

888
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,360
Okay, I'll choose Ryu.

889
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,360
But, if we get bored, we can switch.

890
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:31,360
We're not that bored.

891
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:41,360
Why are you here?

892
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:52,360
What's that?

893
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,360
This is my pet hamster.

894
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,360
Oh, your pet hamster.

895
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,360
Oh, right.

896
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,360
What's your pet hamster's name?

897
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,360
It's...

898
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,360
Angki.

899
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,360
Oh, Angki.

900
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,360
It's so cute.

901
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,360
It's like a twin.

902
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,360
It's so cute.

903
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:30,360
Be patient, Angkara.

904
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,360
You're just a hamster for a while.

905
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,360
But, you'll get that school back from Albaran.

906
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:44,360
What are they talking about?

907
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,360
Why are they so excited?

908
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,360
I'll call them.

909
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,360
It's the hamster.

910
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,360
It's okay.

911
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,360
Maybe it's hungry and wants to eat something.

912
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:05,360
Professor Tita.

913
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,360
Yes, Professor Albaran.

914
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,360
The number of students should be five.

915
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,360
Why are there six now?

916
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,360
Wow, you're smiling, Professor Albaran.

917
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,360
I'm confused, too.

918
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,360
Because the number of students should be five.

919
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,360
Why are there six?

920
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,360
Meanwhile, Rio Nilo...

921
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,360
also brought the official letter.

922
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,360
So, he's also our student.

923
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:36,360
Are you sure, Professor?

924
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,360
Well...

925
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,360
Maybe...

926
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,360
Maybe, Professor...

927
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,360
Hey, don't smile.

928
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,360
Maybe, Professor Albaran is just like me.

929
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,360
He's suffering from Picon.

930
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,360
So, he forgot to put Rio's name in the letter.

931
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,360
That's how Professor Albaran...

932
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,360
is so...

933
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,360
But, I still feel something's fishy.

934
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Maybe...

935
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,360
he has something to do with the Dark Prince...

936
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,360
and Ankara.

937
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:30,360
If that's true...

938
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,360
I have to get rid of Rio.

939
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,360
I'm tired of being Professor Albaran.

940
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,360
There's no way out.

941
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,360
I'd better find Professor Ankara...

942
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,360
or the Dark Prince.

943
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,360
This is bad.

944
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,360
Albaran is suspicious.

945
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,360
I have to tell this to the Dark Prince.

946
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:57,360
Are you okay?

947
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,360
I'm looking for Professor Ankara's voice.

948
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:16,360
We can do this.

949
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,360
It's quiet.

950
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,360
I'm back to normal.

951
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
I hope...

952
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,360
I won't be paralyzed again.

953
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,360
[Ankara]

954
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:34,360
I'm so tired.

955
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:41,360
I'm tired.

956
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Faiqa, did you hear that?

957
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,360
What voice?

958
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,360
It's Albaran's voice.

959
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,360
Did you hear that?

960
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,360
I think it's Professor Ankara's voice.

961
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,360
Professor Ankara?

962
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,360
No way.

963
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,360
Professor Albaran has given him protection.

964
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,360
That's true.

965
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,360
But...

966
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,360
But what?

967
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,360
It sounded like Professor Ankara's voice.

968
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,360
Maybe it's just a dream.

969
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,360
I don't know.

970
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,360
Where are you going?

971
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,360
I'm going out for a while.

972
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,360
You guys continue eating.

973
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
Okay.

974
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:47,360
I think he's suspicious.

975
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
I think so.

976
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,360
Let's follow him.

977
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,360
Let's go.

978
01:03:51,360 --> 01:04:10,360
You're such a jerk.

979
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,360
I'll call the police.

980
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
Let's go.

981
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:27,360
What did you call me, Ankara?

982
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
Sir.

983
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,360
I have an important message for you.

984
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,360
It's about Albaran.

985
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,360
Albaran?

986
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,360
What's wrong, Ankara?

987
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,360
I think...

988
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,360
Albaran is suspicious of Leon.

989
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,360
Because he thinks Leon has something to do with us.

990
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,360
I knew it.

991
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,360
Albaran wouldn't believe that easily.

992
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,360
Then?

993
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,360
What should we do next?

994
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,360
Calm down, Ankara.

995
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,360
I have an idea.

996
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,360
You should do your job as Leon's protector.

997
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,360
Yes, sir.

998
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
I'm sorry, sir.

999
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,360
You're such a jerk.

1000
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:30,360
My men.

1001
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,360
Come here.

1002
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,360
[Leon's men]

1003
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:44,360
I think you know what your job is.

1004
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,360
Go to that place.

1005
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,360
And make it bigger.

1006
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,360
Then, do your job.

1007
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,360
Now!

1008
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:08,360
[Leon's men]

1009
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,360
A hole.

1010
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,360
How could the protector I made be in that hole?

1011
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,360
I think someone is trying to open the door.

1012
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:51,360
I have to go home to make sure.

1013
01:06:51,360 --> 01:07:02,360
Are you okay?

1014
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,360
I think I heard professor Ankara's voice.

1015
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:12,360
No, Ankara couldn't be here.

1016
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:17,360
Because this school is protected by the dust of professor Albaran's house.

1017
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,360
I know.

1018
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,360
But, why do I hear...

1019
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:30,360
What's that?

1020
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,360
Why are you shaking?

1021
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,360
Oh, this.

1022
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:41,360
I can't tell Alfa about this.

1023
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,360
It could be a problem.

1024
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,360
It's nothing. It's not important.

1025
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,360
Okay, I have to go.

1026
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,360
What? Where are you going?

1027
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,360
I have something to do at home.

1028
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,360
And there's professor Albaran here.

1029
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,360
So, I don't have to worry.

1030
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:05,360
Okay, but be careful.

1031
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,360
Tell my parents that I miss them.

1032
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
Even though they're still sleeping.

1033
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,360
Just tell them.

1034
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,360
Of course.

1035
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,360
I'll tell them when I get home.

1036
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,360
Oh, right.

1037
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,360
I have something for you.

1038
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,360
Something?

1039
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,360
A map.

1040
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,360
Alfa.

1041
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,360
This is a map for you.

1042
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,360
Take it.

1043
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:50,360
This map is your father's.

1044
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,360
I hope it's useful.

1045
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,360
What's the use of this?

1046
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,360
You'll know later.

1047
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,360
I have to go.

1048
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:11,360
Hey, wait!

1049
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,360
There's a thief!

1050
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,360
(Thief)

1051
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:25,360
Why are you here?

1052
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,360
Don't you have friends?

1053
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,360
Poor you.

1054
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,360
Why are you asking that?

1055
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,360
Just answer it.

1056
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,360
If you don't have friends, join our gang.

1057
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,360
I'm trying to accept a new kid like you.

1058
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,360
I'm trying to get in touch with you.

1059
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,360
But, just so you know, my grandfather is the headmaster of this school.

1060
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,360
So, if you want to join us,

1061
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:57,360
you'll be cool, you'll be rich, you'll be famous.

1062
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,360
Just join us.

1063
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,360
You'll lose if you don't join us.

1064
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,360
Right.

1065
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,360
I'm not interested in your friends.

1066
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,360
A thief!

1067
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,360
Help!

1068
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,360
What's that?

1069
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:31,360
We got caught!

1070
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,360
He's so cool.

1071
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,360
But, he's not good at fighting.

1072
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,360
He's my friend.

1073
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,360
I taught him from my mom.

1074
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:50,360
There's someone!

1075
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,360
It hurts!

1076
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,360
Why are you so mean?

1077
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:17,360
Be careful!

1078
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:29,360
We got caught!

1079
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:39,360
Riyo, let's go inside.

1080
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,360
Riyo, say goodbye to our orphanage.

1081
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,360
It's called Purnama Orphanage.

1082
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,360
Yes, it's fun here.

1083
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,360
And the kids are good.

1084
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,360
Yes, if you need anything, just tell us.

1085
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,360
Let's go.

1086
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:49,360
What's that?

1087
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,360
Our friends are fainted!

1088
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,360
Let's help them!

1089
01:12:53,360 --> 01:13:03,360
Rina!

1090
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:12,360
Why are you so high?

1091
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,360
Go, go, go!

1092
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,360
Achieve all your dreams!

1093
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,360
Go, go, go!

1094
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,360
Never stop!

1095
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,360
Go, go, go!

1096
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,360
Fight with all your heart!

1097
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,360
Go, go, go!

1098
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,360
Make yourself proud!

1099
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,360
Go, go, go!

1100
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,360
Let's dream!

1101
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,360
Go, go, go!

1102
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,360
We will!
