 To be continued...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Show your spirit, get ready to find friends

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Run, run, jump, climb the stairs

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Be brave, don't give up

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Chase your dreams and hopes

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Go, go, go, reach all your dreams

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Go, go, go, run with courage

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Go, go, go, make yourself proud

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Go, go, go, let's dream

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Go, go, go, we can do it

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Go, go, go, never stop

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 That kid...

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 He took my blood, Alva!

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Hit him!

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I didn't expect that I could get the Dark Lord's blood

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Finally, the holy blood is back to me

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Go, it's time for you to go

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Come on, professor, what are you waiting for?

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Finally, I can be free from the fire prison

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Shut up!

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 How dare you to mess with us?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I will kill you all

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Beautiful queen, the jewelry you gave us is much better

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And much more luxurious than the necklace you're wearing now

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So, it's better if you give us the necklace

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Your jewelry is beautiful

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 But I don't want to trade it for my soul stone

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 This prison is priceless

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 As far as you know, it's been 1,500 years

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Oh my, this is dangerous

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 All the rumors, even my pride, are worthless

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 What's going on?

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Why is everything black?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Yes, professor

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 When Angkar was the headmaster here

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 He told him to change the color to black

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Angkar?

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Yes

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 He even changed the curriculum at school

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 He told the teachers to teach black science to the children

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Angkar is too much

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Angkar!

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Thank God, professor

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Now the classroom and classroom are back to normal

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Angkar will not like all this

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Unfortunately, Angkar will never see this place again

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Because I will not let him set foot in this school again

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 What should we do, professor?

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 With a mantra, of course

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 What else?

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 [The Mantra]

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 What's that dust, professor?

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 This is not just any dust, Agni

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I think I've heard of that dust

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 That's the dust of protection, professor

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 That's right, Agni

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Dear dust of protection

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Protect the school and the children

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 From a man named Angkar

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 [The Mantra]

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I hope that dust will not control this place again, professor

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I guarantee that it will never happen

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 That's good, professor

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Any news from Megantara?

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Not yet

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I'm still waiting for the news

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Sir, sir

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I swear, sir

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I have nothing to do with these kids, sir

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I don't want to hear any more of your betrayal, Angkar

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Now, accept your punishment, Angkar

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 [The Mantra]

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 If they don't have a thing for you

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 They will never want you, Angkar

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Sir, I don't know, sir

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 [The Mantra]

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I told you, don't protect me!

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 But if you don't protect me, you will die

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I don't care!

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I told you, don't protect me!

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But, sir

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 If you don't protect me, Angkar

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Hey, enough!

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Stay away from me!

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Maybe

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 You will never be able to avoid it again

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Professor!

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Get out of the way!

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 But, Meg, I was killed by a dark force

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 It's okay, I'm still alive

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 It's okay, we're still alive

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 We can go to school

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 But, how?

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Oh, this letter

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It's from Professor Lebaran

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Vega, keep this

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 What is this, sir?

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 That's a miracle letter

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 When you're in trouble or lost

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 You can light that letter

107
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And it will bring you back to school

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Now

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 You will all be destroyed

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 [The Dark Force]

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Professor!

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Angkara!

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Angkara!

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Don't be afraid

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 They're about to escape

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Be careful!

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Yay, we're back to school!

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Okay, let's go

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Because of you

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I'm the name of the Dark Force

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Don't be stupid

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I will punish you all

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 What is this?

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Huh?

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Professor!

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 What did I see?

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 How can a professor be mentally ill?

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I don't know

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Because this school must be chanted

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 So that the professor can enter

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Wait

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Who chanted this school?

133
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Me

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 [The Dark Force]

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Professor Lebaran

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Aldo Baran

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Aldo Baran escaped

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I will not let Aldo Baran escape

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I will not let him escape

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 When can I see you again?

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I miss you so much

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Leon

143
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I'm sorry

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I can't keep my promise to you

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I'm sorry

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I won't be a burden

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I've decided to be one of the teachers

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 To teach you

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 The teacher is Agni

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Huh? Agni?

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 This is the story, Leon

152
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Orion!

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I'm here to save you

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Avantur!

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Hey!

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 What are you doing here?

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Catch him!

158
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I've got it, Sir Ling!

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 [The Dark Force]

160
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 [The Dark Force]

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 [The Dark Force]

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 How are you?

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Who are you?

164
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Why are you here?

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I'm here to save you

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Here's the drink

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 [The Dark Force]

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 [The Dark Force]

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 [The Dark Force]

170
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 [The Dark Force]

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 [The Dark Force]

172
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 [The Dark Force]

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 [The Dark Force]

174
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Agni betrayed me

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 He used me to get revenge on you

176
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 But he poisoned your teacher

177
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And he poisoned his best friend

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 His name is Adi Balad

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 What?

180
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 My feet were poisoned?

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And?

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 How are my feet?

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Your feet are dead

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 [The Dark Force]

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 You have to listen to me, Leon

186
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 You have to get revenge, Leon

187
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 You have to get revenge on Professor Agni and Professor Adi Balad

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Because they all killed your grandfather

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 [The Dark Force]

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 [The Dark Force]

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Your Highness

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Indeed

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 The Kalung that you have been possessing

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Has been poisoned by the evil force

195
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 If you keep on possessing it

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Then your heart will be possessed by the evil force

197
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I don't want to hear anything else

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Your Highness

199
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Actually, I don't want to tell you this either

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I don't feel good about you

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 But if you keep on using it

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Then you will become a weak leader

203
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Try it

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 The queen is getting weaker, right?

205
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Right?

206
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 What do you mean?

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 You said I'm weak?

208
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Yes

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Right?

210
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Try it

211
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Weak?

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Weak or weak?

213
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 You're rude

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Your Highness

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 How about this?

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 To prove whether the queen is weak or not

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 We will have a competition

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 A game of "Nasi Pindang"

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 A trade on the street

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 If I win

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Then the Kalung will be mine

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But if the queen wins

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 The Kalung will be the queen's

224
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Then the gold and jewelry that I brought to the queen

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Will be taken by the queen

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And the competition will be decided by the queen

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 If I refuse

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Then I will lose before I even start

229
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Alright

230
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I agree

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Good

232
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I hope we win the war

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 We will win the war

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Amen

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Then we will have a flying competition

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But you will lose

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 You can't win against my daughter

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 You can't win

239
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 We will have a flying competition

240
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 As long as the queen knows

241
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 That all the students in the magic school

242
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Are good at flying

243
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Who's afraid?

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I've returned the Kalung

245
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And I

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Will take back my share

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And kick you out of the school

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Come on, professor

249
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Come on, professor

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Don't let him get away

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Don't let him get away

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Cut his side, professor

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Professor

254
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Professor

255
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Finally

256
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 My top student is back

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Take him away

258
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Take my top student away

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I will win

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I will win

261
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Go

262
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Power

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I will cut your head off

264
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Cool

265
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He's like a robot

266
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Professor

267
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Tolik

268
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 You're not the one who hugged me

269
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I forgot, professor

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Finally, professor is back

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 We're so happy

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 You can meet us again

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 We miss you so much

274
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I'm happy to meet you too

275
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And thank you

276
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 For taking care of this school

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Especially you, Lata

278
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Thank you

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Sir

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Sir

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Where are you, sir?

282
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Sir

283
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I want to apologize, sir

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I want to explain everything, sir

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Sir

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Sir, here

287
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Open it

288
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Sir

289
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 What are you doing?

290
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 This is a punishment for you, Angkara

291
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 For betraying me

292
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Sir

293
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Please listen to me, sir

294
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I didn't mean to betray you, sir

295
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 You got it all wrong, sir

296
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 We're being tricked, sir

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I don't believe you anymore, Angkara

298
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 You're so good

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 You're a coward

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 If you want to punish me

301
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's okay, sir

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 I'm willing to do it

303
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Because

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I don't know where else to go, sir

305
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 If it's not back to you, sir

306
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Sir, Sirsir School has punished me, sir

307
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And

308
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 The West has been burning my house

309
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 In the whole school, sir

310
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 So

311
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I can't go to school anymore, sir

312
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 You're a traitor

313
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Yes, sir

314
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Sir, please listen to me, sir

315
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I didn't mean to betray you, sir

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Okay, Angkara

317
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I'll give you one more chance

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And if you succeed

319
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I'll forgive you

320
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And I'll help you to take that school back

321
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Sir, please

322
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Thank you so much, sir

323
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 You're so kind, sir

324
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But if you fail

325
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 The punishment will be worse than this

326
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Okay, sir

327
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I promise, sir

328
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 This time I won't fail, sir

329
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,360
 No one will hear you now!

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
 Good, Leon! Good!

337
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,360
 Finally you understand the lesson I gave you, Leon.

338
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 You better be ready now.

339
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 Now is your time.

340
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:36,360
 Eda!

341
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,360
 Queen Venus is really nice to all of us.

342
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
 She has given us food,

343
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
 drinks,

344
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
 and shelter.

345
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,360
 Soon, she will give me her heart.

346
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 So sweet!

347
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,360
 Guys,

348
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,360
 are you sure we can defeat Queen Venus?

349
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,360
 That's why

350
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,360
 I will train you.

351
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,360
 Now, finish all of this food

352
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,360
 so you have the strength to train.

353
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,360
 Yes, sir! / Yes, sir! / Okay, then.

354
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
 Guys,

355
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 let's go!

356
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
 Let's go!

357
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
 I'll go now.

358
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 Aren't you going to join us?

359
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
 No.

360
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
 Let's go! Let's eat!

361
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
 Save some for me.

362
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 Ready, sir!

363
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
 [music]

364
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:59,360
 Buy a helmet.

365
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
 An antique color.

366
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
 Beautiful ladies.

367
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 Hi, sir.

368
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 Sir?

369
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,360
 This piece of art is divided into two.

370
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 How can a handsome man like this

371
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
 be called sir?

372
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,360
 Beautiful ladies,

373
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
 don't be shy.

374
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
 You can call me

375
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 Megantara's sister,

376
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
 or Megantara's brother.

377
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 But if it's the right one,

378
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 call me

379
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 A-A Megantara.

380
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
 Yes, sir.

381
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
 Can I ask you something?

382
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 Here's the thing.

383
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 Are you happy

384
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 using that wing?

385
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 Of course.

386
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,360
 This wing can make us fly high and fast.

387
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
 Wow!

388
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,360
 How fast can you fly?

389
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
 Very fast.

390
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,360
 Can I see

391
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,360
 how fast you can fly?

392
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
 For example,

393
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
 you can fly from here,

394
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
 to the palace,

395
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 and back here.

396
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
 Can you do that?

397
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
 Yes, sir.

398
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,360
 Here it is.

399
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
 Stopwatch.

400
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
 Here's the thing.

401
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,360
 When I press the button,

402
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
 you'll fly.

403
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
 Ready?

404
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,360
 One, two, three.

405
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:42,360
 Why are you still here?

406
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
 You said you wanted to fly.

407
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
 Why haven't you flown yet?

408
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
 When I press the button,

409
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
 you'll fly.

410
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,360
 You've flown.

411
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 You're back again.

412
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,360
 You flew to the palace,

413
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
 and then back again.

414
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
 Only five seconds.

415
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 Can you do that?

416
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
 Kids,

417
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
 to remind you that

418
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
 Professor Aldebaran is back,

419
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
 we'll have a party today.

420
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,360
 And all the classes will be canceled.

421
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,360
 Yay!

422
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:35,360
 You're smiling.

423
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
 Kids,

424
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,360
 to make this party more complete,

425
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,360
 I'll give you a feast

426
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 that you'll never refuse.

427
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,360
 The brownie!

428
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
 The brownie!

429
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 It's so good!

430
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
 I want more!

431
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:09,360
 Yum yum.

432
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
 Let's eat it all.

433
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,360
 It's so good.

434
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
 It's so good.

435
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,360
 Sorry, I'm late.

436
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,360
 Panji?

437
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 Professor Aldebaran,

438
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
 my favorite teacher.

439
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
 How are you?

440
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
 I'm fine, Panji.

441
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,360
 It's been a while since we met.

442
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
 But,

443
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 how did you get here?

444
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 The kids brought me here.

445
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 Come on, please.

446
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
 Thank you.

447
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
 (The kids brought me here)

448
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,360
 There you go.

449
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 Where's my brother?

450
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,360
 I think he asked us to go to the toilet.

451
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 Right.

452
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
 Where's my brother?

453
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
 Let's find him.

454
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,360
 Where are you going?

455
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
 (The kids brought me here)

456
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:26,360
 Where are you from?

457
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
 I've been looking for you.

458
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
 You're here.

459
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
 What are you doing here?

460
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
 I don't know.

461
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,360
 I don't know what I'm doing.

462
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
 If you're not going to eat,

463
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
 why are you here?

464
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
 Let's eat.

465
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
 Let's eat.

466
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 No.

467
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
 I'm not hungry.

468
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
 You're crying, aren't you?

469
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,360
 No, I'm not crying.

470
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
 You're lying.

471
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
 It turns out your eyes and mouth are red.

472
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
 What are you thinking?

473
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,360
 You're thinking about your brother, aren't you?

474
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,360
 Yes, Vega.

475
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,360
 I should be able to hug them now.

476
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,360
 I should be able to joke with them.

477
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,360
 I should be able to talk to them.

478
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,360
 But everything failed.

479
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,360
 Because I haven't got the 8th Pangeran blood.

480
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 It's okay, Ava.

481
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
 Be patient.

482
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
 Maybe you'll get it with your family.

483
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,360
 But I'm sure you'll get it.

484
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,360
 I'm not strong enough.

485
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
 I'm not strong enough.

486
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,360
 Yes.

487
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
 I'm strong.

488
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
 Yes.

489
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 This school will be destroyed...

490
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 ...by Leo.

491
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:33,360
 Mik, Octav, let's go.

492
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
 Try harder.

493
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
 Faster.

494
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,360
 Erik.

495
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
 Fija.

496
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
 Come on.

497
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
 Show your abilities.

498
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
 You have to be faster.

499
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,360
 Fija, did you hear what the soldiers said?

500
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
 I heard it.

501
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
 We have to be faster.

502
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
 Let's speed up.

503
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,360
 (The soldiers are getting tired)

504
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:15,360
 Soldiers.

505
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 Let's take a rest.

506
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
 We're tired.

507
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
 Yes, soldiers.

508
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
 I'm so weak.

509
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,360
 Take a rest.

510
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,360
 You have to keep training.

511
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,360
 Because you're still far behind the soldiers.

512
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,360
 How much time do we have?

513
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
 Your time.

514
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,360
 Only 15 minutes.

515
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,360
 While the soldiers are only 5 seconds behind you.

516
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,360
 The difference is still far.

517
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,360
 It's not true, soldiers.

518
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
 We can't win against Venus.

519
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
 Yes, soldiers.

520
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
 Please, don't give up.

521
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
 Remember.

522
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
 You're the best students.

523
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
 Don't give up.

524
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,360
 You have to keep training until you succeed.

525
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,360
 Okay.

526
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,360
 If you want to rest, go ahead.

527
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
 But we'll train again.

528
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
 I'm going to go now.

529
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,360
 Where are you going?

530
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,360
 Semedi.

531
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,360
 Leon.

532
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,360
 This is the school you have to destroy.

533
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,360
 You'll be a student here.

534
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,360
 And you'll change your identity.

535
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,360
 Your name is not Leon.

536
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
 But Rionelo.

537
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
 And you have to remember.

538
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,360
 You can't use your power.

539
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,360
 Especially in front of your enemies.

540
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,360
 If they find out, they can do anything to you.

541
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,360
 Just like they did to your grandfather.

542
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,360
 Do you understand, Leon?

543
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,360
 Do you understand, Rionelo?

544
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
 Yes.

545
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
 And you, Ankara.

546
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
 As long as he's in school, you're my friend.

547
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,360
 Sir.

548
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,360
 I'm not disobeying you.

549
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,360
 But I can't go back to school.

550
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
 Because the school holiday is coming.

551
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,360
 Calm down, Ankara.

552
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,360
 I have a solution.

553
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
 Change.

554
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:59,360
 Why am I a hamster?

555
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
 Now you're in.

556
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,360
 Wow, you're right.

557
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,360
 By changing into a hamster, I managed to pass this test.

558
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,360
 The protection is only for humans named Ankara.

559
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
 Not a hamster named Ankara.

560
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,360
 You're smart.

561
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,360
 Okay, I'll change my identity to be a student.

562
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,360
 I'm not a hamster.

563
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:43,360
 I'm not a hamster.

564
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:57,360
 Why am I out again?

565
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
 I told you, Ankara.

566
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,360
 You're the only one who can get in if you change into a hamster.

567
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:13,360
 Okay, sir.

568
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,360
 Good afternoon, kids.

569
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,360
 Good afternoon, sir.

570
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,360
 Give me a smile.

571
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,360
 Welcome to Sekolah Sihir.

572
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
 Let me introduce myself.

573
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
 My name is Prof. Tintan.

574
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:40,360
 I'm sure you'll be happy to live here.

575
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,360

 But, the speed of a lollipop...

765
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,360
 ...is not as fast as a winged bird.

766
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,360
 How?

767
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:35,360
 Why do we all have two wings?

768
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,360
 Two wings are for our balance.

769
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,360
 Two wings make our wings stronger.

770
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,360
 So, we can fly fast.

771
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:56,360
 Nik, Fica, Oktav, Erik.

772
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,360
 What are you doing?

773
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,360
 We're relaxing.

774
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,360
 Why are you relaxing?

775
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,360
 You should be practicing.

776
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,360
 How can we win against Queen Venus...

777
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,360
 ...if you're just relaxing?

778
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
 You should be practicing.

779
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,360
 How?

780
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,360
 Nik.

781
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,360
 Where's your lollipop?

782
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:29,360
 What are you doing?

783
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,360
 We're practicing.

784
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,360
 What are you doing here?

785
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,360
 I'm here to practice.

786
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:45,360
 Come on.

787
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,360
 Go.

788
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,360
 Why are you not doing anything?

789
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,360
 Are we all going?

790
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,360
 Yes, we're all going.

791
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
 Yes, we're practicing.

792
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,360
 No.

793
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,360
 I'm going to throw up.

794
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,360
 Are you sure?

795
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:11,360
 But, I forgot.

796
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:19,360
 You know, I'm 3,200 years old.

797
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,360
 I'm old.

798
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
 300.

799
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
 I'm old.

800
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:38,360
 You're smart.

801
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,360
 Yes, you're smart.

802
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,360
 You're stubborn.

803
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,360
 But, you're a bit naughty.

804
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:58,360
 I think you're suitable to go to the orphanage.

805
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,360
 Gerhana.

806
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:12,360
 Why Gerhana?

807
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,360
 I want to go to the orphanage.

808
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,360
 Oh.

809
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:27,360
 You want to go to the orphanage.

810
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,360
 Yes.

811
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,360
 Yes.

812
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,360
 Alright.

813
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:42,360
 Then, you can go to the orphanage.

814
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,360
 Wow.

815
00:51:44,360 --> 00:52:06,360
 Maybe, this is related to the eighth prince.

816
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
 And Angkara.

817
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,360
 We can do it.

818
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:24,360
 We can do it.

819
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,360
 Now, I've found the way.

820
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,360
 How the speed of our lollipop...

821
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,360
 can balance and even direct the speed of the wings...

822
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,360
 of the queen of Venus.

823
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:47,360
 Look at this.

824
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
 Let me borrow it.

825
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:58,360
 Use both.

826
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
 Hey.

827
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,360
 Why are you laughing?

828
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,360
 What's wrong?

829
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,360
 Well, the soldier just used both of them.

830
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,360
 Yes, sir.

831
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,360
 I'll prove it.

832
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,360
 Nick.

833
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
 Stop forward.

834
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,360
 Yes, sir.

835
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,360
 One.

836
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
 One, two, three.

837
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,360
 Forward.

838
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,360
 Wow.

839
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,360
 So fast.

840
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,360
 [The Queen of Venus]

841
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:43,360
 Nick.

842
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,360
 How much time do you need to count?

843
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,360
 Two minutes, sir.

844
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,360
 Yes.

845
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
 Two minutes.

846
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,360
 Remember, how much time you need to fly?

847
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,360
 15 and 10 minutes.

848
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,360
 Now, with two lollipops, we can do it.

849
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,360
 Two minutes.

850
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,360
 Wait.

851
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,360
 I have an idea.

852
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,360
 What if we use three lollipops at once?

853
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,360
 That's a good idea.

854
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,360
 Let's try it.

855
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,360
 Come on, Fija.

856
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:19,360
 One, two, three.

857
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,360
 Forward.

858
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,360
 Yes.

859
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:37,360
 Nick.

860
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
 How much time do you need to count?

861
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,360
 One minute, sir.

862
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
 Yes.

863
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,360
 Two minutes.

864
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,360
 Wait.

865
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,360
 What if we use four lollipops at once?

866
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,360
 Four lollipops.

867
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,360
 We have to try it.

868
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
 Wait.

869
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,360
 Give me the lollipop, Fija.

870
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,360
 Nick.

871
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
 How much time do you need to count?

872
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,360
 One, two, three.

873
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,360
 Forward.

874
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:17,360
 It's so close.

875
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,360
 It's like a rocket.

876
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,360
 It's like a rocket.

877
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:29,360
 How much time do you need to count?

878
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:34,360
 Five seconds.

879
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:45,360
 We have to do it.

880
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,360
 Wait.

881
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,360
 What else?

882
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,360
 I can do it faster than that.

883
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,360
 You can do it faster than five seconds?

884
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,360
 Just imagine.

885
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,360
 Four lollipops.

886
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,360
 It's really fast.

887
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,360
 Especially five.

888
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,360
 I think it's possible.

889
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,360
 Let's try it.

890
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,360
 Give me the lollipop.

891
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,360
 Here you go.

892
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,360
 One, two, three.

893
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,360
 Wait.

894
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,360
 It's so fast.

895
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,360
 Wait.

896
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:32,360
 That's why.

897
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,360
 That's why.

898
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,360
 This is a lesson for you, young man.

899
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,360
 Don't be a coward.

900
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,360
 Don't be a coward.

901
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:48,360
 Welcome to the first birthday party.

902
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
 Thank you.

903
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,360
 I thought the girls were pretty.

904
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,360
 But, it's just like her.

905
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,360
 You're talking nonsense.

906
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,360
 What if they get offended?

907
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,360
 I don't know.

908
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,360
 It's true.

909
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,360
 Shh.

910
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:13,360
 By the way, who was your name?

911
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,360
 I'm Vela.

912
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,360
 You and I are Feli.

913
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,360
 We're twins.

914
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,360
 We're not twins.

915
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,360
 What's that?

916
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,360
 It's a statue.

917
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,360
 It's a statue.

918
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,360
 What is it?

919
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,360
 It's a statue.

920
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,360
 The statue is similar.

921
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,360
 The clothes are similar.

922
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,360
 And another thing is...

923
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,360
 our beauty is similar.

924
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,360
 But, we're twins.

925
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,360
 Yes.

926
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:56,360
 By the way, who was your name?

927
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,360
 I'm Alva.

928
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,360
 Alva.

929
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,360
 Alva and Ryu are twins.

930
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:12,360
 Which one do you want?

931
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
 Which one?

932
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,360
 I'll choose Alva.

933
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,360
 Okay, I'll choose Ryu.

934
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,360
 But, if we get bored, we can switch.

935
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,360
 We're not that bored.

936
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,360
 We're not that bored.

937
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:41,360
 Why are you here?

938
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:48,360
 What's that?

939
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,360
 What's that?

940
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,360
 What's that?

941
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,360
 This is my pet hamster.

942
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,360
 Oh, your pet hamster.

943
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,360
 Oh, right.

944
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,360
 What's your pet hamster's name?

945
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,360
 It's...

946
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,360
 Angki.

947
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,360
 Oh, Angki.

948
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,360
 It's so cute.

949
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,360
 It's like a twin.

950
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,360
 It's so cute.

951
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:30,360
 Be patient, Angkara.

952
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,360
 You're just a hamster for a while.

953
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,360
 But, you'll get that school back from Albaran.

954
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:44,360
 What are they talking about?

955
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,360
 Why are they so excited?

956
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,360
 I'll call them.

957
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,360
 It's the hamster.

958
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,360
 It's okay.

959
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,360
 Maybe it's hungry and wants to eat something.

960
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:05,360
 Professor Tita.

961
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,360
 Yes, Professor Albaran.

962
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,360
 The number of students should be five.

963
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,360
 Why are there six now?

964
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,360
 Wow, you're smiling, Professor Albaran.

965
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,360
 I'm confused, too.

966
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,360
 Because the number of students should be five.

967
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,360
 Why are there six?

968
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,360
 Meanwhile, Rio Nilo...

969
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,360
 also brought the official letter.

970
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,360
 So, he's also our student.

971
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:36,360
 Are you sure, Professor?

972
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,360
 Well...

973
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,360
 Maybe...

974
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,360
 Maybe, Professor...

975
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,360
 Hey, don't smile.

976
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,360
 Maybe, Professor Albaran is just like me.

977
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,360
 He's suffering from Picon.

978
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,360
 So, he forgot to put Rio's name in the letter.

979
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,360
 That's how Professor Albaran...

980
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,360
 is so...

981
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,360
 But, I still feel something's fishy.

982
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,360
 Maybe...

983
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,360
 he has something to do with the Dark Prince...

984
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,360
 and Ankara.

985
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:30,360
 If that's true...

986
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,360
 I have to get rid of Rio.

987
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,360
 I'm tired of being Professor Albaran.

988
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,360
 There's no way out.

989
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,360
 I'd better find Professor Ankara...

990
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,360
 or the Dark Prince.

991
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,360
 This is bad.

992
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,360
 Albaran is suspicious.

993
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,360
 I have to tell this to the Dark Prince.

994
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:57,360
 Are you okay?

995
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,360
 I'm looking for Professor Ankara's voice.

996
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,360
 We can do this.

997
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:16,360
 We can do this.

998
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,360
 It's quiet.

999
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,360
 I'm back to normal.

1000
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
 I hope...

1001
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,360
 I won't be paralyzed again.

1002
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,360
 [Ankara]

1003
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:34,360
 I'm so tired.

1004
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:41,360
 I'm tired.

1005
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:57,360
 Faiqa, did you hear that?

1006
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,360
 What voice?

1007
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,360
 It's Albaran's voice.

1008
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,360
 Did you hear that?

1009
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,360
 I think it's Professor Ankara's voice.

1010
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,360
 Professor Ankara?

1011
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,360
 No way.

1012
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,360
 Professor Albaran has given him protection.

1013
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,360
 That's true.

1014
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,360
 But...

1015
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,360
 But what?

1016
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,360
 It sounded like Professor Ankara's voice.

1017
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,360
 Maybe it's just a dream.

1018
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,360
 I don't know.

1019
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,360
 Where are you going?

1020
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,360
 I'm going out for a while.

1021
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,360
 You guys continue eating.

1022
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
 Okay.

1023
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:47,360
 I think he's suspicious.

1024
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
 I think so.

1025
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,360
 Let's follow him.

1026
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,360
 Let's go.

1027
01:03:51,360 --> 01:04:05,360
 You're such a jerk.

1028
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,360
 You're such a jerk.

1029
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,360
 You're such a jerk.

1030
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,360
 I'll call the police.

1031
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
 Let's go.

1032
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:27,360
 What did you call me, Ankara?

1033
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
 Sir.

1034
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,360
 I have an important message for you.

1035
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,360
 It's about Albaran.

1036
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,360
 Albaran?

1037
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,360
 What's wrong, Ankara?

1038
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,360
 I think...

1039
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,360
 Albaran is suspicious of Leon.

1040
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,360
 Because he thinks Leon has something to do with us.

1041
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,360
 I knew it.

1042
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,360
 Albaran wouldn't believe that easily.

1043
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,360
 Then?

1044
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,360
 What should we do next?

1045
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,360
 Calm down, Ankara.

1046
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,360
 I have an idea.

1047
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,360
 You should do your job as Leon's protector.

1048
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,360
 Yes, sir.

1049
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
 I'm sorry, sir.

1050
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,360
 You're such a jerk.

1051
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:30,360
 My men.

1052
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,360
 Come here.

1053
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,360
 [Leon's men]

1054
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:44,360
 I think you know what your job is.

1055
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,360
 Go to that place.

1056
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,360
 And make it bigger.

1057
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,360
 Then, do your job.

1058
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,360
 Now!

1059
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,360
 [Leon's men]

1060
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,360
 [Leon's men]

1061
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,360
 [Leon's men]

1062
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,360
 [Leon's men]

1063
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,360
 [Leon's men]

1064
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,360
 A hole.

1065
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,360
 How could the protector I made be in that hole?

1066
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,360
 I think someone is trying to open the door.

1067
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:51,360
 I have to go home to make sure.

1068
01:06:51,360 --> 01:07:02,360
 Are you okay?

1069
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,360
 I think I heard professor Ankara's voice.

1070
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:12,360
 No, Ankara couldn't be here.

1071
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:17,360
 Because this school is protected by the dust of professor Albaran's house.

1072
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,360
 I know.

1073
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,360
 But, why do I hear...

1074
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:30,360
 What's that?

1075
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,360
 Why are you shaking?

1076
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,360
 Oh, this.

1077
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:41,360
 I can't tell Alva about this.

1078
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,360
 It could be a problem.

1079
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,360
 It's nothing. It's not important.

1080
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,360
 Okay, I have to go.

1081
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,360
 What? Where are you going?

1082
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,360
 I have something to do at home.

1083
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,360
 And there's professor Albaran here.

1084
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,360
 So, I don't have to worry.

1085
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:05,360
 Okay, but be careful.

1086
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,360
 Tell my parents that I miss them.

1087
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
 Even though they're still sleeping.

1088
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,360
 Just tell them.

1089
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,360
 Of course.

1090
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,360
 I'll tell them when I get home.

1091
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,360
 Oh, right.

1092
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,360
 I have something for you.

1093
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,360
 Something?

1094
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,360
 A map.

1095
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,360
 Alva.

1096
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,360
 This is a map for you.

1097
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,360
 Take it.

1098
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:50,360
 This map is your father's.

1099
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,360
 I hope it's useful.

1100
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,360
 What's the use of this?

1101
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,360
 You'll know later.

1102
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,360
 I have to go.

1103
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:11,360
 Hey, wait!

1104
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,360
 There's a thief!

1105
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,360
 (Thief)

1106
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:23,360
 Why are you here?

1107
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,360
 Why are you here?

1108
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,360
 Don't you have friends?

1109
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,360
 Poor you.

1110
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,360
 Why are you asking that?

1111
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,360
 Just answer it.

1112
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,360
 If you don't have friends, join our gang.

1113
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,360
 I'm trying to accept a new kid like you.

1114
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,360
 I'm trying to get in touch with you.

1115
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,360
 But, just so you know, my grandfather is the headmaster of this school.

1116
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,360
 So, if you want to join us,

1117
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:57,360
 you'll be cool, you'll be rich, you'll be famous.

1118
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,360
 Just join us.

1119
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,360
 You'll lose if you don't join us.

1120
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,360
 Right.

1121
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,360
 I'm not interested in your friends.

1122
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,360
 A thief!

1123
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,360
 Help!

1124
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,360
 What's that?

1125
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:27,360
 We got caught!

1126
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,360
 We got caught!

1127
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,360
 We got caught!

1128
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,360
 He's so cool.

1129
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,360
 But, he's not good at fighting.

1130
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,360
 He's my friend.

1131
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,360
 I taught him from my mom.

1132
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:50,360
 There's someone!

1133
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,360
 It hurts!

1134
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,360
 Why are you so mean?

1135
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:03,360
 Be careful!

1136
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,360
 Be careful!

1137
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,360
 Be careful!

1138
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,360
 Be careful!

1139
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,360
 Be careful!

1140
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,360
 Be careful!

1141
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,360

 Riyo, say goodbye to our orphanage.

1147
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,360
 It's called Purnama Orphanage.

 Yes, it's fun here.

1149
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,360
 And the kids are good.

1150
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,360
 Yes, if you need anything, just tell us.

1151
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,360

 Our friends are fainted!

1162
